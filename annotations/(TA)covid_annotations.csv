,,
And a study published in June showed that the viral load decreases as the immune response surges ,1,
,,
An uptick in the average viral load throughout entire communities could indicate an epidemic on the rise ,0,

,,
"Coronavirus cases are rising in the Northeast, driven by the BA.2 omicron subvariant, but experts say it appears unlikely that there will be a huge surge.",1,
,,
Increases in hospitalizations have so far been modest—possibly because immunity rose from the explosion of omicron cases over the winter—although that could change.,1,
,,
"Good ventilation is increasingly being seen as a key tool for minimizing the risk of COVID-19, according to experts.",1,
,,
"Three new studies suggest that, prior to the spread of Omicron, vaccination provided a benefit even for those who had a prior bout with COVID-19.",1,

,,
"Although Massachusetts fared better than most U.S. states during the Omicron wave, it could have done even better if a greater percentage of its population had received COVID-19 boosters.",0,
,,
"During COVID, people also lost trust in vaccines because of misinformation and politicization.",0,
,,
"As U.S. regulators consider whether to approve additional COVID-19 booster shots, experts say it will be important to tailor future vaccines to fight multiple COVID-19 variants.",0,Ambiguous - positive that new booster shots are being considered for approval but negative that vaccines need to be produced that can fight multiple variants.

,,
The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities where serious cases of COVID-19 are straining the health system.,0,
,,
"The move to ease masking guidance, federal officials say, reflects current conditions at this phase of the pandemic, including widespread immunity through vaccination and prior infection as well as better access to testing and treatments.",1,
,,
Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen to half those of the peak of the surge in mid-January.,1,
,,
Hospitalizations—a metric that lags behind new case counts—also are declining significantly across the country. ,1,
,,

,,
"We will spend more time outside, and the virus doesn’t like the sun and the warmer temperatures.",1,This sentence is a little strange. I think maybe the phrasing of the virus “liking”  is what is throwing me off.
,,
"As the emergence of the omicron variant showed, highly transmissible mutations in SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can change the trajectory of the pandemic quickly.",0,
,,
"But the chances that the variant will be another nightmare are very, very slim.",1,
,,
"While the omicron variant has been less severe than its predecessors, and vaccines have significantly reduced that severity further in people who have gotten their shots, the high transmissibility of the variant drove case rates to record highs in the United States. ",0,
,,
"Case counts and hospitalizations are on the decline, but death rates lag behind those metrics.",0,
,,
"Daily deaths are higher today than they were during the peak of last fall’s Delta wave, and have plateaued at about 2,500 per day.",0,

,,
Hospitalizations are also falling.,1,
,,
"While we are not out in the clear yet, especially in poorly vaccinated regions of the U.S., the sharp downturn in cases is cause for optimism.",1,
,,
"To prevent being overwhelmed again, we should be proactive now in putting a preparedness system in place.",1,
,,
Yet this yearning for ‘normal’ ignores the reality that our society before COVID-19 was anything but normal.,0,
,,
"Instead it was those very conditions that allowed for terrible inequities and outsized impacts on America’s poor, which still continue today.",0,
,,
But four rapid tests and a mask will not be enough to end the pandemic.,0,
,,
"Perhaps the biggest problem is that there is still a huge amount of viral transmission, with around 175,000 new daily cases.",0,
,,
Less than two thirds of Americans are fully vaccinated—defined as two doses of Pfizer or Moderna or one dose of Johnson & Johnson—which does not provide as much protection as it did before Omicron.,0,
,,
"Only a quarter of Americans have received a booster dose, which provides the highest level of protection against infection, hospitalization, and death.",0,
,,
"There are ongoing inequities in vaccination, including racial inequities, with Black and Hispanic populations being vaccinated at a lower rate compared to white populations.",0,
,,
"Hospitalizations among the under 5 hit record levels during the Omicron surge, yet vaccines are not yet licensed for this age group.",0,

Only 24% of children aged 5-11 and 57% of those aged 12-17 are fully vaccinated.,0,
,,
"Around 7 million Americans have weakened immune systems from transplants, cancer treatment, rheumatoid arthritis medications, or other medical conditions, and they could get very ill if they get COVID-19.",0,
,,
Yet this push toward returning to normal seems to matter-of-factly ignore them.,0,
,,
"There is a serious risk of further variants arising, especially with inequitable and low vaccination coverage in much of the world due to supply hoarding.",0,
,,
Distributing a few rapid tests and masks and hoping that this wave disappears and will be the end of the U.S. pandemic is not a sound approach.,0,
,,
"Even with the current variants in circulation, we could see further waves, such as was seen in the South in past summers, especially in poorly vaccinated states, and as people move indoors to escape the heat and humidity.",0,
,,
"Rapid tests identify contagious people before they get symptoms, allowing people to avoid spreading the infection, thus breaking the cycles of transmission.",1,
,,
"With the arrival of new antiviral drugs, such as Paxlovid, and data showing early antiviral use with Remdesivir is more effective",1,This sentence is strange. What is occurring with the arrival of the new drugs?
,,
These medicines can reduce your chances of being hospitalized or dying if they are taken soon enough after symptoms begin,1,
,,
"The U.S. is the only high-income nation without mandatory federal sick pay, and this will continue to be a huge barrier to controlling COVID-19.",0,

,,
Vaccines lay the best foundation for countries to reduce circulation of the virus and eventually get their economies and societies back on track.,1,
,,
"National coronavirus cases are trending in the right direction, according to the Biden administration’s top doctors, but many states are still seeing increases in infections as the omicron variant’s wave remains far from over.",0,Slightly ambiguous - the fact that the cases are trending in the right direction is positive but the fact that omicron is far from over is a negative sentiment
,,
"That’s a drop from the previous high of nearly 800,000 cases reported on average each day in mid-January.",1,
,,
"As these numbers indicate, in some parts of the country, we are seeing the number of daily cases caused by the omicron variant beginning to decline",1,

,,
"She noted “steep declines” in cases in areas that first saw omicron surges, like New York, Rhode Island and Connecticut.But more than 20 states are seeing increasing case rates, including Alabama, North Dakota, Arizona and Hawaii.",0,
,,

"But if the pattern follows the trend that we're seeing in other places, such as the Northeast, I believe that you will start to see a turnaround throughout the entire country,",1,Ambiguous - don’t know what the trend in the North East is.

"Also, the second booster provided little extra protection against COVID-19 when compared to the initial three doses.",0,
,,
"While the third dose – or first booster – of COVID-19 vaccines was highly effective in preventing the severe form of COVID-19, the protection afforded against infection lasted for less than four to six months.",0,
,,
"In addition to the inability of the current COVID-19 vaccines to provide long-term immunity, some researchers believe that frequent or constant exposure to foreign molecules found in an infectious agent may cause immune “exhaustion.”",0,
,,
"Evidence also suggests that in severe cases of COVID-19, the killer T cells may be exhibiting immune exhaustion and therefore be unable to mount a strong immune response.",0,
,,
Another reason why the mRNA vaccines have failed to induce sustained antibody and memory response may be related to ingredients called adjuvants.,0,
,,
"While the current vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease, the next phase of vaccine development will need to focus on how to trigger a long-lived antibody response that would last for at least a year, making it likely that COVID-19 vaccines will become an annual shot.",1,Ambiguous - the vaccines being effective is positive but the need for a next phase of vaccines is negative 
,,
"After months of soaring deaths and infections, COVID-19 cases across the United States are declining even more sharply than experts anticipated.",1,
,,
"This is expected to continue, and rates of serious illness and death will plummet even faster than cases, as high-risk populations are vaccinated.",1,
,,
Even academics who have spent the pandemic delivering ominous warnings have shifted their tone to cautiously optimistic now that vaccination rates are exploding.,1,
,,
Anthony Fauci had been citing August as the month by which the U.S. could vaccinate 70 to 80 percent of the population and reach herd immunity.,1,
,,
"Despite some concerns about new coronavirus variants, Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me that he doesn’t see viral mutation as a reason to expect that most people couldn’t be well protected within that time frame.",1,
,,
"If all of this holds true, it would mean that many aspects of pre-pandemic life will return even before summer is upon us.",1,
,,
"Because case numbers guide local policies, much of the country could soon have reason to lift many or even most restrictions on distancing, gathering, and masking.",1,
,,
"Pre-pandemic norms could return to schools, churches, and restaurants. Sports, theater, and cultural events could resume.",1,
,,
"People could travel and dance indoors and hug grandparents, their own or others’.",1,
,,
Pre-pandemic complaints about a crowded subway car or a mediocre sandwich could be replaced by the awe of simply riding a bus or sitting in a diner.,1,
,,
"In short, the summer could feel revelatory. The dramatic change in the trajectory and tenor of the news could give a sense that the pandemic is over.",0,Ambiguous -the change in the news is a positive but false sense that the pandemic is over is negative.
,,
The life expectancy in the United States is now a year shorter than before COVID-19.,0,
,,
"But for all the failures that led to this point, the U.S. does finally seem to be experiencing some protective effects of population-level immunity.",1,
,,
Recent research from Columbia University estimates that the U.S. is already much closer to Fauci’s stated threshold of 70 to 80 percent vaccination than our case numbers suggest.,1,
,,
"Owing to minimal and patchwork testing efforts, lead researcher Jeff Shaman told me, the actual number of infections in the U.S. has likely been about five times higher than reported.",0,
,,
"This does not alter the goal of vaccinating as many people as possible, but it does mean that while vaccines are rolling out, transmission rates should fall much more rapidly than if the population were all totally susceptible to the virus.",1,
,,
"In some parts of the United States that have been hit extremely hard by the virus, the numbers give a sense that—if vaccination continues apace—the worst is behind us in those areas.",1,
,,
"In North and South Dakota, where leaders have been reluctant to require preventive measures, the per capita death rate is about 34 percent higher than the national average, and 13 percent of the population has had a confirmed case.",0,
,,
"“That probably means that 60 or 65 percent of the population has been infected there,” Shaman said. “That could mean they’re creeping up on herd immunity.”",1,
,,
"Indeed, North Dakotans have seen relatively few cases this winter, even while most of the U.S. saw a horrific surge.",1,
,,
"For the past six days, the state has reported zero COVID-19 deaths.",1,
,,
The warming weather and longer days should also decrease covid transmission.,1,
,,
"In much of the world, summers have proved safer than winters during the pandemic",1,
,,
" Light and heat can kill the virus directly, but their main effect seems to be making the world more hospitable for us simply to go outside, be social, move our bodies, and improve our baseline levels of health.",1,
,,
"By August, he told me, he hopes to travel with his family. The pandemic expert and former assistant secretary of homeland security Juliette Kayyem told me much the same last month: “I have plans to travel abroad in August. I feel like the world will start to move well before then.”",1,
,,
"A beautiful, COVID-free summer may be a vision of hope, and possibly a reality for many, but optimistic projections about the coming months in the U.S. can mean losing sight of a far more unsettling global picture. ",0,
,,
"As things get better, the world could fall into the same patterns that got us to the point of nearly half a million American deaths. ",0,
,,
"“I’m feeling generally optimistic for the U.S. this summer,” Omer says. “But I’m also having nightmares.”",0,
,,
Under no circumstances is the coronavirus simply going to disappear this summer. ,0,
,,
"Cases will drop, and restrictions will lift in many places. But rather than an abrupt end to the pandemic, the coming months will be more like the beginning of an extended and still-volatile tail of the outbreak globally. ",0,
,,
"Regardless of how quickly the immediate threat of viral illness subsides in the U.S., America’s choices in the coming weeks and months could mean the difference between a pandemic that ends this year and one that haunts everyone indefinitely.",0,
,,
"Rapid testing will be key to containing local outbreaks, especially next fall and winter.",1,
,,
We also have a bad record of accepting lifesaving vaccines when they are on offer.,0,
,,
"Even assuming that almost everyone gets their shots as soon as possible, the Columbia researchers estimate that in the U.S. alone, roughly 29 million additional cases could occur between now and July, depending on how Americans decide to act and which restrictions states choose to lift.",0,
,,
"Variant strains that increase the transmissibility of the virus could also throw these estimates off, Shaman noted. As the virus mutates, the reliability of immunity from prior infections also changes.",0,
,,
"The recent outbreak in Manaus, Brazil, suggested that even high levels of past infection didn’t necessarily protect a population for long.",0,
,,
"Fundamentally, we still do not know how herd immunity will work—if it even does.",0,
,,
"If it turns out that vaccinated people can still carry and spread the virus, then a group cannot assume that they are protected because people around them are vaccinated.",0,
,,
"In a place with low levels of immunity, each dose of the vaccine is more valuable than it would be elsewhere—more likely to save a life or prevent a chronic disease.",1,
,,
"Such an approach leaves pockets of the country open to surges in death and disease, despite national averages falling.",0,
,,
"As Bansal put it, even assuming that the vaccines do make herd immunity possible, the path will not be a straight line so much as “playing a game of whack-a-mole with COVID outbreaks.”",0,
,,
"Vietnam, for example, is a country of 97 million people that has had fewer than 1,600 cases of COVID-19 and 35 deaths.",1,
,,
"They have done an exemplary job of controlling the virus, and presumably have very low levels of immunity.",1,Ambiguous - controlling the virus well is positive but having low immunity is negative
,,
"Nonetheless, the current scheme of vaccine production—wherein every country is on its own to produce or procure vaccines from private companies selling them at a profit—leads to redundancies at every level, from innovation to distribution, and severe misallocation when comparing one population with another.",0,
,,
This haphazard approach will mean deaths among high-risk people around the world who could’ve been saved by doses that went to teenage Americans this summer.,0,
,,
Providing the virus with new places to spread will allow it to linger with us indefinitely.,0,
,,
"The longer it sticks around, the more time it has to mutate—which is bad news for the entire world, Americans included.",0,
,,
"As long as there are large swaths of people who are unprotected, then we’re going to see variants continue to pop up.",0,
,,
"If we are lucky, year over year, SARS-CoV-2 will evolve to cause milder disease than it has these past two years.",1,
,,
"It never again produced the same level of mortality as it did during its first two years, but the virus continues to evolve and kill hundreds of thousands of people every year. Most of us have come to accept this as inevitable.",0,
,,
"For the coronavirus, that fate is not yet entirely sealed. It could still be avoided if we can draw as close as possible to global herd immunity, not a patchwork of immunized nations.",1,
,,
"This summer could bring cause for celebration over not simply having made it through this morbid winter alive, but having built a system that can end this pandemic—and stop the next one.",1,
,,
Children under 12 in the United States will soon have one more layer of protection to keep them safe from COVID-19.,1,
,,
"Once the CDC issues its recommendation, the 28 million eligible U.S. children in this age group will have the opportunity to receive the Pfizer shot through health departments, medical institutions, doctor’s offices and pharmacies, as well as school and community-based sites.",1,
,,
"Pfizer released new data on Oct. 22, 2021, stating that its vaccine is almost 91% effective at preventing COVID-19 in that age group, with similar tolerability and antibody responses to that seen in older age groups.",1,
,,
Moderna has also released preliminary results showing that its low-dose vaccine is safe and produces a strong immune response in children ages 6 to 11 years.,1,
,,
"Vaccines, which work by teaching your immune system to make disease-fighting antibodies without giving you the actual disease, have emerged as the most important tool that we currently have to prevent severe COVID-19.",1,
,,
"As of Oct. 21, 2021, more than 6 million American children have tested positive for COVID-19.",0,
,,
"Cases in children rapidly increased during the delta variant surge, which coincided with the opening of in-person school across much of the country. Children now account for a quarter of new weekly cases.",0,
,,
"While severe disease and hospitalization from COVID-19 are far more rare in children than in adults, intensive care admission and the need for invasive ventilation do occur in children.",0,
,,
"There have been over 1.9 million COVID-19 cases in children ages 5 to 11, with nearly 100 deaths.",0,
,,
"Rates of COVID-19 hospitalization among children and adolescents rose to the highest rates ever in August and September 2021, with over 8,300 children in the 5-11 age group hospitalized since the beginning of the pandemic.",0,
,,
"Many children hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions, but one-third of them do not.",0,
,,
"Additionally, more than 5,200 children have been diagnosed with the rare but serious condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, in the weeks after COVID-19 infection.",0,
,,
"The pandemic has also harmed children’s social, emotional and mental well-being and delayed their education progress.",0,
,,
"Safe and effective vaccines are one of the most promising ways that children can be protected from COVID-19, prevent spread and have as little disruption as possible in their schooling and everyday life.",1,
,,
"In adolescents ages 12 to 18, the vaccine was shown to reduce hospitalizations by 93% from June through September 2021.",1,
,,
The Pfizer data also showed that the vaccine in that age group seems to provide similar high levels of protective antibody responses to those seen in older age groups. And the antibodies produced demonstrated an ability to neutralize the delta variant.,1,
,,
The answers were simpler when we thought we could vaccinate our way to herd immunity. But vaccinations in the U.S. have plateaued.,0,
,,
The Delta variant and waning immunity against transmission mean herd immunity may well be impossible even if every single American gets a shot.,0,
,,
"So when COVID-related restrictions came back with the Delta wave, we no longer had an obvious off-ramp to return to normal.",0,
,,
"What is clear, however, is that case numbers, the metric that has guided much of our pandemic thinking and still underlies CDC’s indoor-masking recommendation for vaccinated people, are becoming less and less useful.",0,
,,
"Even when we reach endemicity—when nearly everyone has baseline immunity from either infection or vaccination—the U.S. could be facing tens of millions of infections from the coronavirus every year, thanks to waning immunity and viral evolution.",0,
,,
"Breakthrough cases are largely mild; 10,000 of them will cause only a fraction of the hospitalizations and deaths of 10,000 COVID cases in the unvaccinated.",1,
,,
"The more highly vaccinated a community is, the less tethered case numbers are to the reality of the virus’s impact.",0,
,,
"We don’t know how much immunity may continue to wane, how long the effects of a booster last, the exact incidence of long COVID in the vaccinated, or if a new variant will upend even the best-laid plans.",0,
,,
"A collapsed health-care system means more people will die, not just of COVID-19 but from other treatable diseases and injuries.",0,
,,
"Preliminary data suggest vaccines do reduce the risk of long COVID, but exactly how much is unclear given the uncertainties in diagnosing it.",1,
,,
"But in addition to hospitalizations, Gounder suggests we should also consider the risk of long COVID.",0,
,,
"By the time hospitalizations start to rise, a bigger increase may already be baked in with people already infected but not yet sick enough to see a doctor.",0,
,,
Vaccinating kids will protect them individually and help dampen transmission from and among them.,1,
,,
The risk of hospitalization for an unvaccinated person over 80 is 25 times that for an unvaccinated person under 18.,0,
,,
"Even when the coronavirus is endemic, it will still make people sick and it will still cause deaths and hospitalizations.",0,

"This infrastructure is not yet in place, nor do many Americans have easy access to high-quality masks.",0,

But this policy lever simply has limited impact on hospitalizations.,0,
,,
"Some pandemic statistics are foggy, but the current decline of COVID-19 is crystal clear.",1,

,,
"the new variant has been estimated to be 50% more easily transmitted than common variants, though it appears to affect people's health in the same way.",0,

the increased transmissibility is believed to arise from a change in the virus's spike protein that can allow the virus to more easily enter cells.,0,
