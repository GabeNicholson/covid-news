The Moravian College women's tennis team had excitement swirling around the program in 2020.
The Greyhounds put together a lineup loaded with talented players and were about a week away from their first match. That's when COVID-19 struck, shutting down the spring season and leaving the team without an opportunity to compete in a single match.
Despite losing some key seniors from last year's squad, the returning players were determined to prove themselves this spring. And that's exactly what they did.
Moravian won its first 11 matches of the 2021 season, which included a 5-4 marathon victory over Scranton in the Landmark Conference tournamen championship.
""We had a really good team [in 2020] and a really great chance at doing well, but what happened was out of our control,"" interim head coach Mariana Freitas said. ""We graduated two starters last year and we figured this year we weren't going to be quite as strong, but our goal remained the same: to win a conference title, especially because we have five seniors. We kind of knew that it was now or never and we had to 
make this happen because we're going to rebuild next year. This was our number one goal.""
Landmark Conference title tilt
The match against the Royals was intense and often nerve-racking. The two power teams squared off on May 9 at the Breidegam Fieldhouse on Moravian's campus. Unfortunately, only two courts were available for use during the championship, which meant a lengthy match ensued.
Scranton jumped out early by winning all three doubles matches, forcing the Greyhounds to win five of the six singles matches. Fortunately for Moravian, singles is exactly where it excels.
After receiving straight-set victories from Emma Angle at No. 1 singles and Brooke Adams at No. 3 singles, the Greyhounds focused their attention on three other positions in which they trailed.
Angle's sister, Mary, who plays No. 2 singles, along with No. 5 Kristen Cassidy and No. 6 Madison Figiel all dropped their first set and were forced to make a comeback. Not only did the three complete the comeback, but they did so in dominant fashion, giving the Greyhounds enough for the win.
""It was unbelievable and I don't have words to describe that match. It took us a little over 9 hours and we had a feeling it would come down to the last match. It was probably the closest match we've had all year,"" Freitas said. ""Give credit to Scranton because they've always played good doubles, whereas we play much better singles. We put ourselves in a situation, down 3-0, obviously not ideal. There was a huge amount of pressure because every girl playing singles knew what was going on in the other match and what her job was. That creates a huge amount of pressure.""
National berth
With that victory and a quick turnaround, the Greyhounds traveled to the NCAA Division III tournament in Rome, Georgia.
The Greyhounds won their first-round match at nationals, another 5-4 thriller, this time over Transylvania College of Lexington, Kentucky.
Once again, Moravian was trailing after the doubles matches, just to storm back in singles and claim victory. After fighting off leg and hand cramps, it was top player Emma Angle who clinched victory for the Greyhounds.
""It was all very exciting. It was kind of crazy because it's a rushed process, a nine-hour match [against Scranton], then the next day we found out who we were playing and where we were going for nationals. Then we're on a plane to Georgia to play a team we didn't know much about,"" Freitas said. ""The one thing with this team is every time we step on the court, we bring it all out and leave it out there. We knew it was going to be a competitive match, but we weren't sure what the outcome would be. Once we were done with doubles, we knew what we had to do, what we've done all season, and that's play great singles tennis. It came down to Emma at No. 1 singles, and we knew she had the experience to pull out the win, and that's what she did.""
In the second round of nationals, the Greyhounds fell quickly to one of the premier Division III women's tennis teams in the country - Wesleyan University, located in Middletown, Connecticut. The Cardinals are still competing in the national tournament and will play their quarterfinal round match when tournament play resumes on May 24. Meanwhile, Moravian finished its season with a record of 11-1.
Local standouts
The top three singles players for Moravian - the Angle sisters (Northampton High School graduates) and Adams (Bethlehem Catholic graduate) - are seniors and have been rock solid for the Greyhounds all season, and throughout their careers.
Emma Angle finished the year with a 9-1 record at No. 1 and claimed Landmark Player of the Year honors. Angle was also Moravian College's Co-Outstanding Senior Female Athlete of the Year.
""No one is more deserving than Emma, because out of everyone, she works harder day-in and day-out on the court and in the gym. She took it all this year and became dominant, and that's because of her dedication. Even on the off days, she was out hitting with teammates or one of the players on our men's team. Always focused on getting better every day,"" said Freitas.
Mary Angle also saw great success for the Greyhounds, posting a 7-3 record at No. 2 singles, while Adams is considered one of the more consistent players on the team, posting a 9-1 mark at No. 3 singles.
Perhaps what's most impressive for the Angle sisters and Adams is their time management skills. All three are nursing majors in a very competitive program that demands almost all of their time.
""It's not easy and sometimes the student-athletes can't keep up with nursing and athletics because it's a lot. But these three girls somehow make it work,"" Freitas said. ""They have clinicals twice a week, all day long, then straight to practice. They spend so many hours in the hospital working night shifts, then they play conference matches and still find ways to win. It's really not easy to balance a career in nursing with athletics, but all three did it. What's better than them being great students and players, they are great women, some of the best in our program.""

6,"For more than a decade cross-country skiers from across Montana have looked forward with anticipation to the Silver Crest Nordic Challenge Ski Races, held each year in the late Winter months at the Kings Hill Winter Recreation Area six miles south of Neihart off U.S. Highway 89.
However, for the past two years the cross-country skiing competition did not occur due to COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier this month the Silver Crest Trails Association announced the return of the Silver Crest Nordic Challenge, which is open to both novice and seasoned cross-country skiers.
The day of competitive Nordic races, featuring both skate and classic cross-country skiing styles will take place on Saturday, March 19 beginning at 10 a.m. The competition will include both youth and adult divisions with distances varying from 2.1 km to 18.6 km on the groomed trails of the Kings Hill Winter Recreation Area. These will be all-comers races for the entire family, and spectators are welcome.
The Nordic Challenge Ski Races are a part of a statewide race series, the Montana Nordic Cup, with the Silver Crest Trails Nordic Challenge scheduled as the final event of this year's Montana Nordic Cup series.The Silver Crest Trails Association (SCTA) expects to host as many as 50 cross-country skiers at the event from across the region.
Awards will be presented for top three male/female finishers for both skate and classic techniques. Entry fees vary from $5 to $25 depending on race length.
The trail system at the Kings Hill Winter Recreation Area was established in the early 1980's. For more than 40 years the all-volunteer membership of the Silver Crest Trails Association has dedicated itself to maintaining the 12 miles of cross-country ski and snowshoe trails found at the Kings Hill Winter Recreation Area.
More than 500 volunteer hours are donated annually by SCTA members, who work in partnership with the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest to ensure the general public has access to the trail system to use free of charge through the winter months. In addition to the Nordic Ski Race, theSCTA also hosts a free learn to Ski Clinic, a Winter Trails Day and a Moonlight Ski event.

15,"The Economic and Social Research Institute issued the following news:On Wednesday 2 November 2021, Prof Alan Barrett (ESRI, Director) and Prof Martina Lawless (Research Professor) are addressing the Seanad Special Select Committee on the Withdrawal of the UK from the EU to discuss the impact of the UK/EU trade and cooperation agreement on the Irish economy, households and businesses.We would like to thank the Committee for inviting us here today to discuss the impact that Brexit and the trade and cooperation agreement between the EU and UK are having on the Irish economy and the potential broader impacts of Brexit for Ireland into the future.Throughout the trade negotiation process taking place during 2020, the risks inherent in a ""Hard"" Brexit where no deal was reached were extensively discussed. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement signed in December 2020 meant that tariff and quota free trade was retained between the UK and EU. It therefore avoided the most negative potential economic scenario of high tariffs impeding Irish trade with the UK. However, the Agreement did not retain the status quo of free market access and a range of non-tariff barriers in the form of new regulatory and customs procedures were put in place from the start of January 2021.We have been examining the impact of the increased costs associated with these changes to trade requirements over recent months. An important issue to take account of when examining recent trade figures is how to isolate the impact of Brexit from other factors, most specifically the changes in trade flows across the past year and a half as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We have been doing this by comparing trade flows between the UK and all EU member states with trade in the same products across all global trade partners in order to separate the UK-specific Brexit effect from the impact of COVID-19 which applies to international trade more widely.For overall trade between the UK and EU, the direct impact of Brexit has led to a 36 per cent decline in aggregate EU imports from the UK and a fall in exports to the UK of 24 per cent. The time path of the Brexit impact shows that the reductions in both directions of trade were particularly sharp in January and February followed by some recovery in March. The subsequent effects, from April to July, have been relatively stable. This direct impact of Brexit estimated by our statistical model accounts for about two-thirds of the observed year-on-year change in trade with the remainder due to other factors such as COVID-19 disruptions to trade.For Ireland, we estimate the direct impact of Brexit has been to reduce imports coming from the UK to Ireland by 45 per cent. For exports from Ireland to the UK, in contrast, we estimate that very little of the reduction observed over the past year can be attributed solely to Brexit. However, although the impact of Brexit on total exports has so far been limited, some individual sectors have faced substantial reductions in their exports to Great Britain. In particular, the food and beverages sectors have experienced very large falls in their exports to Great Britain that can be linked directly to a Brexit impact - reductions of around 25 per cent for food exports and over 40 per cent reduction in beverages exports in the first half of 2021.The effects of Brexit in the first half of 2021 have therefore been quite asymmetric, with a much larger change in imports than in exports. The share of Ireland's imports coming from the UK was 33 per cent in 2015 before the Brexit referendum and is now just 12 per cent. The share of the UK in Irish exports has fallen from 14 to 8 per cent in the same period. The uneven impact on imports rather than exports can be explained by the immediate introduction of customs requirements from the EU side but a more gradual phased-in approach on the UK side. This means that the risks posed by Brexit in terms of increased costs to Irish exporters have not fully materialised with further changes to customs requirements scheduled to be introduced by the UK in January and July 2022.When we look at how Brexit has impacted trade, we find clearly that all of the decline in Irish-UK trade since January 2021 is driven by Great Britain. In contrast, trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland trade has increased considerably. The increase has been primarily on the side of imports coming from Northern Ireland which have grown by close to 90 per cent as a result of Brexit. In 2015, Northern Ireland accounted for around 1.5 per cent of both total Irish imports and exports. This year, the share of Northern Ireland has gone up to 5 per cent of total Irish imports. The food and beverages sectors showed particularly large increases in terms of the shares of imports originating in Northern Ireland.While the increase in Irish imports from Northern Ireland is significant, it does not offset the decline in trade with Great Britain. Trade has also been diverted to other members of the European Union and to the rest of the world as shown by the changes in transport routes with the increase in direct shipping to Europe suggesting both a change in Irish supply chains and also avoidance of the UK landbridge. Data released by the CSO on volumes handled by Irish ports show that the tonnages going from Irish to UK ports in the second quarter of 2021 were down 18 per cent compared to the second quarter of 2019 and a similar reduction in percentage terms for tonnages arriving. I am comparing to 2019 to avoid the complicating factor of COVID-19 in the 2020 figures.One risk which we drew attention to in previous appearances before this Committee was how increased costs of trade might feed into consumer prices. Although inflation overall has picked up substantially in recent months, we note that food prices have been relatively stable. This was the area where concern was most focused regarding the impact of Brexit given the large share of grocery imports coming from the UK and suggests that supply chain adjustment by firms have mitigated much of the potential risk in this particular area.A number of potential long-run impacts of Brexit are still unknown, particularly in regard to regulatory divergence which may increase trade costs further between the UK and the EU. Limited international travel during the COVID-19 pandemic means that we have yet to see what, if any, changes Brexit might bring to migration patterns with restrictions on migration into the UK potentially leading to larger flows into Ireland. Likewise, with the UK outside of the EU Single Market, the attractiveness of Ireland to FDI that may have located in the UK may increase further.The growth in trade with Northern Ireland and its unique status in terms of access to both the EU and UK markets could potentially feed into broader economic linkages across the island, with enhanced cooperation in economic and other areas being supported by the Shared Island initiatives of the government. While this will be seen in positive terms by some, it should be acknowledged that others will see the increased trade as resulting from an obstacle imposed on NI/GB trade by the Northern Ireland Protocol. It remains to be seen how the ongoing dispute with regard to the Protocol will be resolved and whether any resulting changes to the Protocol will see a partial reversal of the increased trade between Ireland and Northern Ireland. More generally in relation to the Protocol, continued uncertainty with regard to its operation is likely to be limiting the extent to which Northern Ireland can benefit from its unique status. A successful resolution could see increased investment in Northern Ireland and, in the long run, a strengthened Northern Ireland economy which would be positive for all on the island of Ireland.We would be happy to take questions from the Committee.[Category: Economics]MSTRUCK-7653672 MSTRUCK",Economic &amp; Social Research Institute Researchers Address Seanad Special Select Committee on Withdrawal of UK From E.U.
16,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, Jan. 27 -- Beth Franco, executive director of the Disability Rights South Carolina, Columbia, has issued a public comment on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rule entitled ""Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency"". The comment was written on Dec. 28, 2020, and posted on Jan. 26, 2021:* * *Disability Rights South Carolina (DRSC) appreciates the opportunity to submit comments on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Interim Final Rule ""Additional Policy and Regulatory Revisions in Response to the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency.""DRSC is the Protection and Advocacy (P&A) agency for South Carolina. P8iA agencies are authorized under various federal statutes to provide legal representation and related advocacy services, and to investigate abuse and neglect of individuals with disabilities in a variety of settings.The Families First Coronavirus Response Act (FFCRA), signed into law on March 18, includes an option for states to receive enhanced federal Medicaid funding. In exchange for the additional funds, states must agree to comply with maintenance of effort (MOE) protections. These protections help ensure individuals are able to get and stay covered during the crisis and receive needed services. The FFCRA includes an explicit requirement to preserve enrollee's existing benefits - both their enrollment in Medicaid overall, and the services for which they have been eligible. At a time of such turmoil. Congress chose to protect enrollees and ensure access to services by maintaining the ""status quo.""We are writing to express our deep concern about several provisions of this Interim Final Rule (IFR). In a reversal of CMS's stated policy from March to October 2020, this IFR would now allow states to impose numerous types of coverage restrictions for individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid, including reduced benefits; reduced amount, duration, and scope of services; increased cost sharing; and reduced post-eligibility income. The IFR will also result in terminations for some individuals who should not be terminated. We oppose these revisions to the MOE, which are inconsistent with the FFCRA and will result in harm for Medicaid enrollees. We also oppose allowing states to circumvent required transparency procedures for 1332 waivers and receive enhanced funding despite refusing to cover COVID-19 vaccination for some Medicaid enrollees. We recommend that CMS withdraw these provisions.Reduction of Optional BenefitsThis rule gives states sweeping authority to reduce optional Medicaid benefits; cut the amount, duration and scope of benefits; increase utilization management; increase cost sharing; and reduce post-eligibility income -all with no consequences for their enhanced matching funds under the FFCRA. These changes contravene the letter and intent of the statute, and will result in significant harm for enrollees.Optional Medicaid benefits include essential services like physical and occupational therapy, dental and vision services, and home and community-based services. After the previous economic downturn in 2008, many states made significant cuts to each of these services. Cuts to these services will cause significant harm.Reductions in the Amount, Duration and Scope of ServicesThe IFR would allow states to change the amount, duration, and scope of services. For example, when states faced budget constraints after the Great Recession, some states placed numerical caps on benefits like physician visits and hospital days. While these capped services may have been adequate for some enrollees, in many cases they were likely not sufficient for other populations, such as some people with chronic illnesses and disabilities.Prior Authorization and Utilization Management RequirementsThe IFR would also allow states to impose new prior authorizations and other utilization management requirements. These can harm Medicaid enrollees and providers in typical times, and these issues are likely to be significantly exacerbated during COVID-19. Presently, many providers are overwhelmed caring for COVID-19 patients. Increased prior authorizations will divert them from that essential work.Moreover, overloaded clinician offices and limited in-person visits make it more likely patients will ""fall through the cracks"" and not get their medications or other services when a prior authorization is needed. This concern is backed up by survey research, which reports that of the 52% of people whose families skipped or postponed care during the previous three months due to coronavirus, 82% did so because the doctor's office was closed or had limited appointments.Increased Cost-SharingThe IFR would allow states to increase cost sharing, which would also harm Medicaid enrollees. Research over the last four decades has consistently concluded that the imposition of cost sharing on low-income populations reduces both necessary and unnecessary care and correlates with increased risk of poor health outcomes. Further, the pandemic increases the harm caused by cost sharing. The pandemic has significantly increased financial hardship among low-income families and families of color, making it less likely that they will be able to afford to pay additional cost sharing.Post-Enrollment Income VerificationThe IFR also permits states to modify their post-eligibility treatment of income (PETI) rules. This could leave enrollees with disabilities who are institutionalized or using a home and community-based services (HCBS) waiver program with less money to meet their basic needs, which could cause significant harm.For example, if states don't allow HCBS waiver enrollees to keep enough money each month to cover their living expenses, they may be forced into institutions. This prospect is particularly frightening during the pandemic, given the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on people in congregate settings.Coverage TiersCMS should abandon the coverage tiers system in the IFR. The IFR would allow states to move people from one eligibility category to another in certain circumstances, even when that would result in an individual receiving fewer benefits. This system violates the FFRCA, which requires preserving individuals' benefits, and can cause substantial harm. This harm will disproportionately fall on certain groups, including people with disabilities and older adults.We are also concerned that states will need to spend significant effort implementing these changes to their eligibility system. This effort would be far better spent doing other work, such as bolstering their ex parte renewal processes and updating addresses to better prepare for conducting redeterminations at the end of the public health emergency. Moreover, such massive changes to each states' eligibility system will likely generate errors.General Eligibility ExceptionsAdditionally, the IFR authorizes states to terminate coverage for individuals that should be protected under the FFRCA. This violates Congress' intent and should be rescinded.Valid EnrollmentUnder the IFR, CMS narrows the definition of ""valid enrollment"" to exclude some enrollees who should be considered properly enrolled and covered by the protections of the FFRCA.Determinations of IneligibilityThe IFR writes that ""if a state determines that a validly enrolled beneficiary is no longer eligible for Medicaid, including on a procedural basis"", the state meets the MOE requirements by ""continuing to provide the same Medicaid coverage that the beneficiary would have received absent the determination of ineligibility."" This language needs clarification or correction. We note two important considerations.First, we believe CMS should preserve the requirement that the MOE provision apply to procedural problems. For example, an individual who is delayed in responding to state outreach or requests for information may be dealing with serious health, economic or housing problems related to the COVID-19 crisis, and such procedural breakdowns cannot be an excuse to discontinue eligibility in violation of the FFCRA.Second, however, CMS must correct or clarify the use of the terms ""determines"" and ""determination"" in the regulation. No one protected by the MOE can be ""determined"" ineligible, as that would be contrary to the FFCRA's requirement that during the PHE these enrollees be ""treated as eligible"". We suggest CMS use a term such a ""nonactionable finding of ineligibility"" instead of ""determination of ineligibility.""Moreover, CMS should make clear that any such nonactionable finding of ineligibility during the public health emergency is not sufficient or even relevant to terminate someone at the end of the PHE. CMS should clarify that after the PHE ends, individuals must receive a full redetermination, based on current, point-in-time information (current income, household composition, etc.)./1Such a review must consider all bases of eligibility, and give enrollees at least 30 days to respond to a request for information (for those eligible using modified adjusted gross income)./2After the MOE ends and a full redetermination occurs, if an individual is found ineligible they are entitled to due process protections, such as a notice of termination that includes the effective date of the action and appeal rights./31332 Waiver ChangesUnder the IFR, CMS also proposes to allow the ""modification"" of public notice, comment, and hearing requirements for Section 1332 waiver requests pursuant to the Affordable Care Act, as well as post-award public hearings. These exceptions conflict with 1332 statutory requirements, and are overbroad and unnecessary.The IFR conflicts with the Affordable Care Act in that, through ""modification,"" they might allow the elimination of required transparency provisions. The IFR would also allow public notice and comment periods to be effectuated after the state files the application (in the case of state comment periods) or CMS conducts federal review (in the case of federal comment period). This will result in state proposals and CMS approvals that have no meaningful stakeholder input, violating the statute and congressional intent.In addition to being required by statute, the transparency process creates a minimal delay, in exchange for substantial benefit. As CMS has previously noted, the public notice and comment process on 1332 waivers ""promotes transparency, facilitates public involvement and input, and encourages sound decision-making at all levels of government""./4This process is essential to ensure that consumers have input into proposed waivers.Availability of COVID-19 VaccinesAs of December 8, 2020, more than 283,000 people in the United States have died as a result of COVID19, with almost 15 million confirmed cases. Public health experts agree that widespread use of a safe and effective preventive vaccine will be essential to curb this deadly pandemic.Although no COVID-19 vaccine had yet been approved in the U.S., Congress recognized the vital importance of coverage and access to COVID-19 vaccines when it enacted the FFCRA. Congress provided that state Medicaid programs receive enhanced federal funding if they cover approved COVID-19 vaccines, and provide access without cost sharing, during the period of the public health emergency.However, CMS is inexplicably seeking to limit access to COVID-19 vaccines, allowing states to exclude coverage of vaccinations for people enrolled in Medicaid limited benefit programs. These Medicaid limited benefit programs include programs focused on the treatment of breast and cervical cancer and tuberculosis, family planning programs, and some programs provided under Sec. 1115 waiver authority./5Further, CMS does not provide any explanation or analysis on how it would determine which of the existing 57 Sec. 1115 waiver programs would be subject to the IFR limits on vaccine coverage.The FFCRA makes no distinction between full and limited benefit Medicaid categories and specifically applies vaccination requirements to waiver programs. The obvious intent of the provision was to ensure widespread access to COViD-19 vaccination. CMS should not invent an ambiguity and then interpret it contrary to the statute's overriding intent. Congress is well familiar with limited scope benefits categories and would have carved out exceptions to FFRCA if it wanted to carve out such exceptions.Barring access to lifesaving COViD-19 vaccines would hamper efforts to combat the pandemic, and would harm tens of thousands of individuals who rely on Medicaid limited benefit programs. The IFR is inconsistent with the FFCRA statutory language and intent, relies on misreading of the Medicaid statute, and is harmful as a matter of health policy. It should be withdrawn.Use of an Interim Final RuleWe do not believe CMS should have implemented these policies - which directly and materially access to health care for tens of millions of enrollees during a pandemic - as an interim final rule. The Administrative Procedure Act anticipates that that government agencies will implement regulations only after receiving and considering public comment and that interim final rules will be used rarely and only of necessity -for example when a comment period would be ""contrary to the public interest."" There is no significant exigency associated with a notice and comment period for the policy contained in this IFR, whereas reducing health care eligibility, decreasing benefits, and increasing costs during a pandemic without an opportunity to comment will lead to immediate harms and is clearly contrary to the public interest. These policies will cause substantial harms before CMS has time to finalize the rule - harms that could have been avoided had CMS solicited public comments, like ours, before the rule went into effect.ConclusionThis is an unprecedented pandemic, and Congress took unprecedented measures under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to make sure Medicaid enrollees can access the services they need. The aforementioned provisions of the Interim Final Rule fly in the face of the law, and rip health care away from people at a time when health care is more important than ever. We strongly oppose these provisions of the Interim Final Rule, and urge HHS to withdraw them immediately.Finally, we have included citations and direct links to research and other materials. We request that the full text of material cited, along with the full text of our comment, be considered part of the formal administrative record for purposes of the Administrative Procedures Act. If HHS is not planning to consider these citations part of the record as we have requested here, we ask that you notify us and provide us an opportunity to submit copies of the studies into the record.Thank you for the opportunity to comment on this important issue.

This is a significant increase from the result announced yesterday, which covered 12/5/2021 to 12/18/2021, and is a further indication of the rate of spread of this variant.It should be noted that similar data reported from the CDC, updated this week, uses a statistical model to project the variant percentages for a more recent timeframe. This projection approach partly explains a higher percentage for the Omicron variant reported by CDC this week.Yesterday, 57 New Yorkers died due to COVID-19, bringing the total to 47,671. A geographic breakdown is as follows, by county of residence:All New York State mass vaccination sites are open to eligible New Yorkers aged 12 years and older for walk-in vaccination on a first-come, first-serve basis, with 10 sites open to eligible New Yorkers aged 5 and older. People who would prefer to schedule an appointment at a state-run mass vaccination site can do so on the Am I Eligible App or by calling 1-833-NYS-4-VAX. People may also contact their local health department, pharmacy, doctor or hospital to schedule appointments where vaccines are available, or visit vaccines.gov to find information on vaccine appointments near them.New Yorkers looking to schedule vaccine appointments for 5-11-year-old children are encouraged to contact their child's pediatrician, family physician, county health departments, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs), rural health centers, or pharmacies that may be administering the vaccine for this age group. Parents and guardians can visit vaccines.gov, text their ZIP code to 438829, or call 1-800-232-0233 to find nearby locations. Make sure that the provider offers the Pfizer-BioNTechCOVID-19 vaccine, as the other COVID-19 vaccines are not yet authorized for this age group.Visit our new website for parents and guardians for new information, frequently asked questions and answers, and resources specifically designed for parents and guardians of this age group.Yesterday, 22,035 New Yorkers received their first vaccine dose, and 11,425 completed their vaccine series. A geographic breakdown of New Yorkers who have been vaccinated by region is as follows:The COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker Dashboard is available to update New Yorkers on the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. The New York State Department of Health requires vaccinating facilities to report all COVID-19 vaccine administration data within 24 hours; the vaccine administration data on the dashboard is updated daily to reflect the most up-to-date metrics in the state's vaccination effort. New York State Department of Health-reported data from NYSIIS and CIR differs slightly from federally-reported data, which is inclusive of federally-administered doses and other minor differences. Both numbers are included in the release above.Table can be found here: https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/governor-hochul-updates-new-yorkers-states-progress-combating-covid-19-115MSTRUCK-7701803 MSTRUCK",N.Y.

22,"TULSA, Okla., Jan. 18, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- ONE Gas, Inc. (NYSE: OGS) today issued its financial guidance for 2022 and updated its five-year growth rates, narrowed its 2021 financial guidance range and announced a new goal for emissions reduction from its vintage pipeline replacement program.
""We are expanding our core business by capitalizing on the significant organic growth opportunities in our service territory,"" said Robert S. McAnnally, president and chief executive officer. ""Our focus on growth while reducing emissions leverages the unique opportunities presented by our assets to meet our customers' demand for affordable, reliable and renewable energy, now and into the future.""  
2022 FINANCIAL GUIDANCEONE Gas (the Company) expects 2022 net income to be in the range of $215 million to $227 million, with earnings per diluted share of $3.96 to $4.20. The midpoint of 2022 guidance is net income of $221 million and earnings per diluted share of $4.08.
The Company's 2022 earnings guidance includes the benefit of new rates and customer growth, offset by higher operating expenses, including depreciation expense from capital investments, and assumes normal weather.
Capital investments, including asset removal costs, are expected to be approximately $650 million in 2022, a 20% increase from 2021. Over 65% of these expenditures are targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. Capital investments for extensions to new customers are expected to be approximately $190 million, an increase of over 25% from 2021, primarily due to significant growth opportunities in Texas and Oklahoma. The anticipated average rate base for 2022 is $4.64 billion, calculated consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction.
As previously announced, the ONE Gas board of directors increased the first quarter dividend to $0.62 per share, resulting in an annualized dividend (subject to board of directors' approval) of $2.48 per share, an increase of 6.9% over 2021.
FIVE-YEAR FINANCIAL GROWTH RATESFor the five years ending 2026, capital investments, including asset removal costs, are expected to be in the range of $650 million to $750 million per year, or approximately $3.5 billion for the five-year period, an increase of 19% from the previous five-year plan. The increase in capital supports estimated average rate base growth of 8% to 9% per year through 2026, an increase from the prior five-year forecast of 7% to 8%.
While continuing to allocate more than 65% of total capital investments to system integrity and replacement projects, the Company anticipates strong growth, primarily in Texas and Oklahoma. Over the five-year period ending 2026, growth capital is estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion, an increase of 23% from the previous five-year plan.
Net income is expected to increase by an average of 8% to 10% annually through 2026, up from 6% to 8%, with diluted earnings per share now at 6% to 8%, up from 5% to 7%.
Operating costs over the five years are expected to increase on average approximately 4% per year.
ONE Gas estimates total net financing needs for the period 2022 through 2026 of approximately $1.6 billion, of which approximately 25% is expected to be equity.
The average annual dividend growth rate is expected to remain 6% to 8% through 2026, subject to board of directors' approval, with a target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 65% of net income.
2021 FINANCIAL GUIDANCEThe Company also narrowed its 2021 guidance to earnings of $3.83 to $3.87 per diluted share from the previous range of $3.80 to $3.90 per diluted share. Net income is now expected to be in the range of $206 million to $208 million. Capital investments are still expected to be $540 million.
NEW EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALONE Gas believes that natural gas assets will continue to play a pivotal role in ushering in a cleaner energy future and that it is uniquely positioned to deliver affordable, reliable and renewable energy to customers, now and into the future. The Company continues to lower methane emissions from its distribution operations through pipeline replacement, damage prevention and other operational practices. By 2035, ONE Gas expects to achieve a 55% reduction in emissions due to leaks from its distribution pipelines, measured from a 2005 baseline and accounting for projected system growth. The Company expects to achieve this goal primarily through its vintage pipeline replacement and protection program.
ONE Gas is pursuing other opportunities to lower net methane emissions, including transporting renewable natural gas (RNG) on its system. To date, the Company has executed eight letter agreements for biogas development projects that are expected to produce up to one billion cubic feet of RNG per year. Also, in its recent rate case, Oklahoma Natural Gas was authorized to spend $5 million annually to purchase RNG as part of its natural gas supply portfolio and recover the cost through its purchased gas-cost mechanism.

23,"SEATTLE, March 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Treehouse partners with youth in foster care throughout Washington state, providing access to childhood experiences and critical resources as they plan for their futures.
""When I walk outside, I am afraid to cough. 
""Ever since former President Donald Trump started referring to the COVID-19 pandemic as the 'Kung flu' and the 'China virus,' I have worried that, as an Asian American, people will see me through the lens of that xenophobic rhetoric.
""I am now scared to cough in public, because those fears are rooted in the hateful comments strangers have hurled at me in Seattle. Those words are painful. The fear of others, expressed through insults, fuels my own anxiety of walking city streets.
""My experience as a Chinese American woman is not unique. And, more and more, those racially motivated outbursts result in violence both nationwide, and in my own community.
""Recently, an 84-year-old man was pushed to the ground and killed in San Francisco. The Asian American senior citizen was attacked in broad daylight. In New York, a 52-year-old woman was pushed to the ground outside of a store in Queens – she had to get stitches in her forehead. In Oakland, a 91-year-old man landed face-first on the pavement after being shoved.
""These attacks were unprovoked. These people were just living their lives.
""In 2020, the New York City Police Department reported a 1,900-percent increase in hate crimes linked to anti-Asian American sentiment and Stop AAPI Hate reported 2,808 instances of discrimination between March and December 2020 nationwide. In King County, reported incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans had risen from 30 in 2018 to 25 in 2019 before jumping to 51 as of November of last year. 
""That's a staggering increase.
""The issue is clear: Racially motivated discrimination directed at Asian Americans is on the rise and we are seeing the impact of that increase in our community. In Seattle, Asian Americans make up the city's largest POC population. Asian American children make up 22 percent of the school population in Seattle, so an increase in violence aimed at this community has a direct impact on our youth. 
""As the CEO of Treehouse, it is my goal to bring people together. And, as a Chinese American woman, I am compelled to advocate for my community. This issue strikes at the center of my personal and professional lives. AAPI youth make up about 4 percent of the youth impacted by foster care that we serve through Treehouse and, as we work to better the lives of those who experience the foster care system, it is important we stay true to our values and support those in our community who are being mistreated simply because of the way they look. 
""The recent rise of xenophobia is a reminder of a painful past, a window into a time in our history when racism toward Asian Americans was rampant. When the Chinese Exclusion Act was signed into law it was used to excuse violence in the West, particularly in Washington. In the mid-1880s, Chinese residents in Seattle and Tacoma saw their businesses and homes burned while being forced to leave those cities.  
""Japanese Americans also faced discrimination when they were forced into internment camps. In fact, the anniversary of Executive Order 9066 – which allowed Japanese Americans to be relocated to those camps – was just last month. That order led to the incarceration of more than 12,000 Washingtonians. It is an important reminder of the pain caused by those camps. It shows the fragility of our civil liberties. It is up to all of us to speak out and reject injustice and bigotry. This is the only way to preserve freedoms for everyone – especially those furthest from socio-economic, educational and racial justice. 
""This spike of violence and hatred towards Asian Americans – particularly vulnerable elders – is jarring, a signal there is still so much to be done to make our country a more inclusive and just place for everyone. This includes rejecting the 'model minority stereotype' created by opponents during the civil rights era who wanted to derail progress toward racial justice. This false narrative perpetuates the myth that Asian Americans are more successful than other people of color, because of their hard work, education and 'inherent law-abiding natures,' which negates our struggles and experiences with discrimination. It also contributes to the under-reporting and under-investigation of hate crimes, discrimination and bias-based incidents. 
""The pandemic has been difficult. COVID-19 has ravaged our communities – particularly the BIPOC and Latinx communities – and nation. People across the country have lost jobs and loved ones. Because of xenophobic vitriol and rhetoric in our national discourse, it has also fueled fear and stoked racial tension. 
""We must call attention to this violence and denounce all instances of hate. It is time for Americans to move beyond the xenophobic rhetoric and begin lifting each other up as we celebrate everything that makes us unique. 
""In addition to the slurs and violence that is on the rise in our streets, Asian American businesses are struggling more than most because, in addition to having fewer potential customers, some are boycotting these businesses due to false information about COVID-19. We can show solidarity through our patronage (to find Asian American and other BIPOC-owned businesses in your community, check out intentionalist.com). We can also support our neighbors by interrupting harassment and bigotry when we see it – because silence is also a statement.
""We must work to bring people together. Our future depends on it. We can do our part to treat each other with compassion. It is our obligations as citizens of Earth to treat each other with compassion and respect. This is a difficult moment for Asian Americans. We must not allow stereotypes and bias to further fray the fabric of our community. We value diversity, equity and inclusion and want to live in a world where we lift each other up instead of tear each other down. 
""Creating a future where equity and inclusion is the expectation starts today. We must set an example for our children to create a colorful world where all people from all communities can thrive and prosper. 
""One day, I will walk down the street without that fear that a cough might invite hate-filled comments. One day, my parents and other elderly Asian Americans will go on their daily walks without fear of being shoved to the ground. One day, the youth we serve at Treehouse will live in a more equitable society.""

Dr. Lisa Chin, CEO of Treehouse

24,"HOUSTON — The Red Sox season appeared to be an unqualified success back on Oct. 5 when they beat the Yankees in the Wild Card Game.They overcame low expectations, injuries, and a team-wide COVID-19 outbreak in August to make the playoffs on the final day of the regular season, then beat their rivals at Fenway Park.That's a season to be proud of and one well ahead of schedule after finishing last in 2020.But having a nice pile of house money doesn't mean you want to throw it away. The Sox beat the 100-win Tampa Bay Rays in the Division Series then took two of the first three games of the ALCS against the Houston Astros with the next two games coming up at home.Being two wins away from the World Series is a qualifier, a big giant one you can't pretend doesn't exist. It's not easy to get to that point even under the best of circumstances. Just ask the Rays or the San Francisco Giants.Such opportunities are precious, and the Red Sox wasted it. Their season came to an end Friday with a 5-0 loss against the Astros and if you're looking for hosannas, you're in the wrong place.The Red Sox scored one run on nine hits in the last 26 innings of the series and were 0 for 17 with runners in scoring position. They were thoroughly outplayed by the Astros with the pennant at stake.The Sox didn't score in the final 11 innings of the season. This from a team that finished fourth in the American League with 5.12 runs per game.With their season on the line, the Sox had two hits.Or you can look at this way: The Sox had 10 hits in the last three games, one fewer than Houston designated hitter Yordan Alvarez, the series Most Valuable Player. Cora was 17-5 in the postseason through Game 3 and the Red Sox had not lost two playoff games in a row under his watch. Now he's 17-8.Cora Magic had an expiration date. He stayed too long with Chris Sale in Game 5 and on Friday kept slumping Hunter Renfroe in right field at a time his struggling lineup needed something different.Renfroe rewarded his manager with a popup to second and a strikeout before he was pinch-hit for in the eighth inning. Renfroe finished 1 for 16 in the series with eight strikeouts.Cora also tried a hit-and-run with runners on first and third and one out in the seventh inning against Kendall Graveman. Travis Shaw struck out and Alex Verdugo was thrown out at second base.It was the end of the inning and essentially the end of the season.“I just bet on my players,"" Cora said. “A 3-2 count. We put the ball in play against a sinker-baller, we score one.""Maybe it was worth the risk to change the tenor of the game. But Verdugo had only six stolen bases all season and Houston catcher Martín Maldonado threw out 40 percent of base stealers, the third-best rate in the game.In the end, Houston had the managerial advantage with Dusty Baker. The Astros roasted the Sox by an aggregate 23-3 over the final three games.The Sox seemed to have every advantage on the pitching side after Game 3. But Baker and his pitching coach, Brent Strom, flipped that. The Astros cobbled together Game 4 then rode strong starts by Framber Valdez and Luis Garcia to the Series.“They changed their script, and we knew it,"" Cora said.The Sox wasted good pitching on Friday. Nate Eovaldi allowed one run over 4⅓ innings and deserved better than being tagged with the loss.Up 1-0, the Astros put runners on second and third with no outs. Eovaldi struck out Carlos Correa (slider), Kyle Tucker (curveball) and Chas McCormick (cutter) to end the threat.That would have inspired a lot of teams. The Sox went in order the next inning with two strikeouts.Credit to Garcia, who was magnificent after leaving Game 2 with what was said to be a sore right knee. He allowed one hit over 5⅔ innings.The Sox never figured him out. There was a lot of that going around.“We had bigger goals, but to be honest with you, I'm very proud of the group,"" Cora said after addressing his players.He should be proud. In time this season will be remembered as a precursor to something better. But for now it's defined by letting a spot in the World Series slip away without much of a fight.Peter Abraham can be reached at peter.abraham@globe.com.

Thousands of New York healthcare workers are in limbo as a federal judge considers whether the state's vaccination mandate must accommodate requests for religious exemptions, in a case that could guide similar policies in other states.
As written, New York's vaccine mandate applies to all people who work in hospitals and nursing homes, and it doesn't allow healthcare employees to opt out with weekly testing. There were provisions for medical exemptions but not exemptions based on religious beliefs.
Thousands of healthcare workers who refused vaccinations lost their jobs around the state when the mandate took effect, prompting hospitals to cancel elective surgeries and close operating rooms and outpatient clinics. Many nursing homes have stopped admitting new patients.
Workers filed several lawsuits last month to challenge the mandate before it took effect. Seventeen healthcare workers represented by the Thomas More Society, a legal group that advocates for religious liberty, said being forced to take the vaccine would violate their religious beliefs.
On Sept. 14, U.S. District Judge David Hurd in Utica, N.Y., issued a restraining order, preventing the state from sanctioning a facility that honored religious-exemption requests. Judge Hurd said he would rule on whether to convert the temporary restraining order to an injunction by next Tuesday.
Several healthcare workers who sought religious exemptions from the vaccine mandate said they were Christians who believed their body was sacred and that they avoid medicinal interventions. Others, including the plaintiffs in the Utica case, said they were Christians who opposed abortion and wouldn't take available Covid-19 vaccines because they were developed using fetal tissue.
Cell lines derived from fetal tissue that was aborted -- often decades ago -- are routinely used in medical research, including the development and production of the Covid-19 vaccines available in the U.S. Fetal cell lines have also played a role in the development of vaccines against diseases including polio, chickenpox, hepatitis A and shingles.
A spokesman for New York's Roman Catholic bishops said the Vatican has determined that in the absence of ethically irreproachable Covid-19 vaccines, it is morally acceptable to receive existing Covid-19 vaccines. The spokesman noted that Pope Francis has stated, ""I believe that morally everyone must take the vaccine.""
The judge's order didn't constrain specific employers, and hospital systems have since taken different approaches. Some have fired people who sought a religious exemption, while others have kept them on the payroll, often with additional testing requirements.
The state Health Department said Wednesday that 7,019 hospital workers and 2,934 nursing-home workers applied for nonmedical exemptions to the mandate. A spokeswoman declined to comment further, citing the pending litigation.
A similar lawsuit in Rhode Island, which also doesn't allow religious exemptions to its vaccine mandate, is also pending. On Sept. 30, U.S. District Judge Mary McElroy denied a request from several healthcare workers to bar the state's health department from forcing employers to deny religious exemptions.
New York's mandate applies to more than 665,000 employees of hospitals and nursing homes. When it took effect on Sept. 27, 92% of staff in those facilities were vaccinated -- and state data show vaccination rates among affected workers rose faster than the general population since the mandate was announced in August.
Christopher Ferrara, an attorney with the Thomas More Society, said the state would violate the First Amendment right to religious expression if it allowed for a medical exemption, which he described as secular, without offering a comparable religious exemption. He cited an April 2021 Supreme Court ruling that temporarily barred pandemic-related restrictions on the size of at-home religious gatherings in California.
Katherine Franke, a professor at Columbia Law School, said that the California case is one of several recent Supreme Court rulings that expand protections for religious liberty, and she expects cases rising up from state vaccine mandates could set a national precedent.
Lawyers for the state argued the mandate was consistent with longstanding vaccination requirements for health workers that don't allow for religious exemptions. Vaccination is a critical tool used to fight the pandemic, and federal courts have upheld vaccination requirements since 1905 as necessary to promote public health, they said.
New York Gov. Kathy Hochul has held firm on the mandate, and said Tuesday that employees of state facilities for the mentally ill and developmentally disabled will face a similar requirement.

LONDON -- Royal Dutch Shell PLC said it would start reducing oil production, calling an end to a decades-old strategy centered on pumping more hydrocarbons as it and other energy companies seek to capitalize on a shift to low-carbon power.
The move marks a historic shift for the company, which after starting out importing seashells began selling kerosene in the 19th century and had sought to grow its oil business ever since. Until recent years, it pursued expensive, environmentally challenging projects in Canadian oil sands and Alaska, driven by fears the world could run out of oil. Now, it sees demand faltering long before oil runs out.
Shell said Thursday its oil production had peaked and it expects output to decline 1% to 2% a year, including from asset sales, reducing its exposure to commodity prices over the longer term. The company plans to cut its production of traditional fuels such as diesel and gasoline by 55% in the next decade. At the same time, the company said it would double the amount of electricity it sells and roll out thousands of new electric-vehicle charging points.
The strategy follows similar plans from BP PLC and Total SE to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels while expanding in renewable power such as wind and solar, partly in response to growth in regulatory and investor pressure.
U.S. companies Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. don't plan to invest substantially in electricity and both say the world will need vast amounts of fossil fuels for decades to come. Exxon does, though, plan to invest in technology to reduce carbon emissions.
However, the pivot to low-carbon energy is seen by analysts as challenging because it requires investments in areas where major oil companies don't necessarily have a competitive advantage and that have lower returns. Renewable-energy projects typically generate returns of around 10%, compared with the traditional 15% targeted on oil-and-gas projects.
As such, major oil companies' green ambitions have so far failed to ignite enthusiasm among investors, at a time when the energy industry is grappling with the fallout from the pandemic, which prompted BP and Shell to cut their dividends.
The share prices of Europe's three largest oil companies have fallen dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic sapped demand and sent oil prices lower, with Shell down 35% over the past year, BP 45% lower and Total down 24%. Shell shares fell 2.7% on Thursday.
Shell sought to allay any concerns about its new strategy Thursday, saying fossil-fuel production would remain a material source of revenue into the 2030s, while reiterating its policy to increase its dividend by 4% each year.
""By accessing the enormous opportunities that the future of energy holds we will create the conditions for future share price appreciation,"" said Chief Executive Officer Ben van Beurden. ""We expect to radically transform Shell over the next 30 years.""
Unlike BP and Total, Shell didn't give targets for adding renewable energy production capacity. The company said it didn't necessarily need to own generation capacity to sell more power, and that it thought it could make more money focusing on areas like trading and selling the electricity.
Shell confirmed that from now it would allocate around 25% of its spending, or $5 billion to $6 billion, to renewable energy and marketing -- which includes its gas stations and lubricants business -- up from 11% previously.
The company aims to sell 560 terawatt hours of electricity a year by 2030, double its current sales, but stopped short of setting targets for power generation. Shell sells much more power than it produces. This is similar to its oil-and-gas business, where Shell sells around three times as much of the fuels as it produces.
In recent years, Shell has expanded outside of oil and gas with acquisitions of businesses including U.K. power supplier First Utility, electric-vehicle charging company Ubitricity and battery firm Sonnen.
At the same time, the company plans to invest $8 billion a year on oil-and-gas production, seeking particularly high-value projects, and an additional $4 billion a year on its so called integrated-gas business, which includes liquefied-natural gas. Shell will add seven million metric tons of LNG production capacity by the mid-2020s, including from projects already sanctioned in Canada and Nigeria.
European energy companies' plans to invest more in low-carbon power come at a time when they are still trying to reduce debt. Shell wants to cut its debt to $65 billion from $75.4 billion at the end of last year and targets annual asset sales of $4 billion to help meet its goal.

Opening UBS Arena will be one of the most significant moments in franchise history. But, strictly in hockey terms, the struggling Islanders are hoping their new, $1.1 billion home helps them improve their game. 
The last-place Islanders (5-6-2) face the Flames on Saturday night, having lost four straight in regulation to end a 13-game road trip. They allowed at least four goals in each of those defeats, the longest such streak since Barry Trotz became coach. 
Plus, captain Anders Lee, Josh Bailey and Ross Johnston are all in COVID-19 protocol. 
""Hopefully, it gives us some energy right now,"" Trotz said of opening UBS Arena after Tuesday night's 6-1 loss to the Panthers. ""I don't think you can go in our room and anybody feels really great about anything other than we got this road trip done. I'm hoping it'll re-energize us and, hopefully, get our game in order."" 
Saturday opens a four-game homestand for the Islanders - the Maple Leafs and ex-captain John Tavares are in town on Sunday night - and 14 of their next 20 are at UBS Arena. 
""We're going to be so excited,"" Mathew Barzal said. ""I think it's all going to be channeled into our play and into our game. As a group, we're excited to get in front of our fans after playing on the road for so long. It feels like we're going to channel it in the right direction."" 
""It's going to be exciting, there's no doubt about it,"" Casey Cizikas said. ""We're excited to get back in front of our fans. We're excited to get back on home ice. We're looking forward to this right now."" 
UBS Arena will seat 17,250 for hockey, a little over 3,300 more than antiquated Nassau Coliseum. The Islanders also played at Barclays Center in Brooklyn from 2015-2020. 
""The Coliseum served us well,"" Trotz said. ""Barclays has served us well. The guys that have been part of this team the last four or five years, they built this. We've been a competitive team the last couple of years and we've got to continue to be a competitive team."" 
Trotz noted the first few games at UBS Arena may feel like neutral-site games since neither team will be overly familiar with the surroundings. The Islanders practiced there on Thursday but are still learning all the ins-and-outs of their new home. 
Brock Nelson, asked what he was anticipating the most at UBS Arena, said, ""Probably just the whole thing."" 
""It's been a long time coming for the franchise and the fan base."" 
Notes & quotes: The Islanders' pregame show on MSG Plus for Saturday's UBS Arena opener will be expanded to one hour and include interviews with co-owner Jon Ledecky as well as Stanley Cup alumni Denis Potvin, Ken Morrow, Bobby Nystrom and John Tonelli ...The Empire State Building will be lit in blue and orange on Saturday night to commemorate the arena's first hockey game ...The Islanders unveiled a 2021-22 season inaugural jersey patch to mark their first season at UBS Arena.

32,"""The pandemic has been all hands on deck for us. ... We have significantly increased our workforce.""
Matthew Sause
Roche Diagnostics
president and CEO
While the COVID-19 pandemic has been devastating for many companies, some actually have flourished over the past year.Roche Diagnostics, with its years of experience in manufacturing medical tests, was in perfect position to be a winner. Roche has and continues to develop tests to help detect COVID-19 infections.When the pandemic began, the company, whose North American headquarters sits on a sprawling campus along I-69 in Indianapolis, quickly developed a test for the new virus. More than a year ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted an emergency use authorization for it the same day President Donald Trump declared a national emergency.
Unlike other tests that took hours to complete, the Roche version could be run in about three-and-a-half hours.
""We got that test out to patients as quickly as we could,"" said Matthew Sause, Roche Diagnostics president and CEO, in a recent IndyStar interview. ""The pandemic has been all hands on deck for us. ... We have significantly increased our workforce.""
Globally, Roche has created more than 1,000 jobs to help increase manufacturing capacity for its molecular tests for a range of conditions from COVID-19 to sexual transmitted diseases, company officials said.
Before the pandemic, Roche's Indianapolis campus had about 3,000 employees working on-site with another 1,500 off-site reporting to the office.
During the pandemic, Roche hired about 200 people who provide customer support in the field, such as the engineers who install the instruments on which the Roche COVID-19 tests are run, company officials said. Roche also hired additional staff to assist with supply chain efforts.
At the start of the pandemic, only about 500 essential workers continued to come to the campus, mostly in the areas of supply chain and manufacturing. Now, that number has risen to 900.
Different COVID-19 tests
Since its first test was approved, Roche has continued to work on developing additional COVID-related tests, Sause said. In addition to a test for COVID antibodies to determine if a person has been infected in the past, Roche also introduced a single test that can look for both COVID and influenza.
""We perceive in the future that when flu season conflates with what we believe will be endemic circulation of SARS CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID), you will need to differentiate,"" Sause said. ""There is a significant sense that in the future SARS CoV-2 will become an endemic disease and it will circulate like a respiratory virus in the flu season.""
Now, the company is working on developing a rapid antigen test for COVID-19 and has started to explore the possibility of an at-home COVID-19 test.
The pandemic has spurred interest in at-home medical testing in general, as lockdowns led to many telehealth visits, which make it difficult to perform what was once routine testing, Sause said.
""The move to more at-home testing has really been a function of the pandemic,"" he said. ""I do think you see testing moving closer to the patient.""
Roche employees themselves have been the beneficiary of that change. If they suspect that they might be infected with COVID-19, they have been able to take a self-administered at-home test, which they can then send to the lab for results.
The company has also been running a vaccine clinic on campus, encouraging but not requiring its employees to get vaccinated.
New avenues for testing
At the same time as the pandemic opened new avenues for Roche, they saw their routine business decline with lockdowns that put certain types of medical check-up tests temporarily on the back burner for most.
The volume for such testing, however, has now slowly increased to about pre-pandemic levels, Sause said.
""What that means is that patients are getting out and getting routine care again,"" Sause said. ""Health care that people rely on is being delivered.""
Roche did not put its other projects on hold over the past year. The company received approval for a test that can help diagnose whether solid organ transplant recipients experience life-threatening complications after their transplant. Another test can assist in predicting a woman's risk of developing cervical cancer.
The company has also submitted a request for FDA approval for a test for pre-eclampsia, a condition that can go undiagnosed in pregnant women. If approved, the blood test would become the first test used specifically for that condition.
Looking to the future
Since last May, the majority of the Indianapolis nonessential staff have been working remotely. Like other executives at companies, Sause and colleagues are contemplating when the time will be right for a full-fledged return to the office.
Even before the pandemic hit, Roche had prided itself on creating a new office culture that allowed for collaboration and flexibility in a space designed to emphasize natural light and inspire innovation.
But the past year has taught new work practices that Sause said he hopes the company maintains in the transition, such as stand-up meetings and fewer all-day leadership gatherings.
At this point, he said, it's not even clear if the future will hold everyone working full time on campus. Roche officials are trying to ensure a balance between the flexibility that working from home affords and the ability to collaborate in person.
""I think we will see how this goes forward,"" Sause said. ""One thing this pandemic has shown us, there's a lot of unpredictability.""

Hanoi Medical College is one the top university with campus in central Vietnam. It is the oldest medical college of Vietnam. GURUGRAM, India, Nov. 16, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Popularity of Vietnam Medical Education Market: With а рорulаtiоn оf 96.4 million during 2020, it makes Vietnаm third mоst рорulоus соuntry in Sоuth Eаst Asia.  Along with the rapid eсоnоmiс  develорment,  the  heаlth  stаtus  оf  рeорle  in  Vietnаm  hаs  signifiсаntly  imрrоved  in  reсent  yeаrs,  with  the  life  exрeсtаnсy  аt  birth  inсreаsing  frоm  71  yeаrs  in  1990  tо  76  yeаrs  in  2015.  In the past two decades (2001 – 2020), medical education system has gradually moved towards an integrated educational program, applying the principle of ""student-centeredness"", and introducing educational methods ""based on problems"". And ""based on simulation"". The need for additional doctors to the local health system has been addressed, helping to improve access to medical education for ethnic minorities and people in rural areas.
Enablers of Medical Education in Vietnam: In recent years, medical education in Vietnam has undergone changes with the support of international donors. For example, the ''Strengthening Medical Skills Training at Eight Universities'' project supported by the Netherlands' NUFFIC program from 2004 to 2008, in establishing and developing medical skills training units and new medical skills training curricula. The Dutch government also supported another project aimed at strengthening community-oriented education. As a step forward, medical schools in Vietnam have led changes in their education models through Health Professionals Education and Training for Health System Reforms project (HPET), approved by the Vietnamese government in late 2013. With coming ages there will be a lot of growth in the Vietnamese educational sector with the support of these efforts.
Specialized Courses in Vietnam: Vietnam, being a colonial country in the past follows traditional French system of education. The traditional methods involve learning by practice. This involves learning by practice through residency programs.
Students can go for the residency programs straight after their medical graduation, all they need is accreditation from the Department of Health. Approximately, 10% of medical students go for their residency program. Other methods of acquiring the medical specialization have to go through the Specialization level 1 and level 2 degree programs.
The report titled ""Landscape of Vietnam Medical Education Market- Outcome Based Curriculum with Clear Explicit Articulations that Medical Graduates should Demonstrate"" by Ken Research suggested that the Colleges have faced a slight downfall in terms of No. of Intake, Enrollment and Graduates amid COVID-19. Major merits of pursuing medicine in Vietnam Universities are factors such is high salaries, cheap cost of living, free style education and high opportunities.

U.S. health regulators said they need more time to decide whether to authorize the Covid-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE for children under 5 years, after the drugmakers notified them of additional data from a continuing study.
The Food and Drug Administration said Friday that it was delaying a decision to consider data from testing under way evaluating a third dose of the vaccine, not just the first two.
The agency didn't specify the additional data that it had received and had prompted its action, but it said it made the move to include data on the third dose in an authorization decision.
""The data that we saw made us realize that we needed to see data from a third dose in the ongoing trial in order to make a determination that we could proceed with doing an authorization,"" said Peter Marks, who directs the FDA's vaccines division.
The FDA had been considering a request by the companies to clear the use of two doses of the vaccine. The agency was then going to look at expanding the authorization to a third dose, should the study show it works safely.
The new move will delay the rollout of the shot for children younger than 5, the last age group without access to vaccination.
Pfizer and BioNTech said they expect results on whether three doses of the vaccine works safely in early April. Researchers are collecting more data, including from more children in the study who have become infected as more time has passed.
Dr. Marks said some of these new Covid-19 cases in the study were subjects infected with the Omicron variant. He said the FDA decided to seek more time because the data from additional infected study subjects was coming in rapidly. Including data from more infected study participants, he said, might enable the FDA to assess the efficacy of the vaccine, rather than simply look to see whether immune responses generated by the shot are comparable to those seen in older people. The FDA was going to make its decision by looking at the immune response.
The announcements came on the day that the FDA was expected to release a staff review of the application for use in young children. Instead, the agency didn't release a report and postponed a meeting, scheduled for next week, of vaccine experts who advise the agency on regulatory requests.
Some health experts have urged the FDA to hold off on authorization because the testing so far didn't find that the vaccine produced a strong immune response in 2- to 4-year-olds, but only in children under 2. The critics say the agency should wait for results of testing a third, or booster, dose to see if that generates a sufficient immune response.
Pfizer and BioNTech were going to wait for results from testing a booster dose before seeking FDA authorization in children under age 5. Yet the FDA urged Pfizer and BioNTech to seek clearance, rather than wait for the booster data.
Before the latest move, the government had been making plans to begin distributing the shots. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had told local health officials they should be ready to receive shipments by Feb. 21.
Rollout of the first two doses for young children would have accelerated their access to a booster, if that third dose were found to work safely and authorized, The Wall Street Journal reported.
Yet some vaccine experts said the FDA would face a thorny decision -- and risk undermining its reputation for making decisions based on scientific evidence -- if testing didn't show the booster works.
The FDA also could find itself in the difficult position, the experts said, of having cleared for use a vaccine that wasn't found to work in some of the people the agency authorized it for. The FDA says it only clears medicines that research shows are safe and effective.
Each dose for the younger children is one-tenth the dose given to older children and adults.
Dr. Marks expressed hope that the delay would show parents the agency is conducting a thorough review. ""I hope this reassures people that the process has a standard, that the process is one that we follow,"" he said.
In the study evaluating the vaccine in young children, the first two doses didn't provide the kind of immune response researchers say is needed to protect against symptomatic Covid-19 in children 2 to 5 years.
Some outside researchers have said children have less mature antibody responses than adults, so they might need an extra dose to get the desired immune response. The companies have declined to speculate.
The vaccine did generate a sufficiently strong immune response in children under 2 years.
The companies said they hadn't observed any serious safety concerns in testing.
Approximately 19 million children in the U.S. are under 5 years. Some parents are eager to vaccinate their children -- a group that was hospitalized in larger numbers during the recent Omicron surge than previously in the pandemic. Many of the hospitalized children had underlying health conditions or were admitted for non-Covid-19 reasons, but also tested positive for the virus, according to research and the government.
Pediatricians and health authorities already faced an uphill climb in vaccinating the youngsters before the FDA faced questions whether it would authorize a shot that wasn't found to work in 2- to 5-year-olds.
Some 31% of parents of children under 5 years surveyed said they would get their child vaccinated immediately; 12% said they would vaccinate their children only if required to do so, 29% said they would wait, and 26% said they wouldn't seek the vaccine at all, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey.

43,"CHICAGO , June 17, 2021  /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- Rev. Jesse L. Jackson, Sr. is holding a press conference 10 a.m. (PT), 12 noon (CT), Friday, June 18th, at the Hilton Hotel, San Francisco Financial District, 750 Kearney St. San Francisco, to welcome President Biden's efforts to send vaccines overseas and to urge the Biden administration to expedite vaccines to India.
""We thank President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for leading the call for more vaccine doses to be sent abroad,"" said Rev. Jackson.
Rev. Jackson and Indian leaders including Dr. Vijay G. Prabhakar, Rainbow PUSH Coalition Global Ambassador and chairman of the American Association of Multi Ethnic Physicians, USA, thanked President Biden for pledging to send 2 million doses of vaccines to India of the 6 million he promised to send abroad.
""We thanked Rev. Jackson for making a personal appeal on our behalf to President Biden for more vaccines when he was in Tulsa, Oklahoma,"" said Dr. Prabhakar. ""We thank Rev. Jackson for appealing to President Biden to remove the Defense Production Act ratings on three U.S. vaccine manufacturers which would ease the supply of raw materials to vaccine manufacturers in India.""
Dr. Prabhakar also thanked Rev. Jackson for advocating for vaccine intellectual property waivers.
The call by Rev. Jackson and Indian leaders comes at a time when there have been 1.2 million Indians who have died of the Coronavirus, according to Dr. Bhrhmar Mukherjee, professor of Public Health and Epidemiology at the University of Michigan. That figure is of May 15th. ""More doses are needed,"" said Rev. Jackson.
Agreeing, Sathya Padmanabhan, a 16-year-old junior at the Basis Chandler High School in Chandler, Arizona, and the World Federation of Tamil Youth's USA Student Wing Secretary also made an appeal for more doses for India. With more than 33,498,468 COVID-19 cases in India, Padmanabhan, who is also founder of BRILLIANAIRE, a non-profit organization, asked Biden to send at least 10 million more doses to India.
Neil Khot, national chair of Indian American Business Coalition, USA, said the U.S. and India have both been tested during this pandemic, and we are heartened to see the U.S. and the diaspora's robust response to support India during its dire COVID-19 second wave.
""As strong proponents of a close U.S.-India relationship, we are hopeful that the Biden-Harris administration will continue to assist India during its time of need. As Vice President Harris has stated, the diaspora will continue to serve as a bridge between our two countries,"" said Khot.
M. Rangaswami, founder/chairman of Indiaspora, a non-profit network of global Indian origin leaders and Co founder of. Sand Hill Group, Silicon Valley, thanked Rev. Jackson for his ""relentless efforts to aid India and for hosting this press conference during his current visit to San Francisco to affirm African American and Asian American/Pacific Islander solidarity.""
""There is no doubt our diverse communities are stronger when we stand together,"" said Rangaswami who has helped to raise $6 million for India's COVID relief through different initiatives including Indiaspora's Chalo Give India campaign.
While thanking Biden for promising to send 2 million doses of the vaccine to India, Rangaswami said the situation still remains dire.
He said by sending vaccines through COVAX as well as coming directly to the aid of India by sending vaccine raw materials and advocating for vaccine intellectual property waivers, ""our world as a whole is a better place. We are all in this together and as long as India is not vaccinated, our work is not done,"" said Rangaswami.
Dr. Twin Green, Ambassador, Citizens action Alliance For Behavioral Health, USA & CEO, The Link & Option Center, South Holland, Illinois, offered Telepsychiatry services through EnSoftek's DrCloudEHR Whole Person Care solution to rural America and India to combat the challenges of the mental health crisis during the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Leveraging digital technology to meet the overburdened mental health providers is the need of the hour,"" Dr. Green said.

When polled in April, 42% of consumers said they already felt comfortable traveling, and 12% said they would feel comfortable traveling when vaccines were widely available to everyone in the U.S.  “It’s clear consumers have a strong desire to travel again as we head into the summer months and the economic recovery continues,” said Jacob Ayoub, vice president of consumer and competitive insights at Discover. “We know travel trends and consumer needs are going to continue to shift, but it’s important to note that right now U.S. consumers are considering costs, flexibility, and the spread of COVID-19 while traveling.”  Health and safety top of mind for travelers  Eighty percent of consumers say it’s important to find travel accommodations with strict COVID-19 hygiene protocols – and it appears this trend isn’t going away.  In the next six months, 74% of consumers reported they will continue to prioritize the cleanliness rating of their accommodation when deciding where to stay. Consumers also said they’re more likely to splurge on pricey accommodations and travel options if it means they have strict COVID-19 hygiene protocols, 50%, and consumers also say they are more likely to invest in priority travel passes to avoid crowds, 49%.  When it comes to wearing masks, nearly two in three consumers say they will continue to wear them while traveling, even after it’s no longer required. Of those wearing masks, 39% say they’ll continue to wear them in public spaces, like a hotel or resort, and 36% say they will wear masks when at a transportation hub, such as an airport or bus station.  Consumers favor cost-effective methods of travel that allow more control   When deciding where to vacation, consumers report the cost of their destination, 87%, and the flexibility of cancellation policies, 86%, are the most important factors, outranking the spread of COVID-19 variants, 80%, and the number of positive COVID-19 cases, 80%, in a destination area.  Sixty-two percent of consumers say they are hesitant to take modes of transportation where they have to be near others. Over half of U.S. consumers are planning to drive to their next destination, with just 39% reporting they’ll fly. Most consumers report plans to take a road trip in the next six months, 29%, followed by a beach vacation, 21%.  For six in 10 respondents, these trips may be closer to home as consumers say they’re more likely to travel locally than take large trips across the country.  Credit cards are the preferred payment method   Fifty-five percent of consumers cite credit cards as their preferred method of payment while on vacation – a 16 percentage point increase from Discover’s 2019 travel survey.  Additionally, given the pandemic’s impact on travel and the need to avoid touching as many surfaces as possible, 56% of consumers say they will leverage contactless payments more frequently while traveling.  With credit card points and rewards stacking up the past year, about one-third of consumers say they’re planning to redeem their rewards for vacation-related expenses.  “The flexibility of the Discover it® Miles card gives our cardmembers the ability to travel without being tied to specific brands or booking portals and based on their comfort level, whether that’s flying to their next destination or driving to a nearby getaway,” said Ayoub. “With rewards that can be redeemed as a statement credit for travel purchases, used toward paying off a bill or deposited directly into a bank account, cardmembers can redeem their Miles in ways that work for them.”1  About the Survey  All figures, unless otherwise stated, are from a Dynata (formerly Research Now/SSI) survey conducted on behalf of Discover Financial Services.

49," Acquisition Positions the Platform as One of the Largest Fintechs in the LatAm Region  Alejandro Berman  Head of Marketing & PR  +52 1 55 43 77 09 24  aberman@credijusto.com  Credijusto, the leading technology-enabled lending platform in Mexico, announced today the acquisition of Banco Finterra, a Mexico City-based bank that specializes in financing solutions for small businesses and the agriculture sector. Credijusto is the first Mexican fintech to acquire a regulated bank, becoming the only neobank in Latin America focused on serving small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).  The company’s expansion reflects a global trend of fintech firms acquiring regulated banks to enable more diversified product offerings. The acquisition doubles the size of its business and quickly accelerates Credijusto’s growth. Over the past year, Mexico has seen strong demand for technology-enabled lending solutions as COVID-19 created heightened need for credit and traditional banks have struggled to adapt to the new digital reality. With the addition of Banco Finterra, the company is positioned to become the largest financial services provider to small businesses in Mexico as well as the leader in cross-border banking solutions between the U.S. and Mexico. As the largest trading partner to the U.S., Mexico is an increasingly important economic and strategic ally.  “Our acquisition of Banco Finterra creates the first truly digital banking platform for Mexican SMEs,” said Allan Apoj, Co-CEO of Credijusto. “This acquisition marks a major milestone in Mexico and the region, and we are proud to be revolutionizing the future of banking in Latin America.”  The combined businesses have lent over $2 billion to underserved SMEs, while Credijusto has raised more than $400 million in equity and debt from a leading group of global investors including Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Point72 Ventures, New Residential Investment Corp., Kaszek, QED Investors and John Mack. In a market where banks are slow to innovate and focused on corporate clients, Credijusto, which was founded in 2015, has developed a multi-product offering using a combination of cutting-edge software design, innovative applications of data science, and advanced internal processes. The company’s better-priced products, faster delivery and superior customer experience help to address financial inclusion and a $164 billion SME financing gap in the Mexican market.  “By combining our proprietary software and data science expertise with Finterra’s banking capabilities, we are building a next generation financial services business,” said David Poritz, Co-CEO of Credijusto. “Our acquisition will also enable a digital cross-border experience to the thousands of businesses engaged in commerce between the U.S. and Mexico, an opportunity that we see as a major driver of growth for Credijusto.”  Mark McCoy, CEO of Banco Finterra, said: “We are very excited for this next phase of the bank and the benefits to come for Mexican businesses, leveraging Credijusto's technology, agility and service.”  With 6 million SMEs in Mexico, which generate over 50 percent of the country’s GDP and employ over 70 percent of the active workforce, Credijusto will continue to play a crucial role in the growth of Mexico’s economy.  About Credijusto  Founded in 2015, Credijusto is a financial technology company focused on lending to the underserved and rapidly growing small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) market in Mexico — via products that are superior in price, speed of delivery and quality of customer experience. The company uses a combination of cutting-edge software design, innovative applications of data science and advanced internal processes for decision making and product structuring. Credijusto is backed by a world-class group of institutional investors, including Goldman Sachs, Credit Suisse, Point72 Ventures, New Residential Investment Corp., Kaszek, QED Investors and John Mack.  About Banco Finterra   Banco Finterra is a regulated bank based in Mexico City and known for its comprehensive services for the agricultural sector and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Mexico. The bank provides high-quality credit products and flexible investment products to SMEs.

50,"Free pizza and beverages stoked up volunteers and staff about 1 p.m. for litter clean up Friday (July 23) at the U.S. Hill rest stop on State Road 518 before afternoon rain showers cut the day short from the planned 8-mile route to Peñasco.
Some 20 to 40 Taoseños, including Taos County Commission (Dist. 5) Chair Candyce O'Donnell, variously stuck around through monsoonal showers for as long as they could.
Kit Carson Electric Cooperative organized the clean up. Michael Santistevan, KCEC's Public Relations agent, smiled wryly as the rain began to fall Friday about 1:30 p.m., noting they will do litter clean up in the morning and serve lunch afterward when the next clean up is scheduled in the fall.
Dedicated Taoseños, plus employees of Taos County Public Works, U.S. Forest Service, Solid Waste and NM Department of Transportation all hung in and cleared culverts and the road side of State Road 518, starting at U.S. Hill and moving toward Peñasco.
Lorenzo Gutierrez, Solid Waste Code Enforcement, said by phone Tuesday (July 27) ""a few hardcore volunteers stayed, plus the Kit Carson crew. They called it off about 2 p.m., but it was amazing. It took me two days to dry off.
""It just felt good to be outdoors, away from this COVID stuff, you know?"" Gutierrez said about everyone's upbeat attitude. Since the Earth Day clean up April 22, he said he's noticed roads to be much better maintained, less trash overall. ""All in all, we're putting a dent in it.""
Another county litter removal is scheduled for the fall and all the county crews and companies will again be partnered up with county residents. ""It's all about teaching our young kids to respect and care for the land,"" Gutierrez said. ""And it's working.""

55,"Remember when Joe Biden ran for president in what commentators called the ""centrist"" lane of the Democratic primaries? The idea was that a ""moderate"" like Biden, unlike rival Bernie Sanders, would not push radical plans to completely change American society. That would reassure non-progressive Democrats, and independents, too, that Biden would be a safe choice for president. They didn’t want to remake the world. They just wanted things to get better.
You could see the difference in the Democratic debates. To take one example, at a debate in November 2019, Sanders urged people to join him ""if you want to be part of a movement that is not only going to beat Trump but transform America."" Biden’s pitch was much more modest; beating Trump and going back to the old ways were enough. ""Let’s take back this country,"" Biden said, ""and lead the world again.""
Now Biden is president and pushing vast, multi-trillion-dollar spending projects, the latest of which is the Build Back Better Act, a $2.2 trillion behemoth passed last week by Democrats (and Democrats alone) in the House of Representatives. And the old Biden centrist act is nowhere to be found. Now, the word the White House and Democrats on Capitol Hill have chosen to describe the president’s agenda is ""transform"" — just like Bernie used to say.
The White House frequently sends out emails headlined ""What They Are Saying,"" which collect quotes from Democratic politicians and interest group leaders praising Biden’s actions. Now, they are praising the Build Back Better Act. The praise has a certain similarity.
A ""What They Are Saying"" email listing statements from ""LGBTQI+ Leaders"" calls Build Back Better a ""transformational bill"" that will make a ""transformative investment"" to ""transform the lives of millions of Americans."" An email with the comments of ""Women and Family Advocates"" says the bill has ""transformational initiatives"" that will make ""transformative investments"" to effect a ""historic transformation"" that will ""transform the lives of children and families."" An email from ""Black Leaders"" says the ""transformational bill"" will make a ""transformative investment"" that will ""transform our nation for decades to come."" An email from ""Young Leaders"" calls BBB a ""transformative bill,"" while ""Gun Violence Prevention Leaders"" hail Biden’s ""transformational"" agenda.
You get the idea. But no one is more on board for the Biden transformation than Democrats in the House, where party members seem to disagree only on whether the bill should be called ""transformational"" or ""transformative."" Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls it ""transformative."" Rep. John Yarmouth calls it ""transformational."" Rep. Raul Grijalva chooses ""transformative."" Rep. Mark Takano, ""transformational."" Rep. Jerry Nadler, ""transformational."" Rep. Adam Smith, ""transformational."" Rep. Judy Chu, ""transformational."" Rep. Pramila Jayapal, ""transformative."" Rep. Brenda Lawrence, ""transformational."" Rep. Louis Frankel, ""transformational."" Rep. Barbara Lee, ""transformational."" Rep. Mike Quigley, ""transformative."" Rep. Joe Neguse, ""transformational."" Rep. Ayanna Pressley, ""transformational."" Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon, ""transformational."" Finally, Rep. Richard Neal, choosing not to take a side in that debate, says simply that BBB will ""transform our country.""
When Sanders pledged to ""transform"" the United States, he envisioned mind-boggling expenditures — say, $10 trillion — that would touch every aspect of American life. He didn’t win the White House, but he won the argument. During Biden’s presidency, Congress has passed a $1.9 trillion COVID relief bill (that had little to do with COVID relief) and a $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill, and now the House has passed the $2.2 trillion Build Back Better Act. In the end, Biden is likely to win about $5 trillion in extra spending just this year — about half of what Sanders wanted, but still mind-boggling. And it will touch every aspect of American life.
Finally, when it comes to rhetoric, there’s no doubt Sanders has won a smashing victory. The Biden White House sounds like Bernie Sanders. The Democratic leadership sounds like Bernie Sanders. The party’s interest groups sound like Bernie Sanders. You could say that the old socialist senator, once an outsider and lone voice, has managed to, yes, transform his party.

64,"MANSFIELD - Residents of Mansfield and Marion can rest assured their hospitals are some of the safest in the state.
Both OhioHealth facilities received a grade of A this week when the spring 2021 hospital ratings were released by Leapfrog, a nonprofit that analyzes the health care industry.
OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital and OhioHealth Marion General Hospital were among seven OhioHealth Hospitals to earn the high grade, the only hospital rating system focused exclusively on safety, according a news release prepared by Christina Thompson, a spokesperson for the health system.
Keeping a 'laser focus on patients and their safety
""An A safety grade is an elite designation that your community should be proud of,"" said Leah Binder, president and CEO of The Leapfrog Group. ""The past year has been extraordinarily difficult for hospitals, but these OhioHealth hospitals show us it is possible to keep a laser focus on patients and their safety, no matter what it takes.""
In addition to Mansfield and Marion hospitals, OhioHealth hospitals with an 'A' grade include: OhioHealth Berger Hospital in Circleville, OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital, OhioHealth Grady Memorial Hospital in Delaware, OhioHealth O'Bleness Hospital in Athens, and OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital in Columbus.
Because of their critical access hospital designation, OhioHealth Hardin Memorial Hospital and OhioHealth Shelby Hospital are not evaluated.
""Their sample size isn't large enough to be considered,"" Thompson explained. ""Their designation is to help rural communities.""
Shelby and Hardin hospitals are eligible for other recognition that Thompson said would be released later in the year.
Graded on 27 safety measures
More than 2,700 hospitals were graded by the D.C.-based Leapfrog organization on 27 publicly available safety measures, including: medication errors, infection rate, maternity care, critical care, complex adult surgery and elective outpatient surgery.
""Our associates and physicians have courageously led through COVID-19 pandemic in the communities we serve, and this rating validates our hard work and commitment to safety in our community,"" said Gavin Baumgardner, D.O., vice president of medical affairs at OhioHealth Mansfield Hospital.
Twice a year, in the spring and fall, the Leapfrog group assigns letter grades 'A' through 'F' based on a commitment to patient safety and a reduction of avoidable harm. Helping consumers protect themselves and their family members from errors, injuries, accidents, and infections is an important part of the grade.
""I'm so proud of our teams,"" added Curt Gingrich, M.D., president of Marion General Hospital. ""We are continuously working to create an even safer environment for our patients, providers, and associates. We foster an environment that educates and supports our teams in countless safety measures. Marion General Hospital has achieved 18 consecutive A Hospital Safety Grades in a row.""

66,"
FAIRFAX, Va.—Republican Glenn Youngkin held a narrow lead late Tuesday in the Virginia governor's race , which is being closely watched as a gauge of the national political mood.
Polls had shown former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin, a former private-equity executive , running neck-and-neck to succeed Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam. Virginia governors are barred from serving consecutive four-year terms.
No Republican has won a statewide race in Virginia since 2009, and the election will test Democrats' staying power after years of electoral gains. Republicans, meanwhile, hope to reverse losses in the vote-rich suburbs during former President Donald Trump's tenure.
President Biden, a Democrat, won Virginia by 10 percentage points over Mr. Trump last year, but his approval ratings have dipped to the low-40% range, making him a potential drag on Mr. McAuliffe . In addition, the state's off-year gubernatorial contest has historically favored the opposition party of the sitting president, with Mr. McAuliffe's 2013 victory being the only recent exception.
Mr. Biden, speaking to reporters in Glasgow on Tuesday, acknowledged that the race was close but said he thought Mr. McAuliffe would win. ""I don't believe and I've not seen any evidence that whether or not I'm doing well or poorly, or whether or not I've got my agenda passed or not, is going to have any real impact on winning or losing,"" Mr. Biden said.
Mr. McAuliffe, 64 years old, has consistently sought to tie Mr. Youngkin to Mr. Trump, a fellow Republican. Mr. Youngkin, 54, a former Carlyle Group co-chief executive and political newcomer, accepted Mr. Trump's endorsement but hasn't campaigned with him.
The former president praised Mr. Youngkin in a telephone rally late Monday, the Associated Press reported. ""Tomorrow I'd like to ask everyone to get out and vote for Glenn Youngkin,"" Mr. Trump told an invited group of supporters by phone. ""He's a fantastic guy.""
Virginia election officials said turnout was high. More than 3 million voters were reported late Tuesday, with votes still being counted. About 2.6 million Virginians voted in the last gubernatorial election in 2017, state election figures show. More than 2.2 million Virginians voted in the 2013 governor's race.
Voters who cast ballots in this election identified slightly more as Republicans than Democrats, 48% to 44%, according to preliminary results from AP VoteCast, a large survey of the Virginia electorate. If the finding holds, it would mark a change from the 2020 presidential election, in which VoteCast found the electorate to lean Democratic by 4 percentage points. The shift could indicate that Mr. Youngkin did a better job this year in motivating his party's core voters than did Mr. McAuliffe.
About two-thirds of voters in the survey said the country was headed in the wrong direction, while about one-third said it was on the right track. By a large margin, voters named the economy as the top issue facing the state, with smaller shares citing the coronavirus pandemic, education and other issues.
Nationally resonant issues such as abortion and vaccine mandates have permeated the race. Mr. McAuliffe, governor from 2014 to 2018, says he would defend women's access to abortion. Mr. Youngkin has indicated he would endorse new limits on abortion, though he has said he supports exceptions for rape, incest or to save a woman's life. On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments on a Texas law known as SB 8 or the Texas Heartbeat Act, which bans many abortions.
Both candidates have urged people to get Covid-19 vaccinations. Mr. McAuliffe has embraced mandates for some groups, like schoolchildren who are eligible to be vaccinated, saying such requirements are needed to help Virginia move past the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Youngkin says it should be a personal choice.
Virginia last year loosened its election rules to give any voter the option to vote by absentee ballot without needing a particular reason to qualify, and the state offered early voting on Sunday this year for the first time. More than 1.1 million voters have cast their ballots early, whether in person or by mail, according to the nonprofit Virginia Public Access Project. About 2.6 million Virginians voted in the last gubernatorial election in 2017, state election figures show.
Voting went largely smoothly on Tuesday, state elections Commissioner Chris Piper said at an evening news conference. There were some minor issues, Mr. Piper said, including one polling location that opened 10 minutes late, complaints about some voting machines getting jammed, and some precincts that ran out of ballots but then were supplied with more.
Speaking to reporters shortly after polls closed, Mr. Piper said he didn't want to make predictions about turnout. ""But the fact of the matter is that we have…we've seen heavy turnout,"" he added.
Both gubernatorial campaigns have legal teams on standby to handle any election issues.
Mr. Youngkin has nodded to Mr. Trump's unproven claims that the 2020 election was stolen without embracing them. He has said that President Biden legitimately won the election, that election integrity should be a priority, and that Virginia should audit its voting machines, which the state already does. Mr. Youngkin has said he believes Virginia will have a fair election.
Early Tuesday, voters trickled into a polling location at the Fairfax County Government Center. Activists from both parties said the site had been much busier during early voting.
Manju Mallin, 62, said she voted for Mr. Youngkin mainly because of his view on schools. She said she didn't think critical race theory should be taught in schools, and Mr. Youngkin has said he would ban it. Many education officials in Virginia have said their schools don't teach critical race theory, which is an academic legal theory, and instead say they are teaching about diversity and the history of minority communities.
""Parents are not being heard,"" said Ms. Mallin, who is retired but works part time in sales for an insurance company. She said she voted for Mr. Trump in 2020 but also voted for Democrats in the past.

Mandeep Kaur, 25, who works in human resources, said she voted for Mr. McAuliffe because she believed he would protect abortion rights and support immigration, among other issues.
""We saw what happened in Texas with abortion,"" said Ms. Kaur, who said she became a citizen last year after immigrating from India. ""I think women should have the choice.""
Charles Armstead, 73, said he voted for Mr. McAuliffe. ""I think that the Republicans are still too entrapped by Donald Trump and his ideals,"" said Mr. Armstead, who said he is an independent voter and a Defense Department consultant and retired Air Force officer. He said he worried that Republicans would restrict voting rights.
In Virginia Beach, Valerie Register said she voted Tuesday morning for Mr. Youngkin on her way back from the gym. The 53-year-old software developer said she shared his antiabortion views. She also said she thought he would roll back what she sees as growing government interference in areas such as gun ownership and Covid-19 vaccination decisions.
""It seems like we're headed down the wrong road where they're trying to push into more and more government control. By voting for Youngkin, I believe we're trying to pull back on that,"" she said.
Voters in New Jersey also voted for a governor Tuesday. Late Tuesday night, Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy was narrowly behind Republican Jack Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman. The candidates have clashed over fiscal issues as well as Mr. Murphy's requirement for students to wear masks in schools. Three nonpartisan surveys released in the past week showed Mr. Murphy leading by roughly 10 points over Mr. Ciattarelli.
Virginia Democrats are also vying to retain control of the state's house of delegates. In 2019, Democrats gained majorities in both the House and state Senate, giving them a trifecta, with Mr. Northam already in the governor's office. Democrats hold a 55-45 advantage in the House, and all 100 seats are up for election. None of the 40 Senate seats are on the ballot.
Across the U.S., there are 23 Republican trifectas, 15 Democratic trifectas, and 12 divided governments where neither party holds trifecta control, according to election-data website Ballotpedia.
As Election Day neared, Republican voters in Virginia appeared more excited than Democrats, according to a poll released last week by Christopher Newport University's Wason Center for Civic Leadership. It found 80% of Republican likely voters said they were very enthusiastic, compared with 65% of Democrats. That ""enthusiasm advantage"" has grown since its Oct. 8 survey, the center said.
The poll found that independent voters favor Mr. Youngkin over Mr. McAuliffe 51% to 44%. For Mr. Youngkin, key sources of support are white voters, men and residents of Virginia's southern and southwestern areas, the poll found, whereas Mr. McAuliffe's support is strongest among Black voters, women and Northern Virginia residents.

69,"Fourteen portable refrigerated morgues are headed to Central Florida to help beleaguered hospitals store bodies, officials said Friday.
The number of deaths right now is unprecedented, said Lynne Drawdy, executive director of the Central Florida Disaster Medical Coalition, who ordered the units for health systems here. What were hearing from the hospitals is that the death count right now is higher than it ever has been.
Although she could not say how many of the deaths are due to COVID-19, she said COVID-19 is unquestionably the precipitating event.
Florida is now reporting an average of 227 COVID-19 deaths a day  -  a state record and by far the highest count in the nation.
Across the U.S., 864 people died per day over the past week with COVID-19, said Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Thats an 11% increase from the week prior.
The state Health Department in Orange County received reports of 19 COVID-19 deaths between Monday and Thursday, and 10 more Friday, but its unclear when the deaths occurred as reports are often delayed. But still weve never had a day where we had 10 reported overnight, said Raul Pino, health officer in Orange County.
He said the death counts, like the countys high infection rate, are fueled by the über-contagious delta variant and unvaccinated people.
There is no question that the delta variant had changed everything, he said. But if we were at higher rates of vaccination, lets say 80 to 85% of our eligible population, the numbers would be smaller.
Pino said he was concerned that hospitals are calling the death figure unprecedented.
That means that likely in the coming weeks we are going to see bad, bad numbers, he said.
Finding morgue capacity is a top priority of health systems, said Drawdy.
She said the portable morgues hold a dozen bodies each. Adding 14 portables makes space for 168 more bodies.
Unlike last year, we dont have a state declaration [of emergency] that releases other resources and assets such as FEMORS, she said, referring to the Florida Emergency Mortuary Operations Response System, based at the University of Floridas William R. Maples Center for Forensic Medicine.
AdventHealths Central Florida Division attributed the capacity issue to backup at local funeral homes.
Funeral homes across Florida say they are overwhelmed with bodies right now.
FEMORS was deployed to assist in recovery operations at the Champlain Towers South condominium tower collapse in Surfside, Florida. The organization also responded to Orlando in 2016 to help local authorities after the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub, which killed 49 patrons and employees.
The coalitions district, which includes Brevard, Indian River, Lake, Martin, Orange, Osceola, Seminole and Volusia counties, covers 50 hospitals.
We cant provide one to every single hospital, Drawdy said.
The coalition instead has worked with hospital systems in hopes of covering them all, she said.
AdventHealth for instance will get three units. Orlando Health also will get three.
The Central Florida Disaster Medical Coalition offered Orlando Health three portable refrigeration units, which we accepted out an abundance of caution. We did not request them and have no plans or need to utilize them at this time. Orlando Health has adequate morgue capacity, said Kena Lewis, a spokesper

73,"Jan. 19 - Ann Arbor  -  Maybe it had to do with the fact Michigan was playing at home for the first time in the month. Maybe it had to do with the return of sophomore center Hunter Dickinson. Or maybe some of it had to do with the Wolverines facing a reeling Terrapins team.
Whatever is was, Michigan kicked off a soft stretch of its schedule with a sound effort and snapped a three-game skid with an 83-64 wire-to-wire win over Maryland on Tuesday at Crisler Center.
Dickinson was back in the starting lineup after missing last week's game at Illinois and finished with 21 points on 10-for-14 shooting, six rebounds and six assists in 30 minutes to lead Michigan (8-7, 2-3 Big Ten).
Freshman forward Caleb Houstan snapped out of his shooting slump with 16 points and three made 3-pointers, freshman forward Moussa Diabate added 14 points and grad transfer guard DeVante' Jones scored 12 for the Wolverines, which shot 58.3% from the field (35-for-60) and 40% from 3-point range (8-for-20).
Eric Ayala scored 22, Donta Scott 19 and Julian Reese 10 for Maryland (9-9, 1-6), which has lost five of six and trailed by double digits the final 26 minutes of the game.
BOX SCORE: Michigan 83, Maryland 64
Michigan got off to a strong start with Dickinson and Houstan carrying the offense. The Wolverines played through Dickinson in the post early and he had a hand in Michigan's first seven points, opening the scoring with a bucket in the paint before dishing out a pair of assists out of double-teams.
Houstan knocked down his first three shots, including his first look from beyond the arc off a feed from Dickinson and a three-point play. The latter basket helped spark a 9-0 spurt that Diabate capped with a dunk and put Michigan up, 20-9, with 10:59 left in the first half.

Maryland, meanwhile, didn't have much success against Michigan's defense, which was active and engaged from the start. By the time the Terrapins cracked double digits in scoring at the 10:17 mark, they had more turnovers (six) than made field goals (five).
Things didn't get much better for Maryland from that point as the Wolverines took advantage of a rough shooting stretch and a four-minute scoring drought with a 13-0 flurry. Dickinson kick-started the run by setting up Jones for an open 3-pointer with another pass out of a double-team.
On the next possession, Dickinson drained a 3-pointer of his own. By the time Jones splashed another deep ball, Michigan's lead swelled to 35-14 as it took a 20-point cushion into the break.
Michigan widened the gap after halftime as Maryland struggled to contain Dickinson's scoring and passing on post-up touches. After backing down a defender and scoring a layup, Dickinson found Houstan for a 3-pointer to give Michigan a 46-21 lead with 18:30 remaining.
Even though Michigan's defense wasn't nearly as crisp and was sloppy at times in the second half, it was able to score enough to counter a hot shooting stretch by Maryland. The Terrapins made 10 of their first 12 shots to chop the deficit down to 57-44 with 11:12 to play, but they couldn't make things uncomfortable.
The Wolverines responded with a string a six straight points, highlighted by an acrobatic finish by freshman guard Frankie Collins off a lob pass, to keep the Terrapins at bay. Dickinson added a couple more baskets in the paint to push the lead back over 20 and give Michigan a 71-48 cushion with 5:17 remaining. From there, Michigan maintained an 18-point lead before it emptied its bench in the closing minutes.
Senior forward Brandon Johns Jr. went through pregame warm-ups for the second straight game but didn't play as his conditioning isn't up to par. It's the third straight contest he's sat out after contracting COVID-19 and feeling effects. Like Johns, Dickinson had recently contracted COVID-19 and cleared protocols, but he didn't practice much leading up to the Illinois contest and sat as a precautionary measure.

74,"Publication: Vermont Cynic, , University of Vermont, Burlington, VTUVM reported nearly 100 new COVID-19 cases in the last week, nearly 70 of which were off-campus, marking an all-time high in UVM’s weekly case-count since the start of the pandemic. 
Additionally, the VT Department of Health recently confirmed the presence of the more contagious B.1.1.7 variant within the student body, according to a March 22 email from Gary Derr, VP of Operations and Public Safety. 
“Recently, it was confirmed through the Vermont Department of Health that 4 of 5 random samples from UVM tested positive for the UK variant (B.1.1.7) of COVID-19,” he stated in the email. 
Originally seen in the UK, the presence of B.1.1.7 was first confirmed in Chittenden County on March 8, according to a VTDigger article. 
The University saw 69 new COVID-19 cases among off-campus students, 24 new cases among on-campus students and two new cases among staff members in the last week, according to the University’s weekly testing report. 
In the last three weeks, 98 off-campus students in total tested positive for the virus. 
The email stated that the recently imposed twice-weekly testing mandate for students will once again be extended through this upcoming week. 
This is the third time the University has decided to extend the twice-weekly testing mandate, despite a March 12 email from Derr stating that “beginning the week of March 22, we anticipate returning to testing every seven days.” 
The night of St. Patrick’s Day UVM received reports of multiple student gatherings, according to a March 19 email from Derr. Continuing twice-weekly testing would help to prevent the further spread of COVID-19 potentially caused by these gatherings, he stated.
“As you may recall, in the early part of this semester we saw a concerning growth in on-campus residential students testing positive,” Derr stated in that same email. “This week, we saw a dramatic decline.”  
If that trend were to continue through the end of the week, UVM at the time felt optimistic about reinstating the on-campus guest policy for this week, the March 19 email stated. 
The guest policy allowed one masked guest into residential rooms. The policy was only briefly in place during the fall semester. Now, with 24 new cases on-campus, there has been no further mention of reinstating the guest policy in Derr’s more recent email. 
“The results from last week are not encouraging,” Derr stated in the March 22 email. “This is important information as the variant spreads more readily and symptoms appear sooner and can be more severe.” 
The presence of multiple variants has been discovered across the country, with 55,000 new COVID-19 cases reported daily nationwide, according to the email. 
Chittenden County reported nearly 500 new cases in the last 14 days and the state has seen more than 2,400 cases since the start of the month. 
“I know we are all frustrated and tired of the impact of COVID-19 on our lives. But it is vitally important to increase our diligence,” Derr stated. “We are encouraged by the plan to vaccinate all Vermonters, including UVM students, by July 1.” 
Students must continue to follow protocols that are already in place, Derr stated, such as wearing face coverings, maintaining 6-foot physical distancing and avoiding social gatherings.

80,"BLACKWOOD — To commemorate the first anniversary of the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines being administered, the Camden County Health Hub will hold a special one-day clinic Wednesday, Dec. 15 with county officials in attendance.
Normally, the Health Hub, located at Camden County College's Blackwood campus, offers vaccines every Tuesday and Thursday. Wednesday's clinic will be open 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. All three doses will be available. Additionally, boosters will be available for 16- and 17-year-olds after the age group was recently authorized to receive it by the FDA and CDC.
The clinic is part of Boost NJ Day, a statewide effort to continue vaccinating individuals against the coronavirus.
""Thinking back to one year ago, it seems like we were in a completely different world,"" Camden County Commissioner Director Louis Cappelli Jr. said. ""We were just administering the very first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and didn't know what the future would hold. But thanks to the remarkable collaborative work that elected officials, healthcare professionals and residents did over the past year, we've been able to get to where we are now, with more than 325,000 people in the county fully vaccinated and counting.""
Cappelli will be at the Health Hub with County Commissioner Carmen Rodriguez, County Health Officer Dr. Paschal Nwako, Cooper University Health Care Senior Vice President Louis Bezich, and Rutgers-Camden School of Nursing Associate Dean Dr. Kevin Emmons. The group will also go over the next phase of changes coming to the facility.
""Health officials are now recommending that all adults get a booster shot, regardless of prior health qualifiers,"" Cappelli said. ""With case counts increasing and the holidays coming up, we need all of the protection we can possibly get. So please, get a booster shot and if you haven't done so already, please get your first or second dose.""

Under the FDA's latest authorizations, all three approved vaccines now have a booster shot. PHOTO: Landon Speers for The Wall Street Journal
A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advisory panel endorsed booster doses of vaccines from Moderna Inc. and Johnson & Johnson and gave their support to mixing primary vaccines with a different booster dose.
The panel on Thursday didn't recommend any of the boosters over the others. However, some members said they wanted to see people who received a J&J vaccine get a booster from Pfizer Inc. and partner BioNTech SE or from Moderna.
The first vote passed 15-0, backing boosters six months after their second dose for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccine recipients who are seniors, have underlying medical conditions or at high risk of Covid-19 because of where they work.
The second vote backing a booster of any kind for people 18 years and over, at least two months after receiving the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, also passed 15-0.
The panel's vote also backed mixing and matching for people who received the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
The votes follow the Food and Drug Administration's authorization Wednesday of Moderna and Johnson & Johnson booster shots. The agency also said people can get an extra dose that is different from the vaccine they received for their primary series.
The CDC's signoff is the last step before the Moderna and J&J boosters become available. While the FDA regulates medical products, the CDC offers guidance about the practice of medicine, and many vaccination sites have been following the agency's direction.
Soon the CDC is expected to issue recommendations about who should get boosters and how many months people must wait before getting them.
The Biden administration has sought boosters to bolster vaccinated people's immune defenses, especially against the contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Some health experts, however, say there isn't enough evidence to support giving boosters widely.
""I can't say I am comfortable that anyone under 50, otherwise healthy, needs a booster at this time,"" said Sarah Long, a committee member who specializes in pediatric infectious diseases at Drexel University College of Medicine.
Some panel members said they would prefer that Johnson & Johnson vaccine recipients get an extra dose of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna rather than another J&J dose. They said another J&J dose could potentially cause a rare side effect, a blood clotting condition that is linked to the J&J vaccine, and that a messenger RNA dose might also offer stronger protection.
Regulators have already added warnings about the rare side effect, called thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS, to the shot's label.
The booster campaign has been rolling out since August, starting with extra doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine or the one from Moderna for people with compromised immune systems.
Then last month, seniors and high-risk people began getting an additional dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine at least six months after they had finished getting the two-dose primary series.
Under the FDA's latest authorizations, all three approved vaccines now have a booster shot.
In addition, any adult who got a J&J vaccine may get a booster from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna or J&J at least two months after the single-dose shot.
People who were initially vaccinated with a Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine can get any booster at least six months after their second dose so long as they are seniors or at high risk because of underlying medical conditions or their workplace.
The shots will be free and available at pharmacies, doctors' offices and vaccination sites around the country. The U.S. will have enough shots to meet demand, people familiar with the matter said.
 The J&J booster is the same dose as the first vaccine, and the Moderna booster, regardless of what vaccine a person received first, is half the dose as the first two shots.
The U.S. vaccine campaign is expected to continue to expand in the coming weeks. The FDA is expected to next clear Pfizer vaccines for children age 5 to 11 years old, and is also weighing whether to expand the booster campaign to people as young as 40 years old, according to people familiar with the matter.
More than 69 million people are fully vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, and more than 15 million people have received the single-dose J&J vaccine, according to the CDC.
The panel also reviewed new information about the risks of myocarditis, particularly in young men, after vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines that both use messenger RNA technology.
Some safety databases found a heightened risk of myocarditis among people ages 18-39, particularly men, after being vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine as compared with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, according to analyses by a vaccine safety committee.
 The FDA has delayed clearing Moderna's vaccine in adolescents while it assesses the risk of myocarditis, The Wall Street Journal has reported. Preliminary data on patients 18 to 39 years found that the cases are generally mild and resolve quickly, according to the analysis of the vaccine safety committee.
The committee also said there is limited data available about the risk of myocarditis after the third dose of Moderna, including at half the dosage of the first two shots. The smaller dose might lead to less risk of myocarditis, a committee group said. There is also limited safety data about a second J&J shot, but the group said the risks are unlikely to be greater than with the first shot.

84,"The city of Boston will provide 20,000 free rapid antigen home tests as well as free masks to communities with the highest rates of COVID-19 and high barriers to purchasing test kits on their own, Dr. Bisola Ojikutu, executive director of the Boston Public Health Commission, announced Monday.Ojikutu joined Mayor Michelle Wu for a press conference in which Wu also announced members of a new COVID-19 advisory committee, which will be chaired by Ojikutu.Ojikutu said the city will distribute the free tests and masks ahead of the holidays. She said the city is also expanding access to vaccines, including by holding higher capacity vaccine clinics.The moves are part of a four-pronged initiative unveiled Monday by the Wu administration to combat the latest phase of the pandemic, as the Omicron variant bears down on Massachusetts.The city's newly announced vaccine clinics will be held on Saturday, Dec. 11, Dec. 18, and two Saturdays in January. The first of these will be held at Vine Street Community Center in Roxbury, and there will also be a clinic at City Hall on Thursday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.The city already has seven family vaccination walk-in clinics in Dorchester, Mattapan, Roxbury, Hyde Park, and Roslindale.“We are currently in the midst of an anticipated COVID-19 winter surge,” Ojikutu said, with Boston's rate of COVID-19 tests that return positive at 5.2 percent, up 15 percent from two weeks ago. The city is also expecting a jump in cases over the holidays. Ojikutu said 5 percent “is a threshold of concern” for the positivity rate.“COVID-19 cases and hospitalization are up while vaccination among some of our most vulnerable populations is lagging behind to address this threat,” she said. “Vaccination is critical to ending this pandemic.”Ojikutu said 67 percent of Boston's overall population is fully vaccinated, but only 21 percent of those have received booster doses.Ojikutu also said the city would focus on boosting vaccination rates among children, which are lagging and reflecting racial disparities seen throughout the pandemic.Only one quarter of all children in Boston ages five through 11 have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Ojikutu said. Almost 60 percent of white non-Hispanic children have been vaccinated, compared to just 35 percent of Asian children, 10 percent Latinx, and 7 percent of black children who have received their first dose.Ojikutu said part of the city's motivation for expanding vaccine clinics was hearing that people had challenges obtaining appointments for boosters. With these walk-in clinics, “there's no online component.”“We're trying to get rid of the barriers that we think are stopping people from obtaining boosters or childhood vaccines or anything really,” Ojikutu said.She said students and their families will have increased access to clinics at schools across the city throughout December and January, in partnership with Boston Medical Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Tufts Medical Center.Along with increasing vaccinations and testing, the city's four-pronged COVID-19 strategy also aims to enhance health communication, and double down on prevention.Ojikutu said the city is working with organizations on the ground, such as the Black Boston COVID-19 Coalition and the Greater Boston Latino Network, to help disseminate vaccine information. Meanwhile, indoor mask mandates remain in effect to attempt to curb the spread of disease.At the press conference, Wu also announced the new 17-member COVID-19 advisory group made up of public health professionals and community, business, and cultural leaders, that will assist in decision-making around tackling new variants and working to end the pandemic in Boston, according to a news release from the city.“Everything is on the table and the goal of this group is to move quickly,” Wu said, adding that Boston is in a very “urgent situation.”“The goal is to not only provide recommendations for what we need to decide right now in this moment as we're headed into winter, but to help us think through the long-term impacts of this pandemic,” she said.Ojikutu said the arrival of the Omicron variant in Massachusetts makes it even more important for Boston to be prepared. Though the patient's symptoms were mild and did not require hospitalization, Ojikutu said there are some epidemiological data suggesting the variant is more transmissible and poses a greater risk of reinfection.“More data are needed before we can answer any questions conclusively, but we're monitoring the situation very, very carefully,” she said. “In this time of uncertainty, it's important to remain vigilant but also to be calm.”The members of the new COVID-19 advisory committee are:Dr. Sabrina A.

VIRUS INACTION SOWS DISCONTENT
Loudoun, Pr. William vie to manage health systems

Two of Virginia's fastest-growing local jurisdictions are working to create their own health departments, a step that could move most of Northern Virginia out of the state system on key aspects of public health, including coronavirus vaccinations.
Both Loudoun and Prince William counties say they've been hampered in their ability to address the health needs of their communities under the system of state-run health districts that governs most of Virginia.
Some crucial jobs have been left vacant, while a lack of resources and too much bureaucracy have stalled efforts to open vaccination clinics in underserved areas, officials in those counties say.
""If anything good came out of the pandemic, I would say it exposed the soft underbelly of our public health department,"" said Ann Wheeler (D), chair of the county board in Prince William, where the state health district also covers the cities of Manassas and Manassas Park.
Legislation awaiting Gov. Ralph Northam's (D) signature would grant Prince William and Loudoun administrative control of their health departments, allowing them to join Fairfax and Arlington counties as the only localities in the state with such authority. A law is required before the move, under Virginia's 125-year-old status as a Dillon Rule state, under which the commonwealth retains legal authority that is not explicitly granted to a local government.
Fairfax County, which won control of its health department in 1995, broke away from the state on vaccination registration last month, declining to participate in Virginia's initially troubled centralized registration system. Arlington, which gained local control in 1988, is using the state program.
State Sen. Barbara A. Favola, who sponsored the legislation, said it makes sense for local governments with enough money for local health programs to have that freedom, particularly during a pandemic.
""Local government is much closer to the constituents,"" said Favola (D-Arlington), who sits on the Senate's committee for local government. ""They have the people who know exactly what to do when there is a public health emergency.""
Alena Yarmosky, Northam's spokesperson, said the governor is still reviewing the legislation but is supportive of efforts that will improve the public health infrastructure in the state.
Yarmosky said the governor recently signed a law aimed at steering more state money into state health districts.
""One of the major challenges has been an outdated funding formula for local health districts that hasn't been changed in a generation,"" Yarmosky said. 
The bill before Northam originated in Loudoun. Phyllis J. Randall, chair of Loudoun's board, said discussions about local control began several years ago, when a discrepancy in the health district's pay structure made it harder to retain workers on the state health department payroll.
The districts' staffs are a mix of state and local employees who, besides responding to the pandemic, run locally funded programs such as mental health services and restaurant inspections. Health district directors manage both sets of workers in a two-tiered operation that includes separate health benefits.
The workers paid by the state tend to make less than those on the county's payroll, even when they have the same titles and job functions, making it harder to retain them, Randall (D) said.
For example, the average annual salary for a registered nurse employed by the state is about $74,000, while a county-employed nurse would make an average $87,000 per year, according to data provided by Loudoun officials.
""Because they can get paid more someplace else, we would lose the state employees,"" Randall said.
The pandemic added another complication.
Each time Loudoun's health district director David Goodfriend wanted to set up a coronavirus testing site or make vaccinations more widely available, he was required to get state approval, which could take a long time.
""It delayed things more than it needed to be,"" Randall said.
Prince William officials have been aggravated by the health district system, prompting them to ask Favola to include their county in the Loudoun bill.
Supervisors in the county, where people of color make up 58 percent of the population, have been frustrated over the vaccination rates in lower-income communities, with just 36 percent of doses administered so far given to African American, Latino or Asian residents.
""Our health district was offered opportunities to hold vaccination sites in different locations, but if you don't have the manpower to even manage it, how do you address that?"" Wheeler said.
State officials said they have been pouring more resources into Prince William, including a federally funded mass vaccination site near the Potomac Mills shopping center that is scheduled to open  this week.  Yarmosky noted that site will be able to administer as many as 6,000 doses per day.
But the district has 23 unfilled positions, including six public health nurses and two nurse supervisors.
The vacancies in the health district have made it harder to respond to the pandemic, said Alison Ansher, the district's director.
Some nurses have recently been hired, she said. But, she added, ""this has also impacted our pandemic response as they are still orienting.""
With anxious constituents pleading for more vaccinations in their communities, frustrated county supervisors have repeatedly pressed Ansher to do more.
""If those numbers are the same next month, people need to be fired,"" Supervisor Pete Candland (R-Gainesville) said to Ansher during a board meeting  this month about the lower vaccination rates in communities of color. Ansher, a state employee, did not respond.
Supervisor Margaret A. Franklin, who launched the county's effort to gain local control, said that kind of oversight would make it easier to develop a targeted response to health emergencies.
""That's the biggest challenge: We're the Board of County Supervisors, but we're not actually in charge,"" Franklin (D-Woodbridge) said. ""It's left us vulnerable during the unforeseen case of having a pandemic.""
Local government advocacy groups in the state say other jurisdictions have not sought similar control, though Virginia Beach has entertained the idea amid problems with vaccinations that city officials blame on having to share a local state health district director with the city of Norfolk, 20 miles away.
Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer asked Northam to allow the city to run its own vaccination program but was turned down. In response, Yarmosky pointed to the bill Northam recently signed that would put more state resources into the system.
Dyer said that even with more resources from the state, the city is pushing the state to hire a state health district director for Virginia Beach, adding that the question of seeking local authority is on the table.
""If we can eliminate the bureaucracy, that's optimal,"" he said. ""The more autonomy we have as a city, the better.""

86,"Vaccine advisers to the US Food and Drug Administration voted 17-0 with one abstention Tuesday to recommend emergency use authorization of Pfizer's Covid-19 vaccine in children ages 5 to 11.
Members of the FDA's Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee agreed the benefits of vaccinating younger children appeared to outweigh the risks, but some members appeared troubled about voting to vaccinate a large population of younger children based on studies of a few thousand.
""It is reassuring to me that we are giving a lower dose,"" said Dr. Paul Offit, who directs the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Pfizer has cut its vaccine to one-third of the adult dose for the children under 12 and said clinical trials showed this lower dose protected children well against symptomatic infection. The hope is it will cause fewer side-effects.
""We think that we have optimized immune response and minimized reactions,"" Pfizer senior vice president William Gruber told the meeting.
One big issue was the theoretical risk of myocarditis -- an inflammatory heart condition. It's been seen in some people who got Pfizer and Moderna vaccines and is more common among young men, although it's usually mild. Not enough young children were tested to show whether they're also at risk.
""We've identified a lower dose which we expect is going to decrease the frequency of the rare side effect of myocarditos,"" said Dr. Arnold Monto, chairman of the committee an a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michgan.
""I am just worried that if we say yes, then the states are going to mandate administration of this vaccine for children to go to school and I do not agree with that,"" said Dr. Cody Meissner, a professor of pediatrics at Tufts University School of Medicine. ""I think that would be an error at this time.""
But Dr. Peter Marks, who heads the FDA's vaccine arm, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said that was unlikely.
""Just to reassure the committee, because we are taking an emergency use authorization rather than an approval, in general, although it's possible that mandates could be put in place, I suppose, in general people have not done mandates with emergency use authorizations and there are certain governors who have already announced that they would not do a mandate until there was an approval as opposed to an emergency use authorization,"" Marks said after the vote.
And Dr. Amanda Cohn of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reminded the committee that children have died of Covid-19. According to CDC, more than 700 children 18 and under have died of Covid-19. ""We don't want children dying of Covid,"" she said. ""And we don't want children in the ICU.""
The FDA had said that, under most of the scenarios it projected, the benefits of vaccinating younger children would outweigh any risks, and Pfizer said clinical trials showed the vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing symptomatic infection in children.
The FDA will now take the committee's vote under consideration and is likely to extend EUA to the vaccine for younger children in the coming days.
Then vaccine advisers to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will meet next week, November 2-3, to discuss the decision and decide whether to recommend that US kids get the vaccine. The final word will lie with CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky, and vaccination could begin next week if she gives the go-ahead.
The US federal government has a plan in place for delivering the smaller-sized vaccines to pediatricians' offices, pharmacies and other venues across the country.
""The safety monitoring of this vaccine will continue. It has actually been quite intense,"" Marks added.
Pfizer's vaccine is authorized for youths aged 12-17, and a CNN analysis of CDC data shows about half of adolescents in this age group in the US are fully vaccinated.

87,"NEW YORK — Give the Rangers credit.
They know how to keep us guessing.
After a tumultuous week in which their best player took a shocking leave of absence and two others appeared on the NHL's COVID-19 protocol list, few would have predicted a lopsided win over the first-place Boston Bruins.
So, it figures the Blueshirts would come away with a 6-2 rout.
Perhaps they received a jolt from having fans in Madison Square Garden for the first time in nearly a year. Their last home game with spectators was March 7, 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic keeping them away ever since.
The doors reopened Friday night, with 1,800 fans returning as the building was limited to 10% capacity.
They were welcomed back with a physical and entertaining showing.
The Rangers (7-8-3) countered the feisty Bruins (11-5-2) by showing their own toughness — and they were much more effective in their offensive execution, netting a season-high six goals.
After receiving good pregame news, with rookie defenseman K'Andre Miller returning after a short one-game stint on the COVID list, the Rangers struck first.
Julien Gauthier carried the puck into the Boston zone, spun, and then whipped a wrist shot past goalie Tuukka Rask on the near post for his second goal of the season and second of his NHL career.
That served as the only goal in the first period, but the Rangers would open the game up with three more in the second.
They made it 2-0 just 2:32 into the period, with rookie Alexis Lafrenière serving as the catalyst. The No. 1 overall pick sent a sharp cross-ice pass to Ryan Strome, with the veteran snapping a wrist shot for his sixth goal of the season. It was also the first assist of Lafrenière's NHL career.
Patrice Bergeron cut the Bruins' deficit to 2-1 just a minute-and-a-half later, but the Rangers would finish the period with a flurry.
A late power play resulted in a one-timer from Strome to Adam Fox, which Colin Blackwell deflected in with 1:08 remaining to push the lead to 3-1. And just 12 seconds later, Chris Kreider netted his team-leading ninth goal of the season on a tough-angle shot that snuck by Rask on the near post.
That sent the Rangers into the third period with a commanding 4-1 lead, but they didn't take their foot off the pedal.
Pavel Buchnevich and Jonny Brodzinski each added a goal in the opening four minutes of the period to push it to 6-1, rendering an eventual Boston goal from Brad Marchand meaningless. Alexandar Georgiev finished with 31 saves for his third win of the season and second in as many starts.
The result was a signature win for a Rangers' team that was missing four key players — forwards Artemi Panarin (leave of absence), Filip Chytil (hand) and Kaapo Kakko (COVID list), plus defenseman Jacob Trouba (broken thumb).

89,"""There was a flurry of reporting early on because people were trying to get a good sense of it. ... I think it's the nature of the beast.""
Dr. Susan Koletar
Director of the division of infectious diseases at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center
Ohioans have reported nearly 6,000 medical issues arising in the days and weeks following their COVID-19 vaccinations, but it's impossible to know which problems, if any, were actually caused by the shots.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention allows anyone to submit a report to its Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) online. That means reports are not verified and many of the symptoms people report, other than the expected mild side effects, might have no direct link to the shot, said Dr. Susan Koletar, director of the division of infectious diseases at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.
A wide range of adverse events were reported by Ohioans on VAERS in the months since the vaccine rollout began. People reported everything from abnormal X-rays and colonoscopies, to concussions, pink eye, general feelings of apathy and on the more serious side, suspected blood clots.
""It is absolutely not a reason to not get it,"" Koletar said. ""A lot of (the reports) are expected side effects. People should expect that their arm should hurt a little bit. ... Is getting the vaccine worth not feeling great? I think the answer is yes.""
In fact, the most common events reported to the CDC in Ohio were fever and chills, arm pain and an assortment of body aches, according to the database. In a way, Koletar said that should reassure people as to what they can expect.
Such side effects are more common after people receive a second dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and can actually be a sign that the immune system is working to create protective antibodies against the virus, Koletar and other experts have said.
""There is much we still do not know about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. However, we do know that this vaccine is safe and can prevent symptomatic COVID-19 and severe disease,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said earlier this year in a news release.
Some symptoms, such as anaphylaxis, are required to be reported by doctors to VAERS, Koletar said. Anaphylaxis, an allergic reaction to a vaccine, was reported 33 times in Ohio.
As of Thursday, 5,939 events in Ohio had been reported to VAERS, meaning 3% of the total 192,146 events reported nationwide occurred among Ohioans.
The number of events reported by Ohioans wasn't a huge surprise to Koletar. In the early days of the rollout in mid-December, doctors were hypersensitive to any issue that arose with COVID-19 vaccines, regardless of whether the shot was the likely culprit, Koletar said.
Erring on the side of caution is typical with a new vaccine for a new disease, Koletar said.
""Early on, there was a lot of reporting of side effects,"" Koletar said. ""There was a flurry of reporting early on because people were trying to get a good sense of it. ... I think it's the nature of the beast.""
Looking through VAERS reports is similar to searching for a ""needle in a haystack,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University in Nashville.
Occasionally though, the CDC does find a needle. The exceedingly rare blood clots that arose in some women after they got the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine is a prime example of how well the system can work, Schaffner said. The J&J vaccine was paused April 13 after six initial cases of rare yet serious blood clots were discovered in recipients of the shot. It was allowed to resume April 23 after the Food and Drug Administration and the CDC concluded it was safe and the clots were uncommon.
Although some Ohioans reported developing blood clots after getting vaccinated, none reported the rare clot following a J&J vaccination in Ohio, CDC data shows.
Extremely rare yet similar events are exactly what the CDC is looking for in VAERS reports, Schaffner said. Despite the J&J issue, Schaffner said it's unlikely any other problems will arise with the COVID-19 vaccines already on the market, since they've been available for several months now.
""With every day that you vaccinate more people, the likelihood that you find another needle in the haystack diminishes,"" Schaffner said. ""That kind of reinforces the general concept of vaccinating against COVID.""
Although VAERS helped the CDC catch the J&J blood clotting issue, the system still came under fire recently due to the fact that submitted data is publicly available even if reports are unconfirmed or highly unlikely.
On his HBO show ""Last Week Tonight,"" comedian John Oliver criticized VAERS after someone reported that a flu shot turned him into the The Hulk. Jokes aside, Koletar said people should take VAERS seriously and only use it to report actual concerns.
But Koletar and Schaffner do worry that if the reports are taken out of context, VAERS could be used as an argument against vaccination. People need to remember that reports on VAERS are unverified and may not be the result of vaccination whatsoever, Schaffner said.
""The system really does work. I think it's the best vaccine surveillance system by far in the world. This is really a model of how it is supposed to work,"" Schaffner said. ""The con is people just accept this information at face value when they shouldn't. It's not designed for that. But that's the price of transparency.""

91,"The truck stays here. Former Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz was traded to Indianapolis, but his South Jersey-based food truck won't follow him to the Midwest.
It will continue to serve area communities with free food, according to Kyle Horner, senior pastor of The Connect Church in Cherry Hill, which partnered with Wentz's AO1 Foundation in 2018 to launch Thy Kingdom Crumb food truck.
The food truck serves South Jersey, the Philadelphia area and even Delaware and does pop up events, dishing out free food, often to underserved communities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Thy Kingdom Crumb truck has remained in Cherry Hill, where it offers to-go food donations of items like chili, chicken pasta primavera, meatball sandwiches, packaged and distributed following pandemic safety protocols.
""I'm incredibly proud of what we've been able to accomplish through Thy Kingdom Crumb since we launched it in 2018, and I only want to see this ministry continue to grow in the years to come,"" Wentz said in a statement provided by TKC. ""Regardless of where I'm playing, I believe that through the gift of free food, TKC will continue to demonstrate God's love to the people of the greater Philadelphia area.""
Wentz was the No. 2 overall pick of the 2016 NFL Draft by the Eagles and was expected to be their franchise quarterback for many years. He was traded to the Colts in February for two draft picks.
Horner said repeatedly that Wentz is the ""real deal"" and that the quarterback has pledged his continued support, regardless of his location. Connect Church has been Wentz's spiritual home.
""First and foremost, Carson and Madison (his wife), are continually committed to doing what we do here,"" said Horner, a former standout quarterback at Cherokee High School where he played for his father Jim Horner. ""I think for me it speaks to the heart of who Carson and Madison are. After being transitioned to another city, that they still love the people of Philadelphia so much that they want to make sure that people from all walks of life continue to get fed and uplifted by God's love.
""For me, that speaks so highly of the character of both of them,"" Horner continued. ""It's the reflection of the man that Carson really is.""
'Everyone has a need'
Horner noted that Thy Kingdom Crumb was a ""vision that was birthed out of church and Carson and AO1 partnered with us and have continued to do so."" They are committed to continuing to roll the food truck out, he said, and bring quality food and fun and ""the love of God into the greater Philadelphia area.""
Thy Kingdom Crumb's (TKC's) headquarters is based at 1800 Marlton Pike in Cherry Hill at the former location of Rockhill restaurant. It has a commercial kitchen, commissary and offices there.
Anyone who asks can get a meal. The organization's services are not based on income because ""everyone has a need, whether it's emotional, physical or spiritual,"" Horner said previously.
The nonprofit often goes into areas where there are socioeconomic challenges and where people face food insecurity, but Thy Kingdom Crumb also shows up at area colleges and has made stops at Lincoln Financial Field.
""Obviously, during the pandemic season, we've had to adjust how we brought that kind of expression into local communities,"" Horner said. ""You can't have a food truck and people standing outside in the midst of what we were going through. For six months or so, we did food boxes. Boxes of groceries, toilet paper, all the stuff that people needed in the early parts of the pandemic that were difficult to find. Our partners were fantastic in helping us find all that.""
TKC food truck has transitioned to doing hot food again in the last few months with focus on family meals that are put together in larger boxes. People drive through and pick up the food, which is then placed in their trunks.
Distributions during the pandemic have been organized at The Connect Church's Cherry Hill campus at 1110 South Cornell Ave., off Route 70. The area has a large parking lot and enables them to also follow all the safety protocols, Horner noted.
""Everything's contactless, still,"" said Horner, who played football at the University of Tennessee and the University of Richmond. ""We place the boxes in there. They're filled with food, bread, a book, drinks, desserts. What we plan is four to six people for every meal ... In the future, we're planning on bringing the food truck back out into neighborhoods all over. We've been to Delaware, all of over Philly, all over South Jersey.""
His castle's for sale, but he's still giving away hugs
There had been trade rumors about Wentz for a while, and those rumors became a reality in February.
With the trade, Wentz is on the move, which means new digs. According to the Indianapolis Star, Wentz's 7500-plus square foot, five bedroom home on an 11-acre plot in Salem County is listed at $1.7 million. The listing says Woodstown, although it's technically Upper Pittsgrove.
The home features a copper-style farmhouse sink, barn house sliding doors, a bonus hunting room and a terrace that features an outdoor kitchen, heated pool and views of a pond, the listing states. It calls it a ""masterpiece of modern mixed with mountain style living,""  about 30 miles from Philadelphia.
Wentz may be moving hundreds of miles away but TKC should be just fine.
""From our perspective, other than Carson's location changing, nothing's really changing,"" Horner said. ""... We want people to feel hugged. We want them to feel seen, valued. Everybody has needs. It's the core value of TKC.
""That's why for us it's not about a socioeconomic distribution,"" he continued. ""It really is about having an opportunity to share the love of Jesus with people in our community through food.""",Wentz's food truck rolls on with his support
93,"Mar. 2DENVER  If Ja'Wuan James shows up to Broncos training camp a man on a mission, in tip-top shape and dispensing justice on the offensive line, super.
Keep him around these hills for another season.
Anything less than awesomeness, and it's time for the expensive and no-show right tackle to go.
""(James) has a lot of work to do to get where he needs to be, and I know he'll do that,"" standout left tackle Garett Bolles said last season.
I don't know he'll do that. Do you? Nobody here has seen James do that. Two years into a contract worth $51 million when he signed it, James has earned roughly $272,222 for each of the 63 snaps he's taken as a Bronco.
I know, right? How do these guys ever survive?
If there have been worse free-agent signings in team history, you can count them on one hand.
While way too much of the country celebrates not working, not going to school, not living or not competing, new Broncos general manager George Paton can signal there's a new standard in town by cutting James. Doesn't need to be now. Wait till camp. Find out if James is all-in.
And if he's not the powerful right tackle John Elway envisioned when he made James the second-highest paid player on the Broncos roster, Paton can send a message that would be welcomed at UCHealth Training Center by eating the $10 million check James would be owed.
Consider the James deal a sunk cost. Move on.
Shoot, look what the Las Vegas Raiders did Tuesday. Jon Gruden cut the three players who opted out of the 2020 season due to concerns over the NFL's COVID-19 season. That's not coincidence, no way. That's saying if you're not here to work, this will not be your workplace.
The Broncos need workers who desire to be in the workplace. They should use a second- or third-round pick on a tackle, regardless, with North Dakota State's Dillon Radunz, Northwestern's Rashawn Slater and Notre Dame's Liam Eichenberg at the top of the list.
(That's what resident offensive lineman expert and Super Bowl 50 champion Ryan Harris of Altitude Sports Radio told me. I have no idea.)
James appeared in only three games in 2019 due to injury, then opted out of the 2020 season while citing coronavirus concerns.
I wrote it then and I'll repeat it now: NFL players were safer in the NFL bubble than out on their own. And that prediction played out with the final numbers on COVID-19 in the NFL: Out of 959,860 tests administered from Aug. 1 through Super Bowl week, 262 players and 464 other staffers confirmed positive. That's a positivity rate of .08 percent, according to chief medical officer Dr. Allen Sills. That's far lower than the national average of 6.8 percent. That's success. Players were exponentially ""safer"" if they played than if they didn't, and that was so predictable.
At least in this space that was predictable. But from James to Rockies millionaire Ian Desmond, athletes opting out of going to work are met by talking heads with a collective good for him.
Huh? When did bailing on your team become a noble act? Gimme a break. But hey, things must be pretty good these days if a man can choose to not work and still afford to pay the bills.
Broncos players were not happy when James opted out. Credit Bolles for finally saying it.
""He (James) knows what he has to do to get back into the room, and he knows what he has to do to earn our trust back,"" Bolles said.
But they were downright thrilled when Bolles himself made big money the old-fashioned way.
He earned it.
""I'm 100 percent all-Garett Bolles, man,"" Dalton Risner said.
The locker room always knows. One lineman endured three years of boos and holding jokes and came out a richer man for it. Another took the easy way out. Teammates gravitate to the former, not the latter, and here's a hunch Broncos players in camp will have their eyes on James  and Paton, the new general manager, whose decision on James will speak volumes.

94,"Health insurance companies today can legally charge smokers up to 50% more in premiums than non-smokers, based on the simple fact that smokers have made a dangerous lifestyle choice. As the latest surge in the coronavirus pandemic ravages America -- especially those portions of America where misguided ideological rejection of science has spurred people to refuse the vaccine -- some advocates are calling for making the willfully unvaccinated pay higher insurance rates to cover the costs they're incurring in the health care system.

Monday's full regulatory approval of the Pfizer vaccine strengthens that argument.

One of the important reforms under the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) is that it prevents health-insurance companies from refusing coverage or charging higher rates to people with preexisting medical conditions. But Obamacare specifically allows higher premiums for smokers. This makes sense because, unlike a preexisting medical condition, smoking is a choice -- and a potentially costly one for everyone else in the insurance pool.

Resurgent coronavirus infections, led by the delta variant, are now causing a full pandemic resurgence. Infection and death rates are rising dramatically even though vaccine rejection has become a political badge of honor in certain areas. Hospital beds are filling. Alabama, a national hotbed of vaccine obstinance, is completely out of intensive care unit beds.

Almost all the new illnesses and deaths are among the unvaccinated. With vaccines now widely available and free of charge, virtually every adult who remains unvaccinated today has done so by choice.

The only sliver of justification for the holdouts (and it is a sliver) was that the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the vaccines was done on a fast-track emergency basis -- necessary to get the vaccines out there as soon as possible. But it has had the unfortunate effect of allowing some critics to claim, falsely, that the approval process was somehow inadequate.

In any case, that argument is now moot, with the FDA's approval of Pfizer-BioNTech's two-dose vaccine. That and the anticipated approval of other vaccines means many universities and hospitals, along with the U.S. military, will soon require proof of vaccination for employees, students and service members. Private businesses will have a stronger case to require vaccination of employees and patrons -- and red-state politicians who have moved to prohibit such requirements will no longer have even the weakest of justifications.

Allowing the insurance industry to charge higher premiums for the unvaccinated would likely require changing the rules governing Obamacare, which would mean a major fight in Congress. It would be a fight worth having. The sooner society stops treating this pandemic as a culture-war skirmish and starts treating it as the public-health crisis it is, the better.

The Company realized $2.6 million of the $5.8 million recognized as fee income from the Paycheck Protection Program during the year.
Total assets were $1.6 billion, an increase of 29% from the previous year-end. Net loans were $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2020, which included $135 million of the original $173 million in loans related to the PPP (22% were forgiven/repaid during 2020). Asset quality remains strong with non-performing assets and Other Real Estate Owned representing only 0.08% of total assets as of December 31, 2020.
Non-interest-bearing deposits were $371 million, representing 26% of total deposits as of December 31, 2020. Total deposits as of December 31, 2020 were $1.4 billion, and core deposits represent a healthy 72% of total deposits.
""The strong year-end results can be attributed to the Bank's breakneck performance in response to the pandemic, both at the start and throughout the entire year,"" said Abdul Hersiburane, President of MainStreet Bank. ""The Bank worked with all borrowers in order to assist, where prudent, with providing meaningful liquidity through the Paycheck Protection Plan, the Main Street Lending Program, payment deferrals and/or shifting to interest-only payments for a period.""
With the hospitality industry being most hard-hit, the team worked closely throughout the year with the 14 operating hotels in the Bank's portfolio. Since April 2020, monthly Smith Travel Research reports for the portfolio of hotels showed favorable trends for occupancy. As of January 2021, all previously reported borrowers with payment deferrals are scheduled to be back to making monthly payments.
The Company analyzed the loan portfolio and made a special pandemic provision to the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses on June 30, 2020 in the amount of $4.5 million. That special provision included a $1.76 million loan outstanding for one Commercial & Industrial (C&I) borrower that was immediately and fully impacted by the pandemic, $2.0 million for commercial borrowers with potential liquidity concerns and $760,000 for the indirect auto portfolio.
""At its outset, we didn't have a good sense of the pandemic's potential to affect the U.S. Economy or our market,"" said Jeff W. Dick, Chairman & CEO of MainStreet Bancshares Inc. and MainStreet Bank. ""As the year progressed, through a combination of federal programs and regulatory easing, our borrower's collective confidence started to return. The vaccine approval announcements in December gave confirmation that the end was in sight. As a result of the significant changes in data and information available, we determined it would be prudent to update our special pandemic loan loss provision.""
The Company released $3.15 million from the Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses at year-end, as recapped in the table below.

(1)


The Bank recovered $1.498 million of a loan charged-off earlier in the year.




(2)


The indirect loan portfolio losses for the year were less than previous years, so $500,000 was released from the special pandemic provision for indirect loans.




(3)


The Company reclassified approximately $60 million in investor-owned commercial real estate loans as loans held for sale. The loan sale should take place in the first quarter of 2021 and the Company released the associated provision to the ALLL prior to year-end 2020.



The $2.0 million that was previously allocated to commercial borrowers remains intact for the pandemic provision to the ALLL as of December 31, 2020.

","MainStreet Bancshares, Inc. Reports Record Earnings"
96,"Apr. 20 - It wasn't conventional and it wasn't always pretty, but the Lions got it done.
Valley Christian Academy completed a football season.
The 8-man Lions played three games this spring, hosting a pair and traveling to Trona in San Bernardino County for one of the most unique football experiences in the state.
The Lions went 2-1, completing their slate with a 22-0 win over Sun Valley North Valley Military Institute on Saturday.
The Lions took the opportunity to honor their three seniors in that game: Timmy Trenkle, Matthew Holihan and Greg Smith.
Getting any games in was especially difficult for a small school like VCA, which plays 8-man football. The school has an enrollment of about 50 students. Pete Fortier, the school's coach and athletic director, said he had 19 boys on the team this spring, which is a typical turnout.
Finding suitable opponents was the toughest aspect of a COVID-19-impacted season.
""There were more Division 1 schools playing than D2 schools and with no playoffs it made for a challenge to find games,"" Fortier said. ""Even trying to schedule for next year has been difficult because some schools aren't playing. But we were fortunate to get this game Saturday. This school called me a week ago, we scheduled it and we beat 'em.""
The Lions played two home games, beating Hesperia Sage Oak 22-0 in their first home game, but they also traveled to Trona High School and played at their notorious homefield known as 'The Pit.'
It's an all-dirt field.
""That was an experience,"" Fortier said. The Lions lost 56-14.
""I've coached quite a few years and it's the first time I've ever played on a sand field like that. The was just crazy,"" Fortier added. ""Their coach's play sheet blew across the field.""
Fortier said the wind was so bad, in fact, that even on fourth-and-long he opted to go for it, noting that a punt would sail a few yards behind the punter.
""There were lots of scrapes,"" from the dirt, Fortier said. ""Our QB, Sean Swain, right away we had to patch his leg up because he was bleeding. The sand wasn't real fine, it had some gravel, and the guys had sand in their pants and in their shirts. It was an experience.""
A grass field is difficult to maintain out in the arid desert at Trona. The dirt field is watered and leveled before games. Lines are added, though Fortier said they were blown away by the wind before the game started.
In the Lions' game Saturday, VCA was able to send its three seniors off with a convincing win.
Trenkle booted a school-record 43-yard field goal and also had two touchdowns, one on a reception and the other on a rush. He had two catches for 75 yards. On defense, Trenkle also had 12 tackles and a sack.
Smith had three sacks and six tackles against NVMI. Jacob Sanders and Noah List, both freshmen, had interceptions.
Swain, the sophomore quarterback, was injured early after completing 3-of-6 passes for 84 yards and a score. He also rushed for 29 yards.
Josiah Heller had six carries for 89 yards and a touchdown.
Now VCA will turn its attention to the other spring sports that are currently happening. It'll be a unique spring for the Lions, who, with limited enrollment, have just about every athlete playing multiple sports.
Fortier said they'll play some boys basketball and baseball and split a softball season and a girls basketball season.
""We're planning on doing both boys basketball and baseball, and the girls will split, with softball in the first half of the season and basketball in the second half,"" Fortier said.
The boys will ""probably be doing mostly baseball,"" he added, saying Cuyama Valley will be doing boys and girls basketball only this school year and San Luis Obispo Classical Academy is doing boys basketball.
""Shandon is only doing softball, we have four teams in the league for softball and we have four basketball teams,"" Fortier said. ""Coastal Christian, us, Cuyama and SLOCA.""
The VCA girls basketball team will have some non-league games with Santa Maria and possibly Bishop Diego.
Coastal Christian, Cuyama and VCA are the only Coast Valley League schools that will field girls basketball teams.
""Maricopa isn't playing anything this year,"" Fortier said. ""Coast Union is only doing baseball, softball and soccer.""
""This has definitely been an interesting year,"" Fortier added. ""It felt different at first, but once you start getting back to playing some games you almost feel like you're getting back to normal. It was definitely a good feeling.""
",VCA football ends unconventional season with a win
99,"Prevalence of highly transmissible variants of the coronavirus, coupled with increasing travel and pandemic fatigue, has led to a steady increase in new COVID-19 cases in Maine and many other states.
Evidence is growing that Maine and the United States are at the front end of yet another surge of COVID-19 cases that could jeopardize progress made on vaccinations.
With 283 new cases reported Thursday, the highest daily total in nearly two months, Maine’s seven-day daily case average increased to 232. It has not been that high since Feb. 9.
Over the past 15 days, cases have risen to more than 200 on 10 days. Over the previous 15 days, that happened only three times.
Asked Thursday what might be behind the current surge, Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, called it a “$64,000 question.” He said states are starting to see larger shares of coronavirus variants, especially Florida and Michigan, although Massachusetts is catching up.
The other reason is that more people are traveling, some to states where restrictions have been softened.
“Which of those is really the main driver?” Shah said. “That’s what some epidemiologists across the country are trying to find out.”
Maine has detected 15 cases of the variant known as B.1.1.7 that was first detected in the United Kingdom, but the actual number of cases is almost certainly higher because only 5% of positive COVID-19 cases are sequenced to determine if they are, in fact, a variant.
“The variants are here,” Gov. Janet Mills said. “They are spreading to every region of the state and they are more transmissible and potentially more dangerous.”
As a way to stay ahead of those variants, Mills announced Thursday she was moving up vaccine eligibility for all adults to next Wednesday. Already, the date had been moved ahead from May 1 a few weeks ago.
Maine is not alone. More than half of all states have seen their cases increase by at least 10% over the past week, according to data analysis by Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The United States as a whole has reported an average of 65,000 new cases in the last seven days, according to U.S. CDC, which is an increase of about 10,000 cases per day from two weeks ago.
Vermont had its greatest single-day total of the pandemic last week, 283, and its seven-day case average of 178 cases has reached the same levels as the post-holiday surge in January.
New Hampshire’s trajectory has been similar to Maine’s with the daily average creeping up to about 380 this week after bottoming out near 200 cases this time last month.
Michigan, where more than 1,000 cases of the U.K. variant have been detected, has been especially hard hit and has seen its daily average increase to about 5,400 cases — levels not seen since mid-December.
National health experts have been sounding the alarm in recent days as data shows more people are traveling, including young people for spring break last month, and more states are easing pandemic restrictions.
Maine relaxed indoor and outdoor gathering limits last week and allowed bars and tasting rooms to open. Additionally, residents from all New England states can visit without having to quarantine or provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test. The state does still have other safety measures in place, including a mask mandate in public.
Cases are showing up more frequently among young people. Bates College in Lewiston has imposed a “temporary, campuswide, in-room restriction” to address 34 active student cases. This has resulted in 50 others being forced to quarantine. Cases have also been increasing within the University of Maine System.
Dr. Jane Carreiro, dean of the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine in Biddeford, said she believes COVID-19 fatigue is more to blame for the spike.
“They are letting down some of their defenses and things they were doing,” she said. “The good news is: Hopefully this motivates people to go and get vaccinated.”
Carreiro also said that as the spring wears on and summer approaches, case numbers would not be the most important metric. If hospitalizations and deaths decline, she said, cases alone are not as much a problematic.
Hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have yet to rise with cases, but throughout the pandemic, there has been a lag of at least two weeks, so it is too early to tell if that will happen this time.
Health experts are hopeful that those numbers will not increase substantially, reasoning that many of those who have been vaccinated are older and therefore at greater risk of hospitalization or death.
Still, there are about 40,000 people in the hospital with COVID-19 nationwide. And although deaths have dropped to fewer than 1,000 people per day for the first time since November, COVID-19 is still among the leading causes of death.
In Maine, there have been two days over the past week on which five deaths have been reported.
Hospitalizations, meanwhile, have been steady for the past two weeks, ranging from a low of 71 to a high of 80. On Thursday, there were 74 people at Maine hospitals with COVID-19, including 20 in critical care and five on ventilators.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. CDC, was emotional this week when discussing the current trend.
“I’m going to reflect on the recurring feeling I have of impending doom,” she said during a White House briefing. “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope. But right now, I’m scared.”

101,"The city of Aurora and some small business owners in Lake and Cook counties are among recipients of $8.4 million in state funds aimed to help communities rebuild from looting that followed the George Floyd protests in the spring of 2020.
The Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity announced this week that Aurora received a $1.2 million grant from the Rebuild Distressed Communities program to ""support capital investment in commercial corridors that have experienced property damage.""
""During the civil unrest that unfolded in the summer of 2020, 85 businesses and organizations throughout the City of Aurora were the victims of burglaries, criminal damage, and arsons,"" said Aurora Police Chief Keith Cross in a statement.
""This grant will allow us to protect our businesses, residents and visitors into the future and will provide real-time information that will help direct the daily response of our public safety personnel.""
To qualify, projects must take place on the same block and surrounding area where businesses were most affected.
The Aurora grant came from $7.45 million assigned to seven commercial corridors across the state.
In addition to the money provided to communities, the state commerce department provided $976,000 in aid to 26 small businesses across the state, including a hair and beauty supply store in Lake Villa.
Melissa Hampton, owner of Beauty City in the Lake Plaza shopping center, said the $1,421 grant she received helped pay for repairs to the store’s entrance damaged during looting.
""They only talk about Chicago, but Waukegan was hit really bad when the looting started,"" said Hampton, who’s been in business for 24 years.
She said her business was vandalized three times over the course of the summer of 2020 and removed the plywood boarded up in her store windows only at the end of that year.
Beauty City, which specializes in hair extension and wigs for cancer patients and people with hair loss, has also struggled from the ongoing pandemic.
Hampton said her business has recovered about 60% to 70% since the COVID-19 crisis began in March 2020.
""I’m trying to ride this (omicron) wave out,"" she said.
Most of the small-business grants went to companies in Chicago, but Master Wireless-26 Kedzie Inc.in Waukegan received $20,400, and Dr. Zhivago, a restaurant in Skokie, received $4,085.

103,"Dr. Anthony Fauci walked back his prediction Monday that it will take the United States more than one year to get control of COVID-19.
During an appearance on CNN, President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser offered an apology and said he meant to say the goal is actually within reach sooner — the spring of 2022 instead of the fall of next year as he said earlier in the day — but only if people holding out on getting vaccinated decide to get the jab.
""No, Anderson, I have to apologize,"" he told anchor Anderson Cooper. ""When I listened to the tape, I meant to say the spring of 2022, so I did misspeak. And in the conversation with Mary Louise Kelly, she was saying, when do I think we can get some control? I said if we can get through this winter and get really the overwhelming majority of the 90 million people who have not been vaccinated, vaccinated, I hope we could start to get some good control in the spring of 2022. I didn't mean the fall. I misspoke, my bad.""
https://twitter.com/DailyCaller/status/1429960085162401798
Earlier, on NPR, Fauci made the comment about the fall of 2022. He said it was contingent on widespread vaccinations, a contentious issue lingering more than eight months after the jabs became available to the public, as the more contagious delta variant causes a new spike in cases and health officials push for booster shots.
""If all things go the way we want them to go,"" Fauci, longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, began in a quote aired on CNN, ""and we get really the overwhelming majority of people vaccinated. I think as we get into the fall and winter, we could start to really get some good control over this as we get back into the fall of 2022.""
In answering Cooper's follow-up question about what he meant by getting ""control"" of the virus, Fauci said it translated to a ""degree of overall blanket protection of the community"" that could see a return to ""a degree of normality, namely reassuming the things that we were hoping we could do. Restaurants, theaters, that kind of thing.""
When pressed, Fauci did not define what percentage of the population would have to get vaccinated to get the pandemic under control. 
""In all transparency and honesty, we don't know that because we have not been to the point where we got there, then fell below and then see the virus come back,"" he said.
He also warned of more variants, saying, ""Lingering without getting those people vaccinated should be vaccinated"" could lead to complications that disrupt his predicted timeline to normalcy.
The Food and Drug Administration granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech two-dose COVID-19 vaccine on Monday, a move the Biden administration hopes will convince holdouts to get the shots. Moderna, whose vaccine relies on the same mRNA technology as the one developed by Pfizer, filed its application for full approval in June, and it is expected to be granted this fall. 
Pfizer and Moderna are testing the vaccines in young children, with clinical trial data expected to be submitted to the FDA in the fall. Right now, there is no COVID-19 vaccine available for children 12 and under.
CONTROVERSY SURROUNDS EIGHT STATES THAT PROHIBIT SCHOOL MASK MANDATES
More than 171 million people have been fully vaccinated in the U.S., which is 51.5% of the population, according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than 201 million, or roughly 60.8% of the population, have received at least one dose. 
In recent weeks, there has been renewed debate about restrictions meant to stem the spread of the virus, and schools are grappling with whether to require face coverings in schools as students return to class. Roughly 6 in 10 people in the U.S. say they support students and teachers should be required to wear masks while in K-12 schools, and similar numbers were reported for vaccine mandates among those eligible, according to a poll from the Associated Press/NORC Center for Public Affairs Research reported on Monday.

The CDC said the vaccines are key to controlling the coronavirus pandemic and stressed that infections among fully vaccinated people, called breakthrough cases, are expected.
""COVID-19 vaccines are effective and are a critical tool to bring the pandemic under control. However, no vaccines are 100% effective at preventing illness in vaccinated people. There will be a small percentage of fully vaccinated people who still get sick, are hospitalized, or die from COVID-19,"" the CDC states on its website.

EPA has determined that these revisions satisfy all requirements needed for program approval. This action also codifies EPA's approval of Arkansas's State program and incorporates by reference those provisions of the State regulations that we have determined meet the requirements for approval. The provisions will be subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under Subtitle I of RCRA sections 9005 and 9006 and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:I. Approval of Revisions to Arkansas's Underground Storage Tank ProgramA. Why are revisions to State programs necessary?States which have received final approval from the EPA under RCRA section 9004(b), 42 U.S.C. 6991c(b), must maintain an underground storage tank program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal underground storage tank program. When EPA makes revisions to the regulations that govern the UST program, States must revise their programs to comply with the updated regulations and submit these revisions to the EPA for approval. Changes to State UST programs may be necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, States must change their programs because of changes to the EPA's regulations in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 280. States can also initiate changes on their own to their underground storage tank program and these changes must then be approved by EPA.B. What decisions has the EPA made in this rule?On October 17, 2018, in accordance with 40 CFR 281.51(a), Arkansas submitted a complete program revision application seeking approval for its UST program revisions corresponding to the EPA final rule published on July 15, 2015 (80 FR 41566), which finalized revisions to the 1988 UST regulations and to the 1988 State program approval (SPA) regulations. As required by 40 CFR 281.20, the State submitted the following: A transmittal letter from the Governor requesting approval, a description of the program and operating procedures, a demonstration of the State's procedures to ensure adequate enforcement, a Memorandum of Agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities of the EPA and the implementing agency, a statement of certification from the Attorney General, and copies of all relevant State statutes and regulations.We have reviewed the application and the revisions to Arkansas's UST program and determined they are no less stringent than the corresponding Federal requirements in subpart C of 40 CFR part 281, and the Arkansas program provides for adequate enforcement of compliance (40 CFR 281.11(b)). Therefore, the EPA grants Arkansas final approval to operate its UST program with the changes described in the program revision application, and as outlined below in Section I.G of this document. The Arkansas Department of Environmental Quality (ADEQ) is the lead implementing agency for the UST program in Arkansas, except in Indian country.C. What is the effect of this approval decision?This action does not impose additional requirements on the regulated community because the regulations being approved by this rule are already effective in the State of Arkansas, and they are not changed by this action. This action merely approves the existing State regulations as meeting the Federal requirements and renders them federally enforceable.D. Why is EPA using a direct final rule?The EPA is publishing this direct final rule without a prior proposed rule because we view this as a noncontroversial action and anticipate no adverse comment. Arkansas received comments during its comment period when the rules and regulations in this document were being considered and were proposed at the State level. All comments were addressed at public hearing and/or reflected in the adopted regulations.E. What happens if the EPA receives comments that oppose this action?Along with this direct final rule, the EPA is publishing a separate document in the ""Proposed Rules"" section of this Federal Register that serves as the proposal to approve the State's UST program revision, providing opportunity for public comment. If EPA receives comments that oppose this approval, EPA will withdraw the direct final rule by publishing a document in the Federal Register before the rule becomes effective. The EPA will base any further decision on the approval of the State program changes on the proposal to approve after considering all comments received during the comment period. EPA will then address all public comments in a later final rule. You may not have another opportunity to comment. If you want to comment on this approval, you must do so at this time.F. For what has Arkansas previously been approved?On February 24, 1995, EPA finalized a rule approving the UST program submitted by Arkansas in lieu of the Federal program. On January 18, 1996, EPA codified the approved Arkansas program that is subject to EPA's inspection and enforcement authorities under RCRA sections 9005 and 9006, 42 U.S.C. 6991d and 6991e, and other applicable statutory and regulatory provisions.G. What changes are we approving with this action?In order to be approved, the program must provide for adequate enforcement of compliance as described in 40 CFR 281.11(b) and part 281, subpart D. The ADEQ has broad statutory authority to regulate the installation, operation, maintenance, closure of USTs, and UST releases under the following: Arkansas Code Annotated (ACA), Title 8, Environmental Law; Chapter 1, General Provisions; Subchapter 1 General Provisions section 8-1-107; Subchapter 2 Powers of the Department and the Commission section 8-1-202; Chapter 4 Waste and Air Pollution Control Act; Subchapter 1 sections 8-4-103(d)(1)(A) and (d)(3)(A)-(d)(4)(A); Subchapter 2 Water Pollution section 8-4-224; Chapter 7 Hazardous Substances; Subchapter 8 Regulated Substance Storage Tanks; and Subchapter 9 Petroleum Storage Tank Trust Fund Act.Specific authorities to regulate the installation, operation, maintenance, closure of USTs, and UST releases are found under Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission (APC&EC) Regulation Number 12 Storage Tanks, sections Reg. 12.101 through 12.1002 as amended effective August 24, 2018. The aforementioned regulations satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR 281.40 and 281.41.The Arkansas DEQ's Office of Land Resources (OLR) provides notice and opportunity for public comment on all proposed rules. The OLR investigates and requires petroleum storage tank owners and operators to provide notice about contaminants and submissions of final remediation plans. Requirements for public participation and notification can be found in the ACA at sections 8-4-224 and 8-7-803, as well as in Regulation No. 12 at section 12.104 which incorporates the Federal 40 CFR 280.67 by reference and Regulation No. 8 at section 8.604. Arkansas has met the public participation requirements found in 40 CFR 281.42.To qualify for final approval, a State's program must be ""no less stringent"" than the Federal program in all elements of the revised EPA final rule published on July 15, 2015 (80 FR 41566). EPA added new operation and maintenance requirements and addressed UST systems deferred in the 1988 UST regulations. The changes also added secondary containment requirements for new and replaced tank and piping, operator training requirements, periodic operation and maintenance requirements for UST systems, and requirements to ensure UST system compatibility before storing certain biofuel blends. It removed past deferrals for emergency generator tanks, field constructed tanks and airport hydrant systems.The ADEQ made updates to their regulations to ensure that they were no less stringent than the Federal regulations which were revised on July 15, 2015 (80 FR 41566). Title 40 CFR 281.30 through 281.39 contains the ""no less stringent than"" criteria that a State must meet in order to have its UST program approved. In the State's application for approval of its UST program, the Arkansas Assistant Attorney General certified that it meets the requirements listed in 40 CFR 281.30 through 281.39. EPA has relied on this certification in addition to the analysis submitted by the State in making our determination. For further information on EPA's analysis of the State's application, see the Technical Support Document (TSD) contained in the docket for this rulemaking. The corresponding State regulations are as follows:Title 40 CFR 281.30 lists the Federal requirements for new UST system design, construction, installation, and notification with which a State must comply in order to be found to be no less stringent than Federal requirements. APC&EC Regulation No. 12 Storage Tanks, section 12.104 incorporates the necessary elements of 40 CFR 280 by reference. Additionally, the State includes requirements for notification and notification reporting at APC&EC Regulation No. 12 Storage Tanks, section 12.201(A), requiring UST system owners and operators to notify the implementing agency of any new UST systems, including instances where one assumes ownership of an existing UST.Title 40 CFR 281.31 requires that most existing UST systems meet the requirements of 281.30, are upgraded to prevent releases for their operating life due to corrosion, spills, or overfills, or are permanently closed.

109,"As the rate of Covid-19 vaccinations climbed and new infection numbers plummeted in spring, many Americans thought they were in for a carefree summer. 
But lagging vaccinations and a highly contagious new variant dragged the US back into a vicious Covid-19 surge -- one that's prompted new mask mandates and measures and still shows no signs of slowing down.
The rise in cases is being driven by unvaccinated Americans -- who health officials say also make up most of hospitalized Covid-19 patients and deaths across the country. Fueling the surge is the dangerous Delta variant, a strain so contagious that those who were not previously infected or have not been vaccinated will likely get it, said Scott Gottlieb, the head of the Food and Drug Administration in the Trump administration.
If America doesn't vaccinate a large enough number of its population to help crush this outbreak, the surge could become the country's worst yet, some experts warn.
""This surge that we're going through right now has every potential to be -- and already looks to be -- the worst surge we've faced so far,"" former US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in a live online interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday.
But we don't have to get there. Health officials say the key to quickly turning things around is getting more shots into arms.
""If we work together, unify as a country, vaccinate everyone who is interested and unvaccinated, and put our masks on to prevent disease, we could really control this in a matter of weeks,"" US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told CNN on Thursday.
If that doesn't happen, Walensky warned, the US could soon be seeing the same levels of daily cases it did back in January -- several hundred thousand daily.
Here's where we are now.
Average cases have increased nine-fold since early July
As of Friday, America's seven-day average of daily Covid-19 cases was more than 107,100 -- the highest average in nearly six months, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
The last time average daily cases topped 100,000 was February 11. Average daily cases have seen a nine-fold increase since early July.
Most of the cases are coming from areas with low vaccination rates, White House Covid-19 response coordinator Jeff Zients said in a Covid-19 briefing on Monday. A third of all US cases in the previous week came from Florida and Texas, he said.
""The frustrating part is this is all preventable,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told CNN's Pamela Brown on Thursday. ""Had we really accelerated throughout May and June and fully vaccinated the country ... we wouldn't have to worry about this so much.""
Surges have been particularly steep across the South, including in Florida and Louisiana, where Walensky said Thursday there have been ""exponential rises"" in cases that don't look like they've reached their peak just yet.
Hospitalizations are highest since February
More than 66,000 Americans were hospitalized with Covid-19 across the country as of late Saturday, according to data from the US Department of Health and Human Services.
America's Covid-19 hospitalizations haven't been this high since February.
""Today we find ourselves retracing our steps towards the edge of a cliff. It is very conceivable that we could once again be heading toward a public health catastrophe,"" Harris County, Texas, Judge Lina Hidalgo said in a news conference on Thursday. In that conference, Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner announced the Texas Medical Center campus in Houston had admitted more than 300 Covid-19 patients in a day.
Florida, which leads the nation in the number of adults and children hospitalized for Covid-19, had 12,373 adults and 143 children hospitalized Thursday, according to CDC data.
Data published Friday by the Florida Department of Health showed the state reported a record 134,506 new Covid-19 cases over the past week, for an average of 19,215 cases each day. The previous record high was on January 8, with 125,937 total cases reported over seven days, for an average of 17,991 cases each day, according to data from Johns Hopkins.
Louisiana officials reported Friday a record 2,421 people hospitalized with Covid-19 statewide -- beating the state's previous record that was set just a day earlier. Of the state's hospitalized patients roughly 91% are unvaccinated, officials said earlier in the week.
Last week, Arkansas reported a record low of 25 ICU beds available across the state. In Mississippi, health officials said Wednesday only six ICU beds were available.
Child and teen Covid-19 cases jumped 84% in a week 
Nearly 72,000 new child Covid-19 cases were reported in the week between July 22 and July 29, the American Academy of Pediatrics reported on Tuesday -- a substantial increase from the previous week, when about 39,000 cases were reported, and nearly five times what was being reported at the end of June. The definition of a child varies by state but generally includes those up to ages 17 or 18.
""I don't think this virus is necessarily targeting kids or adolescents, I think what's happened is, I think what you're seeing across the South right now is a forest fire, and everything is getting swept up in it, including adolescents, including younger kids,"" Hotez told CNN on Thursday.
""The way you stop that is you get as many people vaccinated,"" he added. ""The more you can vaccinate, you can actually slow transmission.""
The alarming rise comes as schools across the country prepare to welcome students back to class, while navigating the safest way forward. With children under 12 years old still ineligible for a shot, some states are requiring students to mask up -- while others have banned school mask mandates. 
Leaders across the country are taking different steps to help protect America's youngest. Utah Gov. Spencer Cox said the state will give away KN-95 masks to children and Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called a special session of the Arkansas Legislature to amend a law passed to ""end mandatory face covering requirements."" He said he regretted signing the bill, adding that local school districts should have the flexibility to add protection for children under 12, who cannot be vaccinated.
On Friday, an Arkansas judge temporarily blocked the enforcement of that law.
Delta variant accounts for 93% of US Covid-19 cases
Behind the country's latest surge is the Delta variant, which now accounts for more than 93% of coronavirus circulating in the US, according to data from the CDC. This includes several sub-lineages of Delta, all of which are classified as variants of concern. The number is even higher in parts of the country including Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska, where Delta accounts for more than 98% of circulating virus.
Those numbers show a rapid increase in the variant's prevalence across the US. In late May, the CDC estimated that Delta made up about 3% of new Covid-19 cases.
An internal document from the CDC last month said the variant appears to cause more severe illness and is about as transmissible as chickenpox.
""This is serious,"" Walensky previously told CNN. ""It's one of the most transmissible viruses we know about.""
Officials across the country have said the Delta variant is fueling their case increases.
Mississippi Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said Thursday the state has seen a ""phenomenal increase"" in daily cases that's ""entirely attributable to the Delta variant, which is sweeping over Mississippi like a tsunami."" Roughly 97% of new cases are among unvaccinated people, Dobbs said.
""We're seeing the unvaccinated in our population driving the current surge. We're seeing about 89% of our hospitalizations and 85% of our deaths are unvaccinated.""
Most Americans live in substantial or high Covid-19 spread areas
More than 97% of Americans live in areas with ""substantial"" or ""high"" Covid-19 transmission, according to CDC data.
The agency said late last month that even fully vaccinated people who live in those areas should wear masks indoors, to prevent further spread of the Delta variant. CDC guidance for unvaccinated people remains that they should continue masking up until they are fully vaccinated.
The ""substantial"" and ""high"" terms are part of the CDC's system that measures the level of community transmission in a county based on two metrics: new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people and the positivity rate.
Experts say knowing how much virus is circulating in a community can help residents understand the kind of risk they're taking when choosing whether to mask up or not.
The good news 
The figures are grim, but there's good news: Covid-19 vaccinations are picking up pace, with an average of more than 464,700 people initiating their vaccinations every day as of Thursday, CDC data shows. That's the highest average daily pace in nearly seven weeks -- and a 19% increase over last week's pace.
And seeing some of the sharpest vaccination increases are several Southern states, which have for months seen poor vaccine progress and heavy vaccine hesitancy. At the end of July, Alabama's average of new doses administered was more than double what it was three weeks before.
Louisiana saw daily vaccination rates jump 111% in the same time frame, while in Missouri daily average vaccinations climbed by 87%.
Roughly 58.5% of the US population has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose and roughly 50.1% is fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.
""The ultimate answer"" to turning around this surge is vaccination, emergency medicine physician Dr. Leana Wen told CNN's Anderson Cooper.
""We know that what will stop the virus in its tracks and really is our only and best way out of the pandemic is to increase our vaccination rates,"" Wen said. ""If we have a high enough level of immunity in the US then we're able to stop this virus from wreaking the type of havoc that it is.""
CNN's Deidre McPhillips and Michael Nedelman contributed to this report.",These 5 figures show how bad the US Covid-19 surge is. But experts say we can turn things around
111,"More than a month after shipments of a promising new COVID-19 treatment started arriving in Minnesota, most of the doses haven't been used even though doctors initially feared demand would far outstrip supply.
State health officials say some medical centers have reported a surprising lack of patient interest in the outpatient antibody therapy, which might help people avoid hospitalization, but requires an hourlong infusion. Health systems also have struggled to create a process for providing the treatment, since resources have been stretched thin as they treat COVID-19 patients and administer coronavirus vaccines.
Still, there is hope that demand will pick up soon along with expanded operations at infusion centers -- Allina Health System launched its program in late December and plans to double capacity in the coming weeks.
""When I signed on as the lead physician for this, I said: 'This is going to be like a floodgate -- I will have like thousands of patients wanting it and I'm going to fall short, "" said Dr. Venkat Iyer, medical director for medical specialties at Allina Health Group. ""… Right now, we have enough supply to give it to people. And the main bottleneck is our capacity to give it -- capacity and staffing.""
The treatment consists of laboratory-made antibodies that are infused in patients and designed to block the pandemic virus from attaching to and entering human cells. The federal government is funding the monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured by two drug companies. President Donald Trump received one version when he tested positive for COVID-19 last year.
The state Health Department says that as of Jan. 5, patients had received just 1,652 infusions out of a statewide supply for 12,448 treatments, a usage rate of 13%. Nationally, only about 20% of available treatments have been infused, said Dr. Sarah Lim, a medical specialist with the Minnesota Department of Health.
""It's been relatively low, but it's increasing,"" Lim said of demand. ""What we're hearing anecdotally from health care systems is that while, in the beginning, they had a lot of patients decline the infusions … they're starting to see the acceptance rate tick upward.""
Early-stage treatment
The treatment is an option only for patients at increased risk of serious illness due to their age or health history, and their symptoms must be mild or moderate. That's been a problem in generating interest, doctors say, since patients offered treatment sometimes question the need for it since they're feeling pretty good.
So far, the state has shipped supplies to 88 infusion centers, 55 of which are up and running, said Alexandra Waterman, the Health Department's medical surge coordinator. Across infusion centers in the Twin Cities -- where hospitals were hit by a wave of COVID-19 patients in November and December -- about 2% of the treatments have been used.
With COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations declining in Minnesota, Waterman said more facilities might come on board. ""With that, they'll be able to also help us with the messaging of: This is out there and this is where you can come to get it.""
She added: ""I think there just hasn't been a lot of public interest because they don't know [about it]. … Everyone is so focused on the vaccine right now.""
Still some skepticism
On Saturday, Minnesota reported 2,489 new coronavirus cases and 43 more deaths due to complications of COVID-19. Although the seven-day rolling average for new cases has been trending up over the past week or so, new infections, deaths and hospitalizations have been well short of peaks in November and December.
Trump's usage of monoclonal antibodies raised the profile of the treatment, but not everyone is a believer. The risk of side effects is low, doctors say, but medical societies have not deemed the treatment as the standard of care for COVID-19 patients, stressing that more information is needed about potential benefits.
At Bloomington-based HealthPartners, clinicians can connect patients to treatments offered through a CVS Health program, but the evidence so far shows the therapy ""hasn't been a home run when it comes to preventing hospitalization and death,"" said Dr. Mark Sannes, an infectious disease specialist. The numbers support ""skepticism,"" Sannes said, although he noted that studies are ongoing.
If the treatment proves effective, ""we'll embrace it and probably incorporate it into our treatment algorithms,"" he said. ""I just don't think we're there yet.""
Doctors at Mayo Clinic, however, have been ""very satisfied and happy with results so far -- very promising,"" said Dr. Raymund Razonable, an infectious disease specialist overseeing the clinic's program for monoclonal antibodies. Across its operations in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Arizona and Florida, Mayo has provided 2,200 treatments so far, and hopes to soon publish data about the impact on hospitalizations, intensive care usage and deaths, Razonable said.
At this point, monoclonal antibodies in Minnesota are not a scarce resource, said Razonable, who called demand for the treatment at Mayo ""steady.""
To be effective, the antibody treatment must be administered within 10 days of symptom onset. That's a challenge, doctors say, since clinics must quickly identify eligible patients among those testing positive and then provide education. The treatment is being provided under an emergency use authorization from federal regulators.
Rationing plans
Working under the initial assumption that supplies would be scarce, health systems developed plans to ethically ration treatment access by randomly selecting patients to receive it. But low demand at the University of Wisconsin has kept doctors from having to do so, said Dr. Peter Newcomer, chief clinical officer at UW Health.
As the availability of hospital beds dwindled late last year, health care workers pushed to provide the treatment, hoping that they could keep roughly 1 in 20 patients from being hospitalized, Newcomer said. But doctors need better data on which high-risk patients eligible for treatment are most likely to benefit, said Dr. Andrew Olson, medical director for COVID-19 Hospital Medicine at M Health Fairview.
The logistical challenge of providing the treatment would be considerable ""even if there wasn't a pandemic,"" Olson said. Fairview opted to create a new infusion center just for COVID-19 patients, since others who need infusion treatments are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus. After providing the therapy, health care workers typically watch patients for an hour in case of side effects.
""If we were able to generate the demand the government hoped for with monoclonal antibodies, you'd have to generate a different solution for how that many patients would receive treatment,"" Olson said. ""This would take funding and collaboration on a different scale than we have seen so far.""

","Effingham COVID deaths rise by 2, vaccines available"
113,"(StatePoint) COVID-19 vaccines are overwhelmingly safe and highly effective at reducing the risk of severe disease, hospitalizations and death. Unfortunately, misinformation and pervasive myths continue to sow doubt, leaving many unprotected.
Roughly 99% of deaths linked to COVID-19 in the latest wave -- and the vast majority of cases involving severe symptoms that require hospitalization -- were among patients who weren’t fully vaccinated, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“With high levels of community spread of COVID-19, we’re once again fighting a two-front war: against the virus and against rampant misinformation,” says American Medical Association president, Gerald E. Harmon, M.D.
Here are some of the top myths physicians are hearing and what you need to know:
--Can COVID-19 vaccines impact fertility? Risks to fertility or the ability to become pregnant after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine were disproven through clinical trials and real-world data points. While pregnant women weren’t specifically targeted for vaccine trials, several participants became pregnant without issue during the trial duration and there’s been no demonstrated real-world impact on fertility. Moreover, COVID-19 itself carries significant risks for pregnant women, including higher risks of preterm labor and stillbirth, and higher risks of hypertension and pneumonia for pregnant women. There’s also no evidence showing that COVID-19 vaccines affect male fertility.
--Can vaccinated people “shed” spike proteins, affecting those close to them? Vaccine shedding can only occur when a vaccine contains a weakened version of the virus. None of the COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the United States contain a live virus, so it’s not biologically possible for a vaccinated person to affect an unvaccinated person by proxy or by “shedding” spike proteins.
--I’ve already had COVID-19. Do I need the vaccine? Yes, the data shows that unvaccinated individuals are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with COVID-19 than those who were fully vaccinated after initially contracting the virus. Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and those around you.
--Why do I need the vaccine if breakthrough infections are possible? Some fully vaccinated people will still get sick because no vaccine is 100% effective. However, data show that vaccination may make COVID-19 symptoms less severe. The vaccines have also been shown to provide substantial protection against death and hospitalization in cases of breakthrough infection.
--I’m young and healthy. Do I really need the vaccine? Many young, previously healthy people have gotten seriously ill or died from COVID-19, and those numbers are increasing with new, more transmissible variants. There’s no way to predict how you’ll respond to infection. Additionally, vaccines help prevent you from carrying the virus and transmitting it to others. Reducing the number of unvaccinated people will mitigate transmission of the virus.
--I have allergies. Should I be worried about a reaction to the vaccine? There have been very rare (2.5-5 people per million) reports of severe (anaphylactic) allergic reactions to COVID-19 vaccines. Having severe allergic reactions to certain foods, bee stings or oral medications doesn’t mean you will have an allergic reaction to a COVID-19 vaccine. The vaccination sites are prepared to evaluate and handle these situations on individual bases.
More fact-based vaccine information can be found by visiting cdc.gov or getvaccineanswers.org.
“The evidence around vaccinations is abundantly clear; they’re safe, effective and will help protect you and your loved ones from severe COVID and death,” says Dr. Harmon. “If you have questions about the vaccine, its safety, or effectiveness, please speak to your physician. We are here for you, eager to answer your questions, and get you protected from this virus.”

117,"Drake coach Darian DeVries said there was no way for his team to avoid the anxiety of the past week. The Bulldogs were one of the NCAA Tournament bubble teams watching conference tournaments after losing to Loyola-Chicago in the Missouri Valley Tournament final a week ago. At the start of the week, their at-large bid was safe. By the end of it, it was set to go down to the wire.  ""We decided that the best way to approach Selection Sunday is to be cautiously optimistic leading up to it,"" DeVries told USA TODAY Sports. ""After a year with postponements and uncertainty because of COVID-19, playing back-to-back games in conference play, there's just a lot you cannot control. In some ways, that prepared us for our postseason (fate) being in the selection committee's hands."" That optimism paid off for Drake, which sneaked into the field of 68 as one of the last teams in – securing a No. 11 seed in a play-in game Thursday against Wichita State. A high win count and NET score in the 40s helped offset a non-conference strength of schedule in the 300s and just one Quadrant 1 victory for the mid-major. The Bulldogs (25-4, 15-3) watched as other bubble teams passed them, but the ones that didn't are now left depleted.  There is a slight chance the ""first four"" teams out could be called upon this year, though, taking special precedence. Under COVID-19 protocols, the 69th, 70th, 71st and 72nd teams will act as stand-by replacements for the tournament. They'd have up until Tuesday to become an alternate if one of the 68 teams cannot meet NCAA requirements in Indianapolis. After that, the bracket is locked. A look at the seven biggest snubs from the field of 68 on Selection Sunday: CAPSULES: West | Midwest | South | East Louisville  The Cardinals' omission is the biggest snub of this year's NCAA Tournament. Coach Chris Mack's team was left out of the field, while ACC rival Syracuse squeezed in. The committee likely noticed Louisville's one Quadrant 1 victory and NET score in the high 50s. The Cardinals (13-7, 8-5) had a game against Virginia Tech canceled on March 3 and then lost to Duke in the second round of the ACC Tournament. Considering how close it was, one loss or, this year, one cancellation proved to be the difference-maker.  Colorado State The Rams (18-6, 14-4 Mountain West) lost to fellow bubble team Utah State in the MWC tournament semifinals, and that's an outcome the committee maybe saw as a de facto elimination game, as Utah State got into the field instead. Colorado State has a NET score in the 50s and one of its two Quadrant 1 wins came against San Diego State, the regular-season and tournament champion in the Mountain West. But it wasn't enough as the committee left out two worthy Mountain West teams.  Saint Louis The Billikens, similar to Drake, had been watching all week while power conference bubble teams vied for at-large bids. Saint Louis (14-6, 6-4 Atlantic 10) was ousted last week in the Atlantic 10 Tournament by tourney team Saint Bonaventure. It was a close call for the committee when examining Saint Louis' credentials, but ultimately, the Billikens posted only two Quadrant 1 wins and their non-conference strength of schedule of 245 offset a NET score in the 40s. The team had multiple stoppages due to COVID-19, but the committee could only allow for some leniency in this area.  Ole Miss The Rebels (16-11, 10-8) barely lost to LSU in the SEC Tournament quarterfinals and that was the difference. Ole Miss' NET score in the 50s was paired with three Quadrant 1 victories. But the issues included a non-conference strength of schedule in the mid-200s and not enough wins.  Duke The Blue Devils (13-11, 9-9 ACC) announced they'd be opting out of the postseason after a positive COVID-19 test kept them from playing Florida State in the ACC Tournament semifinals, effectively ending their pursuit for the league's automatic bid and blocking their pathway for an at-large bid pathway. But due to this year's need for replacement teams, Duke re-entered the mix as a possible consideration. As of Selection Sunday, the committee doesn't have them close. A NET score of 49 and two Quadrant 1 victories are unimpressive, but mostly this team loses a blind résumé test because of its low win count.  Boise State The Broncos (18-8, 14-6 Mountain West) had an interesting case for an at-large bid. Despite only two Quadrant 1 wins and a NET score in the 50s, Boise State owned the second-best non-conference strength of schedule in the country. One red flag for the selection committee, though, was a Quadrant 4 loss to Fresno State that stained Boise State's résumé. Despite losing its last four games, including in the MWC quarterfinals to Nevada, Boise State had fared well against other bubble teams in its conference, splitting with Colorado State and beating Utah State twice.  Memphis The Tigers narrowly lost to Houston in the American Athletic Conference Tournament semifinals and it cost them because their profile was missing a Quadrant 1 win. A NET score in the 50s and non-conference strength of schedule near the 200s offset coach Penny Hardaway's group that surged at the end of the season – winning seven of their last nine and only losing to No. 2 seed Houston. Memphis' overall body of work just wasn't there based on how it fared earlier in the season. Follow college basketball reporter Scott Gleeson on Twitter @ScottMGleeson.

119,"The Allegheny County Health Department reported 30 new deaths from COVID-19 on Saturday, an increase that included data from as early as December.Of the newly reported fatalities, 23 were from January and two from December, the Health Department said. The most recent occurred Tuesday.
The reports include information imported by the state from its Electronic Death Registration System, the department said. Twelve of the fatalities were associated with long-term care facilities. Two of the deceased were in their 50s; three in their 60s; eight in their 70s; 10 in their 80s; six in their 90s; and one over 100.
Allegheny County has reported 1,527 deaths attributed to COVID-19 since the pandemic reached our region in March.
Reported COVID-19 deaths statewide increased by 157 on Saturday, bringing the total to 22,396, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Total known cases in Pennsylvania climbed by 3,930 for a total of 865,604, the department reported.
The state's daily increase a week ago, by contrast, was 5,191 cases.
Among other statewide figures from the department:
The state's positivity rate - the proportion of those tested who turn up positive for COVID-19 - was 9.3% for Jan. 22-28, down from 10.5% for Jan. 15-21.
Through Friday, just over 1.2 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine had been administered in Pennsylvania. Just more than 696,000 people statewide had received a first vaccine dose, while nearly 266,000 had received two doses and completed the vaccination process. The figures do not include vaccinations administered in Philadelphia or in federal facilities, nor those administered through CVS in a federal pharmacy partnership.
There were 3,041 COVID-19 patients hospitalized Saturday in Pennsylvania, 644 of them in intensive care units. That was down from 3,586 - including 699 in ICUs - a week earlier.
Also Saturday, Allegheny County reported 271 additional cases of COVID-19, the smallest daily increase in at least four days. The county had reported at least 300 new cases a day from Tuesday through Friday. (Monday's report of 402 cases was a two-day tally.)
Those newly reported to be infected range in age from 3 months to 98 years, with a median age of 40, the county Health Department said.
The dates of the positive tests ranged from Dec. 18 to Friday. Fifteen of them were more than a week old. The county has reported 71,083 COVID-19 infections since the pandemic began.
More information about COVID-19 and vaccines can be found on the county's dashboard and the state Department of Health website.

121,"First-year teachers and some hourly employees in Greenville County Schools could see more pay increases next year if the district passes its proposed budget.
Administrators added several new increases to the budget, which was originally discussed at a workshop meeting in March. The proposed budget had already included a minimum 2% pay increase for all employees and raises for hourly staff, but the newest proposal includes more pay increases.
The new budget items would increase the starting salary for entry-level teachers who work four extra days from just under $41,000 to $41,500, as well as raising the minimum hourly pay to $12.93. The lowest hourly pay rate in the district is currently $10.26.
The budget proposal would also move hourly workers to a weekly pay cycle instead of every two weeks. Bus drivers would also receive an additional $10 for every day they drive without causing a wreck, which is up from the current $5 bonus. Nurses would get paid more to work an additional five days in the year.
The total budget is about $714.2 million, but the district is only projecting $691.2 million in revenue, which leaves a shortfall of about $23 million. Superintendent Burke Royster has proposed pulling that money from the district's fund balance to cover the gap rather than raise taxes.
The district has about 15 mills it could use to raise taxes, with one mill equaling about $1.3 million for the school system. Royster has said most of the tax burden would fall on small businesses during a time when they have also been hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is why he recommended against raising taxes.
""I appreciate the careful nature that you guys take in thinking about what are the increases we can sustain, how can we use the money we have and how can we leverage it,"" board member Lisa Wells told administrators at the first reading of the budget Thursday.
As of Feb. 28, the district had a fund balance of just over $260 million, or more than 35% of the total budget. Auditors typically recommend districts reserve about 16% of their budget in the fund balance.
Royster estimates the district will need to use some money from its fund balance for the next five years to cover the cost of the added recurring funds.
""We did this before, and even in the depth of the worst recession since the Great Depression, revenue in that five-year period increased sufficiently to offset our dependence,"" Royster said. ""We have an extremely sufficient fund balance, and if you think about it, we really haven't tapped it for two years.""
The revenue projections could change by the time the South Carolina General Assembly passes its budget, and Royster said administrators believe any revenue changes that could come between now and then will be positive.
""We're very confident we're going to get more money from the state,"" Royster said. ""We're never going to bring you something that is not extremely conservative related to differential between revenue and expense.""
Board members had the first reading of the budget on April 29. A public hearing on the budget is scheduled for May 18 at 6 p.m., with a final reading on the same day at 6:30 p.m.

123,"Oxfam International issued the following news release:Wheat flour reserves in the Occupied Palestinian Territory could be exhausted within three weeks and the cost of this food staple has surged by nearly 25% because of the Ukraine crisis, warns Oxfam.""Palestinian households are being hit hard by rising global food prices, and many are struggling to meet their basic needs. The reliance on imports and the constraints forced upon them by Israel's continuing military occupation, settler violence and land grabs are compounding the food crisis,"" says Shane Stevenson, Oxfam Country Director in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and Israel.The Palestinian Authority (PA) has to import 95% of its wheat but it owns no food storage infrastructure so is forced to rely instead on the Palestinian private sector and Israel's facilities. Israel in turn imports half of its grain and cereals from Ukraine.According to the World Food Program, the Ukraine crisis has increased food prices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory such as wheat flour (up by 23.6%), corn oil (26.3%) lentils (17.6%) and table salt (30%), decimating Palestinians' purchasing power.Most households in the Gaza Strip are now buying food on credit. Many families are eating less and lower quality of food items. Families are cutting out more expensive food such as fruit, meat and chicken that are necessary for a healthy diet.The cost of animal feed (wheat bran) is up by 60% in the West Bank. This adds to the existing burden on Palestinian herders who face outbreaks of animal disease, worsening violent attacks by Israeli settlers and forced displacement because of Israeli annexation policies.To save the livestock sector from collapsing, the Palestinian Farmers Union is urging the government to cancel the VAT on fodder.Abbas Melhem of the Palestinian Farmers' Union said: ""The sector is on its last breath and needs to be supported before it completely crashes. We have called upon the Palestinian Prime Minister to take immediate action. Farmers in Area C are facing daily attacks by Israeli settlers to push them off their land. With these challenges, especially with the extremely high prices of fodder, livestock breeders cannot stay and defend their lands if no immediate action is taken from our government to help save the livestock sector."".Area C - consisting of 60% West Bank territory - is critical to the geographic integrity of the West Bank. Its fertile agricultural lands offer the solution to Palestine increasing its agricultural investments and reducing its dependency on imports. However, Israeli authorities have rejected 99% of all the construction plans put forward to develop Area C.Mazen Sinokrot, the Regional Director of the Arab Food Industries Federation, said: ""Palestine cannot expect to rely on the Israeli food reserves in times of crises. Palestine could attempt to strategically bring to the forefront the political issue of Area C once more into the international arena so that Palestinians may use their land for planting wheat and building their self-sufficiency"".Oxfam calls on the international community to urgently adopt a common and coordinated economic and diplomatic position that challenges Israel's restrictive policies and allows Palestinians to invest in local food production and infrastructure. Oxfam believes that the international community must not forget its responsibility towards the Palestinian people, impacted by the policies and practices of an expansionist state operating with full impunity.The Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute, MAS, told Oxfam: ""Effective policies must be taken by the government in order to find urgent alternatives to wheat and flour imported from Russia and Ukraine. This is critical in order to protect poor and marginalized families from rising food insecurity and fluctuations in the supply chain due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The government must monitor and control prices in local markets and prevent monopoly on basic commodities .""Even before the Ukraine crisis, more than 115,000 families were registered with the Palestinian National Cash Transfer Programme (PNCTP) and received a quarterly payment between 700-1800 NIS (200-500 EUR) from the PA. 14,000 more poor households are on the PNCTP waiting list, which is expected to rise. However, registered families have not received payments since May 2021 because the PA is in a financial crisis. This is exacerbated by the decision of the European Commission - as the largest donor to Palestine and contributing to roughly 50% of the PNCTP - to continue withholding 214 million Euros in aid to the PA.Najla Shawa, Oxfam's Head of Food Security in Gaza, said: ""Every day we meet people who are searching for jobs and money just to feed their children. We feel very stuck at this stage. How can we draw attention from the international community to the deteriorating socio-economic situation in Gaza? Our work in Gaza is becoming increasingly challenging. It is difficult to describe the true level of damage that all this is causing on people's lives - it is devastating.""* * *Notes to editors* The Ministry of National Economy estimates that its wheat flour reserves will last around 2-3 months, but economic experts dispute this, saying stocks could be exhausted in 2-3 weeks. In order to cope with rising food prices the Ministry of National Economy added VAT exemptions of 16% on wheat flour (25kg and above) for 3 months (March-May), as well as a VAT exemption of 16% for bakeries for 3 months.* In 2022, 2.1 million Palestinians across the oPt will require some form of humanitarian assistance, of whom 64 per cent, or 1.3 million people, live in Gaza.

125,"As the city plans to revamp the Madison bus system with a new 
transit network redesign and bus rapid transit, a new Wisconsin 
Policy Forum report shows that the COVID-19 pandemic significantly 
decreased both traffic on Madison roads and use of the city's bus 
system altogether.
But despite traffic largely returning to its pre-pandemic levels, 
ridership on Wisconsin's major transit systems - including Madison 
- remain far below what they used to be, ""reinforcing the 
conclusion that the pandemic's impact on transportation in 
Wisconsin could have long-term implications,"" the WPF report says.
The likely cause is a reduction in the number of people commuting 
to work.
""Though weekday traffic may still further recover, the potential 
for a long-term shift should be considered when it comes to future 
road construction and transit route decisions,"" the report says.
As of April 2022, weekend traffic volumes have shown stronger 
recoveries than weekday volumes since March 2021, according to 
Wisconsin Department of Transportation data. And over the last 
year, from April 2021 to March 2022, weekend traffic exceeded 
pre-pandemic levels in six out of 12 months.
Meanwhile, there has not yet been a single month in which weekday 
traffic topped pre-pandemic levels, WPF writes.
In Dane County in March 2022, weekday traffic was down 9.8% and 
6.1% on weekends compared to March 2019, data show.
""DOT and WPF analyses indicate that while overall traffic volumes 
are beginning to look similar to those in the mid-2010s, the new 
reality is weekend travel that has largely returned to normal and 
weekday rush hours that are less intense than they used to be,"" the 
report says.
While traffic has yet to fully recover since the onset of the 
pandemic, ridership on Wisconsin's major transit systems shows an 
even more drastic picture.
Madison's big drop
Madison is home to one of nine bus systems in the state that has 
complete ridership data from every month since January 2007. WPF 
writes that ridership levels remain ""alarmingly low"" for all nine 
bus systems and there has yet to be a single month where even one 
bus system reached the same number of rides as the corresponding 
month prior to the pandemic.
And Madison has seen a much bigger drop in riders than other 
systems. Since April 2020, bus ridership has been down 65% or more. 
One potential explanation, according to WPF, is a higher 
concentration of white-collar jobs in the city with the ability to 
work from home.
Federal pandemic relief funds are helping Madison and other metro 
systems weather the sharp decline in passenger revenue.
Just Tuesday, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Pete 
Buttigieg announced Wisconsin will receive more than $115 million 
in federal funding for transit projects this fiscal year, with 
$12.5 million on its way to Madison.
Madison Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway said she is ""grateful for the 
ongoing support for transit and transportation in Madison from 
Secretary Buttigeig and President Biden,"" and that the city has 
built a strong partnership with the federal government to help move 
Madison forward.
The city requested $80 million in federal funds for the 
long-discussed bus rapid transit system, half of the $160 million 
projected cost. The project will run from the east side of the city 
to the west and aims to provide faster, higher-capacity and 
limited-stop service using 60-foot-long buses on city streets and 
dedicated lanes.
The rest of the money will come from a combination of federal 
grants already received and local dollars, according to the city.
Justin Stuehrenberg, the city's metro transit general manager, told 
the Cap Times there are a few sources where Metro gets funds 
directly from the Federal Transit Administration on a regular basis 
- also called ""formula funds.""
The funding is based on population, transit service quantity and 
distributed to agencies nationwide, used for expenditures and 
maintenance. They cannot be used for operations, though. Madison 
received roughly $9.6 million in 2021 and $12.5 million in 2022 in 
formula funds, a $2.9 million increase primarily due to the 
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.
""We plan to continue using these funds on our capital projects, 
including facility renovations and bus replacement over the coming 
years,"" Stuehrenberg said. ""We will allocate specific amounts to 
specific projects through the budget process later this year. 
Unlike with competitive grants, we don't have to have a specific 
project in mind to apply for before receiving the money - the funds 
are allocated to us and then we make the project allocations.""
However, WPF writes that once federal funds are exhausted, cities 
may be faced with a choice of cutting or altering services, or 
making up the difference with other revenue.
The report goes on to suggest state and local policymakers consider 
the declines in both traffic and transit ridership as they make 
decisions on transit routes, roadway improvements and parking, 
bicycle and pedestrian amenities.
Because Wisconsinites are still not driving cars and riding buses 
to the same extent they did in 2019 and early 2020, leaders may 
also need to rethink roads and transit services to reflect the way 
people travel in a post-pandemic world.
""Between various rounds of federal COVID relief funds and the 
federal infrastructure legislation, Wisconsin has and will receive 
massive influxes of monies for both transit and highways,"" the 
report says. ""Those funds will help to make up for losses in state 
and local revenues in the short term but would ideally be used also 
to help address the long-term implications of changing commuting 
habits.""

One day after a 13-4 win over the  Braves, Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks served up four home runs in a six-run first inning on the way to a 13-4 loss before 10,343 on a comfortable, 60-degree night at Wrigley Field. (According to Stats Perform, its only the second time in baseball history that back-to-back games in a series ended with a 13-4 score.)
The Braves took two out of three in the series, leaving the 6-9 Cubs in last place in the National League Central.
Manager David Ross said before the game its not a distraction for the players to be in the Sunday night game, especially in the COVID-19 era when  media  are not allowed in the clubhouse.
Its a typical game, and every game is on TV, Ross said. I dont know how it is a distraction.

Theres not extra media around because of COVID. Maybe it used to be more of a big deal. Its kind of a bonus  -  you get to sleep in on Sunday and have a night game on the weekend.
The Cubs probably shouldve stayed in bed all day.
Hendricks (0-2), who was scratched from his start in Milwaukee last Tuesday  when he wasnt feeling well, gave up seven runs on seven hits and three walks in  four innings.
Freddie Freeman, Travis dArnaud, Ehire Adrianza and Guillermo Heredia  homered off Hendricks in the first,  and any thoughts of the Cubs building momentum from Saturdays win were immediately dashed.
The last time the Cubs served up four home runs in an inning was July 4, 2010, against the Cincinnati Reds, when Ted Lilly gave up three and Jeff Stevens one in the seventh inning of a 14-3 Cubs loss at Wrigley Field.
That  game  took 2 hours, 40 minutes to complete, while Sunday nights game clocked in at 3:26.
After entering the game with a 3.00 ERA and one home run allowed, Hendricks left with a 6.92 ERA and five homers allowed in  13 innings.
Ross called it extremely surprising to see Hendricks put the Cubs in such a big hole.
When he takes the mound, you feel like youre going to be able to settle in and kind of let the game come to you, Ross said. It just wasnt his night tonight. Couldnt find it. We trust Kyle and have a lot of confidence in Kyle when he takes the mound.
Hendricks has endured two terrible starts that sandwiched a strong outing against the Milwaukee Brewers on April 7 in which he threw six shutout innings. Ross said it may have been a case of rust after the layoff, which Hendricks attributed to a cold that the Cubs were ultra-cautious about because of COVID-19 concerns.
You wouldnt want that to permeate to the rest of the group obviously and have something really bad happen, he said.
Hendricks wouldnt use the layoff as an excuse. He said he was unaggressive, adding all of his pitches were flat in the first inning.
But misery loves company, and Cubs reliever Ryan Tepera  -  who is available after appealing his three-game suspension for throwing at Brewers pitcher Brandon Woodruff  -  was almost as awful as Hendricks in only one inning.
The Cubs still harbored thoughts of a late comeback, trailing 7-3. In a brutal seven-batter stretch, Alec Mills gave up a double, an RBI single,  and another double before Tepera hit a batter, allowed a sacrifice fly, hit another batter and served up a grand slam to Heredia to make it 13-3.
Anthony Rizzo hit a pair of solo home runs for the Cubs, doubling his RBI total to  four, but once again the Cubs failed to do much damage when they werent hitting the long ball. Twelve of their 13 runs  Saturday came on six home runs.
Their average has jumped from .166 through Friday  to .192 by the end of play Sunday, inching them close to the Mendoza line. Rizzo said he sees signs of life from the offense.
In the beginning of the year, you always want to get off to the (Yermín) Mercedes 8-for-8 start and be able to relax and get those hits and get all those firsts out of the way, Rizzo said. This is still early. Its still not even three weeks in.
Its just human nature. You want to get off to a good start. The jitters are back. Fans are back. Its just getting used to the whole atmosphere again. I think the last two days showed good life for our offense approach-wise and the way were hitting the ball. Its a good sign for things to come.
The Cubs failed to build  momentum after Saturdays big win, their first laugher of the year.
Yeah, we wanted to build off that obviously and win the series, regardless, Hendricks said. Definitely disa

132,"ONEIDA - After a two-year hiatus because of the pandemic, the Oneida Nation Pow Wow is scheduled to return this summer.
""Everybody's missing the pow wow,"" said Tonya Webster, chairwoman of the Oneida Nation Pow Wow Advisory Council. ""Our last one was in July of 2019.""
The pow wow that had been scheduled for 2020 would have been the 48th annual. This year's pow wow is scheduled for July 1-3.
""It's more or less a gathering for all nations to come together,"" Webster said. ""Dancers will be showcasing their styles of dance.""
The three-day dance contest will still be done with COVID-19 safety protocols.
""Our theme is community healing, and we hope this event will bring people together, while standing 6 feet apart,"" Webster told the Oneida Nation's newsletter, Kalihwisaks. ""We hope everyone will mark their calendar and come home.""
She said it may be a hotter-than-typical pow wow because organizers are not setting up any tents to keep the entire festival in the open air and reduce or eliminate the spread of COVID-19.
During the grand entry, the dancers will not circle and congregate in the arena, but will come in dancing from one side and exiting the other to encourage social distancing.
The pow wow grounds at the Norbert Hill Center, N7210 Seminary Road, Oneida, have been reconfigured to add more bleachers to the arena to help spectators spread out.
Webster said organizers are still hoping for the same number of people who typically come to the pow wow over the three days, which is about 10,000.
The event is also an opportunity for Indigenous art vendors to showcase and sell their craftwork.
The number of food and vendor booths is being reduced from 41 to 25 to encourage social distancing.
Hand sanitizing stations will be placed throughout the grounds.
Last year's pow wow had first been postponed and then canceled about three weeks before the scheduled date because of a rapid spread of COVID-19 variants.
Webster is optimistic the pow wow will go ahead this year because the pandemic finally appears to be waning.
Earlier this month, the Oneida public health officers ended the face covering requirement for enclosed spaces on the reservation, which had been in place since the start of the pandemic.
The requirement was lifted because Brown and Outagamie counties are now identified as ""low"" infection risk areas under Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance.
Tribal health officials are still urging people to keep their masks with them because some businesses may still require face coverings.
Indigenous nations in Wisconsin have had some of the most stringent pandemic safety protocols in the state during the pandemic. Some mandates, such as face coverings, have been difficult to enforce at sites, including Festival Foods and Walmart on reservation land on west side of Green Bay.
Tribal health officials said they implemented stringent health protocols because of Indigenous people's experiences of mass death during previous pandemics and because Indigenous people were at higher risk because of a lack of good health care for people of color.
Last winter, Indigenous people in Wisconsin suffered the highest rate of death from COVID-19 among all ethnic groups in the state.

134,"The COVID-19 pandemic continued to dominate headlines in 2021, but there are many stories beyond the pandemic that had an impact on our region. Here is a look at those stories as we close out the year:
1. Local woman arrested after Capitol riot
In the aftermath of the January breach of the U.S. Capitol, a Swoyersville woman was arrested and charged with cheering on rioters and sending videos of destruction and chaos from inside the besieged building.
Annie C. Howell, 31, was charged with obstructing an official proceeding of Congress, disorderly conduct on restricted property, violent entry into a Capitol building, trespassing and picketing in a Capitol building.
Federal prosecutors alleged Howell was among the mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, forcing Congress to adjourn from its task of counting the electoral votes that cinched President-elect Joe Biden’s victory.
Recording video from inside a trashed conference room, Howell could be heard chanting, “Whose house? Our House!” and “Fight for Trump!”
Prosecutors also released several social media posts Howell made implicating herself in the breach, at one point bragging that she was “inside the (Capitol).”
“A police officer shot an unarmed woman today, who was a Trump supporter and KILLED HER,” Howell wrote on Facebook. “I have countless photos of bloody patriots, including myself. They shot us, hit us with sticks, tear gassed us, shot us with rubber bullets and knocked us to our feet! We couldn’t breathe or see for over 10 minutes. They fired shots, grenades and tear gas and mase (sic) back to back to back, relentlessly. Women and children! Who were sitting there!!!! IMAGINE IF THEY DID THIS TO (Black lives matter). ANTIFA LEADER IS THE ONE WHO BROKE INTO THE CAPITAL (sic)!”
On Dec. 2, Howell pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of trespassing on restricted property in exchange for prosecutors dropping the more serious felony charges against her.
Howell is scheduled to be sentenced March 2.

2. Wilkes-Barre Area opens new high school
The Wilkes-Barre Area School District closed two high schools and opened a consolidated high school in Plains Twp. for all district students in 2021.
GAR Jr./Sr. High School also became GAR Middle School when the new school year began in September. In June, the three high schools held the final graduation ceremonies.
The school district has pending agreements to sell the Coughlin and Meyers properties. Meyers’ developer wants to convert Meyers in South Wilkes-Barre into an assisted living facility.
Coughlin’s developer intends to convert the old stone portion of the school to apartments, and a private Jewish school is currently operating inside the newer Coughlin annex in downtown Wilkes-Barre.
On Aug. 26, the district held a ribbon-cutting event for the new Wilkes-Barre Area High School, and the first day of school was Sept. 9. Around 2,100 students are enrolled in grades 9-12 at the new high school.
The high school project began in April 2019 with a $121 million budget, and officials expect it will be under budget by more than $2 million. On Oct. 18, the school board approved an agreement to spend nearly $8.5 million building a new athletic field with lights and a grandstand by the new high school.
Wilkes-Barre Area played football in 2021 at Wyoming Valley West’s Spartan Stadium in Kingston. Wilkes-Barre Memorial Stadium was not available in 2021 because of the pending sale of Meyers.

3. Scranton native Joe Biden becomes 46th president
Scranton native Joe Biden was sworn in as 46th President of the United States in January.
Part of his campaign’s strategy to win the White House was to perform better in the 2020 election in places like Luzerne County against Republican President Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton did in 2016.
While Biden couldn’t flip Luzerne County back into the Democratic column, the former vice president did better than the former secretary of state in Luzerne County.
Kathy Bozinski, the county Democratic Party chairwoman watched Biden’s inauguration at campaign headquarters with fellow volunteers.
“That inaugural ceremony was so powerful and so uplifting. President Biden went out of his way to talk to everyone in this country,” Bozinski said. “What a breakthrough. We have prayed, hoped, dreamed and fought for a moment like this today.”
During his campaign for president, Biden visited the Fox Hill Country Club Exeter for a private fundraiser attended by about 200 people. He praised his roots in Northeast Pennsylvania.
“The Scranton/Wilkes-Bare area, Lackawanna and Luzerne counties, is where I learned everything there is to learn about the basic values of this country,” Biden said during a 35-minute speech.
In the weeks leading up to the 2020 election, Biden held a drive-in rally that was headlined by a performance by Jon Bon Jovi.

4. Former C&Y director charged with child endangerment
Joanne Van Saun, director of Luzerne County Children & Youth Services, was charged with misdemeanor counts of child endangerment and obstruction of justice on July 6.
The state attorney general’s office alleged that Van Saun directed Children & Youth employees to falsely terminate reports of child abuse and neglect, to clear a crushing backlog of reports.
Van Saun, 59, pleaded guilty in Dauphin County Court in October. On Dec. 15, she was sentenced to 34 months of probation, with the first nine months on house arrest.
Van Saun worked for Children & Youth for more than 30 years. She was appointed director of the agency in March 2016.
It is not clear if Van Saun will receive a $4,467 per month county pension.
On the day Van Saun was charged, county officials said she had retired on July 1. However, a subsequent personnel report stated that she had been terminated.
The county retirement board has yet to vote on Van Saun’s pension.
Acting county Manager Romilda Crocamo hired the law firm Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders to conduct a review of the county Children & Youth Services agency. That review should be completed in January, according to Crocamo.
In August, Crocamo placed three management-level Children & Youth employees on unpaid administrative leave based on the findings of Troutman Pepper’s ongoing review
The names of those three managers were not released.
The criminal complaint against Van Saun alleges that she selected three senior-level agency employees to lead the team that was told to “eradicate” the backlog of reports.
In a news release announcing that Van Saun had been charged, Attorney General Josh Shapiro said three Children & Youth employees, while not charged with crimes, agreed to not serve in any position where they would be a mandated reporter of potential abuse until at least 2025.
It is not clear if the managers Crocamo placed on leave are the same people referenced in either the criminal complaint or the news release.
Crocamo said she will not appoint a new Children & Youth director until the Troutman Pepper review is completed.

5. County election woes continue
Ongoing problems surrounding Luzerne County elections continued in 2021.
In a move that shocked county political observers, the county board of elections voted on Feb. 24 to appoint county Councilman Stephen J. Urban as board chairman, even though the county charter prohibits anyone holding elective office from serving on the election board.
Council declared vacant the election board seats held by Urban and the two board members who voted to appoint him chairman: Joyce Dombroski-Gebhardt and Keith Gould.
Council appointed new board members to fill the vacant seats. The only member of the five-person board who was in office at both the start and finish of 2021 is Audrey Serniak.
In the May 18 primary, a glitch in the county’s electronic voting system caused Democratic headers to appear on Republican ballots.
County officials blamed Dominion Voting Systems, which supplied the voting machines the county unveiled last year.
In August, Crocamo hired The Elections Group, a Colorado-based consulting firm, to help the county run a smooth election in November.
However, the Nov. 2 election featured ballot-related issues in several municipalities, with candidate names listed for incorrect offices or incorrect instructions regarding how many candidates voters should select.
Bob Morgan announced his resignation as county election director in late September. His last day on the job was Oct. 8, just 25 days prior to the election.
In December, Crocamo appointed Michael Susek as election director. Susek is a Plains Twp. native with 15 years of experience as an elections administrator in Colorado.

6. Republicans dominate general election
A red wave swept Luzerne County in the Nov. 2 municipal election.
Republicans won all five contested seats on county council, as well as the county controller’s race. Also, Republicans won both contested seats on the county court of common pleas, while Republican Sam Sanguedolce ran unopposed for district attorney.
The winning council candidates were incumbent Chris Perry and newcomers Brian Thornton, Kevin Lescavage, John Lombardo and Gregory Wolovich Jr., who won election on his third try.
County Councilman Walter Griffith defeated incumbent Democrat Michelle Bednar in a rematch of the 2017 race for controller. Griffith will resign his council seat before taking office as controller on Jan. 3. Griffith previously served as controller from 2010-2013, but resigned as part of a plea agreement in a wiretapping case.
Stefanie Salavantis and Tarah Toohil will be the newest county court judges. Salavantis resigned as district attorney in March to run for judge. Toohil resigned her seat in the state House of Representatives.
Republicans will hold a 10-1 majority on council in 2022.

7. Deadly snow shoveling dispute
On a cold winter morning early in the year, a simmering dispute between neighbors boiled over with deadly results.
It began shortly before 9 a.m. Feb. 1, when Plains Twp. resident Jeffrey Spaide, 47, was shoveling snow from his driveway at 6 W. Bergh St., and his neighbors, James Goy, 50, and Lisa Goy, 48, were clearing off their cars.
Authorities said the neighbors had been involved in prior disputes, and that things spiraled out of control when the Goys began pushing snow across the street and throwing it onto Spaide’s property.
Spaide asked them to stop, leading to a heated exchange during which James Goy threw a tool he was using to clear snow from his car and approached his neighbor in the street.
James Goy raised a fist and Spaide went to his house as the Goys yelled and cursed at him, according to prosecutors.
Spaide came back out with a pistol and opened fire as the Goys continued shouting names at him from the middle of the street.
When the Goys dropped to the ground, Spaide went back into his house and retrieved an AR-15-style rifle, which he used to shoot the injured Goys again, killing them, prosecutors said.
Spaide then went back inside his house and shot himself as police arrived on the scene, according to prosecutors.
The case was officially ruled a double murder-suicide.

8. ‘My dude in Forty Fort’
Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, a Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate, repeatedly brought up a voter fraud case out of Forty Fort this year.
He called the suspect, Robert Richard Lynn, 68, “my dude from Forty Fort” and even sold T-shirts with that phrase to raise money for his campaign.
Lynn pleaded guilty to a voter fraud charge in August and was sentenced to probation.
He was was accused of committing election fraud in his dead mother’s name in an effort to earn former President Donald Trump an extra vote
Reached by The Citizens’ Voice earlier this year, Fetterman said the “dude in Forty Fort” line had “taken on a life of its own” so he ran with it.
Fetterman said he was trying to draw attention to how rare voter fraud is by pointing out that the case from tiny Forty Fort is one of only three known statewide unlike the massive voter fraud claimed by Trump.

9. Salavantis resigns to pursue seat on county bench
Stefanie Salavantis announced in February that she would resign as district attorney to run for county judge. Salavantis was in the second year of her third four-year term as district attorney.
That announcement set off a series of controversies over when she would resign and how the next district attorney would be appointed. Looming in the background was legislation regarding district attorney succession that was working its way through the state legislature.
After Salavantis filed a nominating petition to run for judge, county council declared the district attorney seat vacant on March 9. Council members cited a provision of the county charter that requires the district attorney to resign upon filing a petition to run for another office.
Salavantis said council’s action was “contrary to state law” and retained legal counsel.
The matter was resolved two weeks later, after council and Salavantis reached agreement that she would resign March 25, the day she was certified as a candidate for judge.
The same day, Sam Sanguedolce was sworn in as the county’s new district attorney. He had been first assistant to Salavantis. Both are Republicans.
Legislation signed into law by Gov. Tom Wolf on March 23 stipulates that a first assistant district attorney fills a vacancy in the district attorney’s position.
However, legal opinions differ as to whether the legislation stipulates that a special election should be held if a district attorney resigns in the first half of a four-year term, as Salavantis did.
The county election board voted in April to place the district attorney seat on the Nov. 2 ballot, then later voted the seat would be for two years, to fill out the remainder of Salavantis’s term, rather than for a full four-year term.
County council hired the law firm Stevens & Lee to seek a legal opinion on whether the district attorney seat should appear on the November ballot.
In August, council and Sanguedolce sued the election board, alleging the board’s decision to place the district attorney seat on the ballot violated state law.
Chester County Senior Judge Robert J. Shenkin denied a requested preliminary injunction to remove the race from the Nov. 2 ballot. The state Commonwealth Court upheld Shenkin’s decision.
Sanguedolce ran unopposed and won election to a two-year term.
Council withdrew from further legal action over the matter in December.
Sanguedolce said last week he has not decided what his next step will be, if any, in the case.

10. Pedri resigns as county manager
David Pedri announced on May 21 that he would resign as Luzerne County manager to become president and CEO of the nonprofit Luzerne Foundation. His last day on the job was July 6.
Pedri, a Butler Twp. resident and former county chief solicitor, had served as head of the administrative branch of county government since 2016.
County council appointed chief solicitor Romilda Crocamo as acting manager. A council-appointed citizen search committee will screen and interview qualified candidates to serve as the next full-time manager.
The search committee will recommend finalists to council, which will hire the next manager. The committee’s timeline calls for submitting names of at least three finalists in early April.
Crocamo has not said whether she will apply for the full-time manager position.

135,"Sep. 16 - Wisconsin residents not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 were 3.9 times more likely to test positive for the disease in August than those fully vaccinated, 8.6 times more likely to be hospitalized for it and 10.6 times more likely to die from it, the state Department of Health Services said Wednesday.
Meanwhile, the state reported 3,426 new COVID-19 cases, the highest daily total since Jan. 7, for a daily average of 1,864 cases, the highest since Jan. 18. The state reported 20 COVID-19 deaths, for a daily average of 15, the highest since February.
In August, there were 1,413.7 COVID-19 cases, 98.5 hospitalizations and 11.7 deaths per 100,000 people not fully vaccinated, the state health department said. Among those fully vaccinated, there were 360.7 cases, 11.5 hospitalizations and 1.1 deaths per 100,000.
It was the second time the state released such data. Last month, officials said that in July, unvaccinated people were nearly three times as likely to be infected with COVID-19, nearly four times as likely to be hospitalized for it and 11 times as likely to die from it as those fully vaccinated. The figures are age-adjusted because vaccination rates vary among age groups.
A Kaiser Family Foundation report Tuesday said the preventable costs of treating unvaccinated patients in hospitals nationwide was $5.7 billion in June, July and August.
Some ""breakthrough"" infections, in people fully vaccinated, are expected because no vaccine is 100% effective, health officials say. The more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, combined with inadequate vaccination rates, has in recent months caused a COVID-19 surge, officials say.
Statewide, 93.3% of intensive care beds were being used by patients with COVID-19 and other conditions as of Wednesday, with more than half of hospitals saying their ICUs were at peak capacity, the state health department said.
The Wisconsin Hospital Association said 1,054 patients were hospitalized with COVID-19, 321 of them in intensive care.
Among people 65 and older, hospitalizations for COVID-19 were 6.6 times higher in August among the unvaccinated than among the fully vaccinated, according to the state health department. The gap was higher for younger groups, including 11.1 times higher among ages 45 to 54, 14.7 times higher among ages 35 to 44 and 12.3 times higher among ages 25 to 34.
In Dane County, residents not fully vaccinated were 2.5 times more likely to be infected in August, Public Health Madison and Dane County recently said. In July, they were 2.1 times more likely to be infected and 2.3 times more likely to hospitalized for COVID-19, the department said.
Statewide, as of Wednesday, 55.9% of residents had received at least one dose of vaccine and 52.6% were fully vaccinated, the state health department said. Among adults, 66.9% have had at least one dose and 63.2% are fully vaccinated. Children younger than 12, who aren't yet eligible for immunization, make up about 14% of the population.

136,"When the Los Angeles Rams learned they had a chance to land Odell 
Beckham Jr., their veterans assembled in the locker room Thursday 
morning. Jalen Ramsey made a call, and the Rams took turns 
recruiting the veteran receiver to their West Coast home.
""Felt like college, huh?"" receiver Robert Woods said with a grin.
The Rams clearly sold themselves and their Super Bowl vision quite 
well to the mercurial receiver.
Beckham agreed to a one-year deal with Los Angeles, choosing this 
burgeoning super team over several potential free agent 
destinations.
The Browns released the disgruntled Beckham on Monday, midway 
through his third season in Cleveland. He cleared waivers Tuesday 
with no team willing to pick up the $7.25 million he was owed under 
his last contract, freeing the five-time 1,000-yard wideout to sign 
with any team.
After considering his options and getting the full-court press from 
his future teammates, Beckham elected to join NFL yards passing 
leader Matthew Stafford and coach Sean McVay in the league's most 
productive passing offense.
""I have a lot of respect for who he is as a player,"" said Stafford, 
who played with Beckham in a Pro Bowl. ""It's an opportunity for us 
as a team. It's an opportunity for him to come in here and prove 
himself to us. What our room is about, the receiver room, is pretty 
special. I know he'll fit right in and just continue to get better, 
and hopefully it will help us as a team.""

The deal is worth $10 million, including $4.5 million in fully 
guaranteed money and a $1.5 million roster bonus, according to a 
person familiar with the situation.

","BECKHAM, RAMS AGREE TO 1-YEAR DEAL"
137,"When Sidney Crosby and the Penguins hit town looking for their 10th straight win, you better have your A-game ready.
It's up for debate whether the Flyers had their A-game spirit on Thursday night, but they didn't have a lot of their A-game players due to COVID-19 and injuries.
The result was predictable: Penguins 6, Flyers 2. Pittsburgh now has won 10 consecutive games while the Flyers dropped their fourth straight (0-3-1) to put a little tarnish on their recent seven-game (5-0-2) point streak.
Due to COVID-19, the Flyers were without Claude Giroux, Ivan Provorov, Travis Konecny and Travis Sanheim, while Sean Couturier remains injured.
Subs like rookie defensemen Egor Zamula and Cam York, plus forward Connor Bunnaman (the Flyers even had fourth-liner Max Willman playing on the second line) just weren't enough to break the Penguins' streak. The Flyers' record fell to 13-15-6.
Flyers interim head coach Mike Yeo wasn't buying any excuses.
In fact, he sort of called out his team, saying it might have looked at the lineup card and didn't believe it could win this game.
Yeo also implied that better not be the Flyers' attitude toward the rest of this season, because the first sign of ""give up"" could spell disaster.
Besides, the Flyers haven't exactly been setting the world on fire when they do have a complete lineup. They have given up the first goal of the game 17 times in 34 games this season and won a grand total of two of those encounters.
""In all honesty, we were missing some guys,"" Yeo acknowledged. ""So how do you compensate for that? You up your compete level. You dig in harder to your team game. You have to show more resilience, heart. I thought we had an OK start and the next thing you know they score a goal and after that — whether we didn't believe we could win — we were not good enough.""
This form of criticism is about as harsh as it gets. Maybe it will be a wakeup call that things came a little too easy during that seven-game streak.
""We can talk about X's and O's and everything else,"" Yeo said. ""But it's just about how hard you fight. We can look at where we are in the season and we can just sort of accept our fate the rest of the way and say it's just not our year. Bad luck, this and that. You can do the same thing in a game or you can fight. You can determine your own fate, regardless of what the circumstances are. You can go down swinging but I don't think we did that tonight.""
It didn't take long for Pittsburgh to assert its will on the shorthanded Flyers in a three-goal first period. Of particular note, Penguins defenseman Kris Letang assisted on all three goals, two of them by Bryan Rust.
Goal number one came during a Pittsburgh power play. Letang spotted Rust open at the bottom of the left circle and goaltender Carter Hart had no chance to cover at the near post for the shot at 12:21.
Rust struck again at 14:55. With the teams skating four aside, Rust was open in the slot to convert a feed from Evan Rodrigues.
Finally, the Penguins capped the outburst at 16:16. Hart managed to get his glove on Jake Guentzel's short shot but the goalie's momentum carried the puck across the goal line.
Although the Flyers played better in the second period, the damage was done.
Cam Atkinson did his best to explain the current level of frustration.
""I don't think we did a good job in front of Hart,"" Atkinson said. ""We kind of left him out to dry the entire night. We have to find a way to not only help him but help ourselves. Guys have to look in the mirror a little bit and find a way to dig deeper. Get a little more fight in our game.""
Added Scott Laughton: ""Nine or 10 guys out, six guys in protocol, it's a tough league to win that way. It's a tough league to chase (a game). We've been doing that quite a bit. It sucks right now.""
Atkinson finally broke through for the Flyers at 8:10 of the second period. Joel Farabee teed it up for his linemate and Atkinson blasted home a shot from just outside the hash marks past Tristan Jarry for his 14th goal of the season.
In the third period, Rodriques scored at 8:50 and Guentzel notched his second at 10:30, both on break-ins. To add insult, at 11:51 Brian Boyle scored shorthanded. That was countered by Oskar Lindblom's goal on the same power play with seven minutes to play.
""You want to come out with a good start,"" Farabee said. ""They're a hot team right now. When you have this many guys out, it's not easy. I think we have to come out with a little more jump. Not sit back.""
Lines shuffled
Yeo had to scramble to put new lines together.
Derick Brassard, playing his first game since Dec. 8, skated on a line with Morgan Frost and James van Riemsdyk. Laughton centered a top line with Farabee and Atkinson. Kevin Hayes centered Bunnaman and Willman and Patrick Brown played pivot for Lindblom and Zack MacEwen.
On defense, Zamula was paired with Rasmus Ristolainen; York skated with Justin Braun and veteran Keith Yandle worked with Kevin Connauton.
Short shots

Letang, a Flyer nemesis for the better part of a decade, now has nine goals, 44 points with a plus-30 in 58 career games vs. Philly. ...

Jeremy Boynton, 49, a self-employed investment adviser, is an independent candidate. Incumbent Gary Fasules and newcomers Anne M. Gould and Kelley M. Kalinich are members of the Civic Betterment Party.
The Daily Herald asked the candidates several questions about issues facing the village.
Below are Boynton’s responses.

Bio Town: Glen Ellyn Age: 49 Occupation: Self-employed investment adviser Civic involvement: Founder and organizer of the men’s community group Glen Ellyn Boathouse Party Q&A Q: How do you view your role in confronting the pandemic: provide leadership even if unpopular, give a voice to constituents — even ones with whom you disagree, or defer to state and federal authorities?
A: Glen Ellyn needs independent leadership. The same small group of people, the Civic Betterment organization, have been running local Glen Ellyn politics for decades. I am running as an independent. And am not beholden to their political agenda.
Re the pandemic, we need to do two things: 1.) Implement best practices in our community to mitigate the spread of the disease. We need to be willing to adapt as new information/data becomes available. 2.) Implement policies to help local businesses survive. Such as utilizing more outdoor tent structures for restaurants, even through winter. It is about our health AND the economy. They are both important!
Q: Did your town continue to adequately serve its constituents during the disruptions caused by the pandemic? If so, please cite an example of how it successfully adjusted to providing services. If not, please cite a specific example of what could have been done better.
A: Glen Ellyn started well in responding to the pandemic. And they initially successfully adapted along the way as things changed. My only criticism might be that outdoor tent seating came down too early in the fall. Local restaurants are barely surviving. Those should have stayed up longer. Many towns in the Chicago suburbs are still utilizing them even today.
Q: In light of our experiences with COVID-19, what safeguards/guidelines should you put in place to address any future public health crises?
A: I believe it would be a mistake to implement broad policy mandates for future public health crises based on COVID-19. There will always be ""unknown unknowns"" in future crises. And government bureaucracy is notorious for contributing to the next crisis by overreacting to the last one.
Citizens in our community should be able to trust thoughtful leadership from their trustees to respond in real time to the demands of whatever crisis confronts us. My passion is to do exactly that — provide thoughtful, independent leadership as a village trustee.
Q: What cuts can local government make to reduce the burden of the pandemic on taxpayers?
A: I don’t believe the burden of the pandemic can be reduced by spending cuts. Rather, I believe some thoughtful increased expenditures could be efficiently made to help reduce the burden.
An example would be the addition of outdoor tent capacity for local restaurants. However, there is definitely a time and place to consider spending cuts. As a village trustee candidate, my brand promises to Glen Ellyn are to be ""Socially Compassionate. And Fiscally Responsible."" Sometimes fiscal responsibility means thoughtfully increasing expenditures. Other times it means thoughtfully reducing them.
It will take discernment from village leadership to know when to cut and when to spend . As an independent, nonpartisan trustee, I look forward to bringing openhanded and openhearted discernment and courage to this very important discussion.
Q: What do you see as the most important infrastructure project you must address? Why and how should it be paid for? Conversely, during these uncertain economic times, what infrastructure project can be put on the back burner?
A: Parking in downtown Glen Ellyn is definitely one of the most urgent infrastructure needs for our community. The vibrancy of our local downtown business district can be dramatically enhanced if we solve this problem. Of course, there is construction underway currently to alleviate this strain.
Regarding the second question, I do not believe it would serve the community of Glen Ellyn well to put any infrastructure project ""on the back burner."" Rather, we should be encouraging thoughtful development that also is respectful to the architectural heritage and ""vibe"" of our awesome community. Glen Ellyn needs to move forward. Not backward.
As an independent trustee, I look forward to championing this cause.
Q: Do you agree or disagree with the stance your board/council has taken on permitting recreational marijuana sales in the community? What would you change about that stance, if you could?
A: The import of most scientific research re recreational marijuana is quite conclusive: it is damaging to brain development and mental health in adolescents. However, it is also quite conclusive in finding that marijuana has significant positive health benefits for adults.
In fact, marijuana is likely more healthy than having a glass of bourbon (which I happen to like!). All of this might be used as an argument in favor of the current stance of Glen Ellyn leadership to NOT allow marijuana sales inside our community.
However, paradoxically, this disallowance creates a well known, easily accessible ""black market."" In truth, marijuana is ubiquitously available among our teenage population. One could make the case that our non-allowance has created this ""black market.""
Taking this further, legalizing the sale of marijuana inside our community might destroy that black market. Thus, potentially reducing the consumption of marijuana by our teenage population.
This is a complicated discussion. I have no firmly entrenched position. And I am open minded about seeking out thoughtful solutions.
Q: What’s one good idea you have to better the community that no one is talking about yet?
A: Five years ago, I founded and organized a monthly event called ""Glen Ellyn Boathouse Party."" We meet on the second Thursday of every month at the Glen Ellyn Boathouse. No political or religious agenda. Just guys (over 21 years of age) getting together to eat steak, talk about life, and enjoy a favorite beer/wine/bourbon. As men, we thrive on community. But we mostly suck at making that happen! We created this event as an attempt to change that. Over the past 5 years, we have developed friendships and a real sense of community. COVID made it necessary to suspend this gathering temporarily. I am looking forward to restarting it as soon as it is safe to do so. We all need community. Now more than ever.",Jeremy Boynton

[Financial Analysis and Commentary]
Drug development is among the most lucrative segments of U.S. industry, and perhaps the single most risky. With Royalty Pharma, investors looking for a middle ground can find their Prince Charming.
The upside of a given biotech investment is readily apparent. Covid-19 vaccine developers like Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech expect to book more than $50 billion in combined revenue this year at fat profit margins, resulting in huge gains for some investors.
Yet the sector is often too volatile and dangerous for the average individual investor. The reality is that drug development is expensive and difficult. The majority of drug candidates fail to reach the market, and spending hundreds of millions of dollars developing a product that generates zero sales is hardly uncommon.
Enter Royalty Pharma. The company, which was founded in 1996 and went public in June last year, helps fund expensive clinical trials for a promising new drug in a typical transaction. In exchange, the drugmaker sends Royalty a predetermined slice of that drug's revenue in the years after it reaches the market. The company owns rights to drugs sold by the likes of Johnson & Johnson, AbbVie, Pfizer, Gilead Sciences and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.
This hands-off model has several advantages. While all but the biggest drugmakers typically narrow their focus by therapeutic category, Royalty is able to generate revenue from oncology, rare diseases, HIV and diabetes. And while a traditional biotech often needs to raise equity capital on the public markets to fund its projects, Royalty is able to fund its new growth investments with debt and with cash coming in the door: In 2020, it deployed $2.4 billion into new deals and took in $1.8 billion in cash receipts. Being able to borrow at rock-bottom interest rates, unlike your standard biotech startup, certainly doesn't hurt.
That isn't to say Royalty shares are immune from the challenges of the drug industry. The stock has rallied about 40% since the IPO, but has sold off 16% over the past six months. For starters, any changes to tax policy or drug-pricing regulations could ding Royalty shares. One concern on Wall Street is that some cash flow from Vertex's cystic fibrosis franchise, which accounted for more than a quarter of all royalties received in the second quarter, might be at risk. A newVertex regimen to treat CF is about to begin a late-stage clinical trial; Vertex owes Royalty a smaller fraction of sales on the new treatment than it does on existing products.
Those worries are likely overblown. Royalty might not lose any ground if, for example, the new regimen reaches a greater number of patients or commands a higher price. Any change will likely be gradual. Rare-disease patients aren't always in a hurry to switch to new therapies.
New investors can take advantage of the pessimism. The stock trades at about 15 times last year's cash flow. So far this year, cash flow is up 25% from the first half of 2020.
Meanwhile, Royalty's record in identifying drugs with the potential to reach the market is stellar. From 2012 to 2020, 90% of cash deployed in development-stage deals went to drugs that received FDA approval. And going forward, that track record should pay even better: Royalty shares about one-sixth of its pre-IPO investments with legacy investors. They won't receive a stake in new investments going forward.
Expectations of strong performance in the years ahead are no fairy tale.

142,"Red All Over is a weekly newsletter covering Utah athletics. Subscribe here.
There appeared to be quite a bit of agita within the Utah football fan base Tuesday afternoon when news broke that redshirt junior wide receiver Bryan Thompson had entered his name into the NCAA Transfer Portal.
I get that. Older guy, a big downfield target, a starter in 2020, clearly part of the plan for Andy Ludwig’s offense. Thompson is not an insignificant loss.
About four hours later, Jaylen Dixon (remember him?) cryptically indicated on Twitter that he is returning to Utah in 2021. Dixon entered the transfer portal in October, with Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham saying at the time that “perhaps new surroundings and a fresh start would do him some good and I’m all for that, we’re all for that.”
My opinion on Wednesday’s roster shift: It’s a net positive. You’d rather not see a talented player like Thompson transfer, but Utah is losing 33 catches, 756 yards and four touchdowns in 33 career games, while regaining 56 catches for 932 and three touchdowns in 28 career games from Dixon.
At 5-foot-9, Dixon does not have the size of Thompson, but he has shown the ability to blow the lid off a defense, while clearly producing during the 2018 and 2019 seasons.
Not playing football in 2020 is something to consider in terms of fitness and readiness, but that can be worked out with practice and reps. Furthermore, whatever behind-the-scenes issues there were appear to have been resolved.
“He was going through some off-the field things,” Whittingham said Wednesday morning on SiriusXM Pac-12 Radio. “It wasn’t related to playing time, production, or any of that stuff, and that’s why he had the invitation to come back. It was special circumstances.
“We’re glad he’s on solid ground now, and his attitude is very good. He’s involved with the workouts and doing everything right at this point in time.”
Utah’s pass-catching options are numerous, both at receiver and tight end. Britain Covey, Solomon Enis and Brant Kuithe combined for 55 catches last season. A healthy Samson Nacua in 2021 would help, and so would Dixon, assuming health and him being fully engaged.
My opinion on Utah’s offense, on paper, minus Thompson: There are questions at quarterback and at running back, but the personnel is plenty good enough to contend for the Pac-12 South.
No, Thompson leaving the program is not a positive, but the totality of Wednesday’s happenings were.
What’s on my mind, Utah or otherwise
• Utah should count itself lucky that it only has two games to make up, because Arizona State has six. At this point, there is little to no chance that every team in the Pac-12 will end up playing 20 conference games. There simply isn’t enough time to get everything in.
• Collectively, the Pac-12 isn’t having a bad year. Stanford is squarely on the bubble, but the league has five teams looking good for NCAA Tournament berths. That number would be six had Arizona not self-imposed a one-year postseason ban. If I’m sticking to my long-held belief that sending half your teams to the Big Dance constitutes a good season for a conference, then the Pac-12 is having a good season.
• Per a league spokesman and multiple league sources, the expectation remains that the Pac-12 tournament is played, as scheduled, with all 11 eligible teams participating at T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas. Utah athletic director Mark Harlan said as much Wednesday during one of his twice-a-month appearances on ESPN700. I have something on this topic brewing for next week.
• The calendar is tight, but it might be a good idea for BYU to at least consider trying to squeeze in a high-level nonconference game at some point to improve its NCAA Tournament resume. The Cougars are not (yet) in danger of sliding on to the bubble, but another WCC loss to the wrong team might do it. Getting a top-75-ish nonconference win would only help the cause, while a loss to a team like that would not crush the resume. Just some food for thought as this weirdo COVID season starts to wind down.
• EA Sports is bringing back its NCAA Football franchise. It won’t be back in time for the 2021 season, but it’s coming. When it does, EA should do a series of regional covers, and it should put Ty Jordan on one in this part of the country.
Your questions
Q: “What league would you like to see the Pac-12 play in an in-season “challenge”? Let’s pretend the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12 and ACC aren’t available.” — @AJCrowley42
A: I’ll up the degree of difficulty here and pretend the Big East isn’t available either.
If you take the rest of the Power Six out of the equation, there is no obvious answer, because you’re left with a bunch of mid-major conferences, and really, why would the Pac-12 sign on for an in-season showcase against a league where losses would harm the resume?
In a vacuum, give me the Pac-12 vs. the West Coast Conference, but I doubt there would be enough interest to have every team from both conferences involved.
Take the Pac-12′s projected best team, or at least its most-attractive team, and pair it with Gonzaga. BYU gets a game, same with Santa Clara (Herb Sendek is a name the average fan knows), Pacific (Damon Stoudemire is a name everyone knows), and San Francisco (Todd Golden is a good, young up-and-coming head coach).
This is a good idea, but for a variety of reasons, it’s never going to happen.
Q: “Name three athletes that made you fall in love with sports?” — @Eric18Utah
A: This was harder than I thought it would be beyond No. 1, but here we go.
1. Patrick Ewing: I idolized the Knicks Hall of Fame center. Me, and a bajillion other New York kids of a certain age.
2. Michael Jordan: I’m a product of my era. Jordan was THE guy. In fact, he still is.
3. Curtis Martin: I was a teenager in 1997 by the time Martin came to the Jets, but his tenure made me fall totally, unapologetically, hopelessly in love with the team. They have yet to love me back, but I digress.
Q: “What is the status of Utah’s baseball stadium?” — @LimburgGarth
A: Keep waiting, you’re at least years away.
Utah announced early plans for a 2,000-seat on-campus baseball stadium nearly five years ago. The cost was pegged at $7.5 million, all of it funded by donors, with the baseball team beginning play there in 2018.
A shovel has not yet entered the ground on this project.
At this point, the primary objective in terms of athletics-related construction and renovation appears to be getting the $3 million together to renovate the Dumke Gymnastics Center.
Until then, the Utes will continue to play at Smith’s Ballpark, which is a great facility, but located several miles from campus.
Q: “What is a sport you don’t know much about, but wish you did?” — @highguyshyguy
A: Ice hockey.
Truth be told, I grew up a pretty big Rangers fan, and went to a lot of Islanders games as a kid, but I was never hardcore enough to really want to understand the game. I wish I had.
My father, a diehard Rangers fan, was effectively done rooting when the franchise finally won a Stanley Cup in 1994, and I pretty much followed suit. At that point, basketball had my full attention, and that was that.

• RIP to my favorite pizza place, Rose’s, which sits in the middle of the Long Island Railroad terminal at Penn Station. It wasn’t the best pizza around, but it was my favorite. You’re at Penn to catch a train and want a quick bite? Rose’s. You’re getting off the A-train and have to walk across the LIRR terminal to get to the 1, 2, or 3-train? Rose’s. You want an adult beverage for the train home? Rose’s, but make sure it’s in a brown bag, or the cops will want to have a word. She will be dearly missed.
• If I were Jeff Bezos, I would go as far off the grid as possible. New cell number, with no more than six people having access to it. Remember in Entourage, when Medillin bombed, and Vince fled to some island paradise with Turtle, and only Drama knew the number to reach him? Same idea, except it’s forever.

• The temperature in Salt Lake City cracked 40 degrees a few times this week, while parts of the northeast got two feet of snow. Advantage: Salt Lake City.
• The Dodo Restaurant in Sugar House: Solid, very solid. Good lunch option, I look forward to actually going in there for happy hour if we ever get back to normal.

146,"Mar. 8 - The major spending package approved by Oregon lawmakers at the end of the so-called short session will deliver a lot of money to Eastern Oregon, and while many projects of merit will receive cash the most significant outlay is money for the Union County Fairgrounds.
The fairgrounds are on track to receive $1 million, and it will be able to use every cent of that to help fund renovations projects, not the least of which will be the building of a new sewer line connection. The new connection will allow sewage to run from the facility to the city of La Grande's wastewater system. That, in turn, will mean the fairgrounds will once again have functioning restrooms, an amenity  -  really a necessity  -  that has been missing.
The sewer line project will cost about $2 million. The fairgrounds received around $270,000 in state funds earlier this year, and the additional $1 million from the new spending package will certainly go a long way to solving the sewer line challenge.
That should be great news to the residents of Union County. The fairground facility is more than just a place to hold a carnival once a year but an historic element to the county. Its worth cannot be evaluated in simple terms of expediency but must be seen through a holistic lens. The fairgrounds provide a place every year for the 4-H youth of the county to show off their hard work, and it also functions as an emergency site for such operations as COVID-19 vaccinations.
The $1 million outlay is the work of a host of lawmakers who deserve to be lauded. Those lawmakers ensured that money could be sent to fairgrounds across Eastern Oregon, including Malheur, Baker and Harney counties. The money is needed and will arrive not a moment too soon.
We often can take a facility like the Union County Fairgrounds for granted. We shouldn't. That's because such facilities are part of our hometown fabric and should never be forgotten or dismissed. Is more money needed for the fairgrounds? Certainly. Yet this latest infusion of funds will help get a facility we need back on track toward the futur

150,"RICHMOND — Wayne County recorded its daily and weekly COVID-19 case highs Jan. 3-9, with all seven days exceeding 100 reported cases.
The county reported 1,059 laboratory-confirmed cases during the Monday-Sunday period the state uses to calculate county metric scores, according to day-by-day Indiana State Department of Health case totals. The case total represents about 1.5% of the county's population.
That total is also 83.5% higher than the previous Monday-Sunday high of 577 from Aug. 23-29, according to the state's statistics, and 84.8% higher than the previous week's 573 cases.
During the week, the county recorded single-day case highs on three consecutive days. There were 169 cases reported Jan. 6, 197 reported Jan. 7 and 210 reported Jan. 8. The previous single-day high was 143 on Aug. 31.
Wayne County had not had three consecutive days with triple-figure cases until Dec. 28-30, but all seven days Jan. 3-9 had between 103 and 210 cases. On Jan. 6, the county exceeded 14,000 cases overall. Add in the next three days and the total had climbed to 14,695 cases. There also have been 294 COVID-related deaths among county residents.
There were 13 days between when the county surpassed 13,000 cases and when it crossed the 14,000 plateau, which matched the shortest period needed to move from one plateau to the next. At the current rate, the county could advance from 14,000 cases to 15,000 cases in half that time.
Through nine January days, 1,150 cases and seven deaths have been reported. The case total already ranks January sixth among all months of the pandemic. There were 1,784 cases reported both during September 2021 and November 2020, according to the state's revised day-by-day totals.
Monday's state report also showed Wayne County's seven-day positivity rate at 17.7%. That would be enough for the county to score red when the state releases weekly metric scores Wednesday. Wayne County has previously only scored red once, when the state issued its Sept. 8 metric scores, and spent two weeks in the red advisory level.
Statewide, the positivity rate was reported at 25.9% Monday. Surrounding counties also have rates at more than 15%, which would score red. Randolph is at 16.0%, Henry at 19.6%, Union at 22.7% and Franklin at 28.4%. Only Fayette at 14.5% remains less than 15%.
The case and death totals for the other area counties are:
Darke County: 9,775 positive cases and 192 deaths;
Henry County: 10,684 positives and 190 deaths;
Fayette County: 5,399 positives and 115 deaths;
Franklin County: 3,526 positives and 48 deaths;
Preble County: 7,402 positives and 155 deaths;
Randolph County: 4,699 positives and 123 deaths;
Union County: 1,503 positives and 18 deaths.
Indiana has recorded 1,366,754 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases and 19,084 COVID-related deaths through Sunday. The Ohio Department of Health's Sunday update reported 2,189,228 cases and 30,072 deaths.
More than half of Wayne County's population has now received at least some COVID-19 vaccine more than a year after the first vaccine was introduced. There are 30,555 fully vaccinated Wayne County residents, according to the state, which is about 46.4% of the population.
Another 2,504 residents have received at least one dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines. That means about 50.2% of county residents have received at least some vaccine.
Last week, 183 more residents became fully vaccinated, an decrease of 13.7% from the previous week, and 261 received a first Pfizer or Moderna dose, a weekly increase of 7.9%.
The state reports 8,754,651 vaccine doses administered to Indiana residents. Of those, 1,497,274 (17.1%) have been booster shots.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now recommends a booster shot five months after receiving the Pfizer or Moderna regimen or two months after receiving the Johnson & Johnson shot.
A booster increases the vaccines' effectiveness against the Omicron variant from about 35% to about 75%, according to Reid Health. The hospital on Monday reported 52 patients in its COVID-19 containment areas, with 10 in the intensive care unit and nine on ventilators. Of the 52 COVID-19 patients, 15 are vaccinated, while three in intensive care and two on ventilators are vaccinated.

You’re trying to log into Canvas on a Saturday afternoon, have no intentions of going on campus, yet still, a white and yellow screen prefaces the Canvas main menu. This screen? Rowan’s daily COVID-19 screening.
Three simple questions are all that the screening asks. Do you plan on visiting Rowan‘s campus today? Do you have any coronavirus symptoms? Have you been exposed to anyone with Coronavirus?
It is no test, of course, but many students have other questions that are left unanswered. 
Scott Woodside, director for the Wellness Center, answers these burning questions.
According to Woodside, “The daily screening is tied to any central authentication service to ensure as many students and employees complete the daily attestation. Additionally, reminders for those not completing the screening goes out early in the morning.”
Woodside also noted that the daily screening is not specific to Canvas, as said, it is “tied to any central authentication,” which includes, and is not limited to, Proflink and Banner.
Woodside went on to further explain where the data that has been collected is going stating, “It serves two purposes. One, it reminds all Rowan community members of the importance of monitoring symptoms and not being around others when sick. And second, the Health Metrics team, that meets weekly, reviews the data for trends to help make decisions about the campus.”
The Health Metrics team is, as Woodside mentioned, “… an internal team that meets weekly. It includes key leaders across campus. And our disease experts form Rowan Medicine and CMSRU.”
The data itself, according to Woodside, is “securely on a banner admin site. Only myself [Scott Woodside] and a few others helping with contact tracing have access.”
On Rowan University’s webpage, under “Rowan Today,” students can find a link titled “Vaccination Rates” that leads them to vaccination rates for both, in-person students and residential students. 
According to the data, students taking in-person classes, out of an estimated 18,400 students, 87.1% (about 16,026 students) are vaccinated, 8.6% (about 1,582 students) are exempt from the vaccine, and 4.3% (about 791 students) have not responded. The commuter population comes out to a total of 16,573 students. 
Meanwhile, out of the 5,418 residential students, 89.5% (about 4,849 students) are vaccinated, 7.8% (about 423 students) are exempt from the vaccine, and 2.7% (about 146 students) have not responded. 
Until further notice, the COVID-19 screening, that students must take daily, isn’t going anywhere.

156,"Sonoma County is ending the use of the Holiday Inn in Windsor as a temporary homeless shelter during the coronavirus pandemic.
Since June, the county has housed 30 to 40 unsheltered people who, though they have not been diagnosed with COVID-19, were considered at high risk of serious complications should they contract the virus. The hotel is located at 8755 Old Redwood Highway in Windsor.
No additional people will be admitted to shelter rooms as the county winds down operations. It may take until March to find a place for each current resident to live, according to information received by the town.
The county’s contract was set to run through the end of the year. The county is spending $3.2 million for homeless services, or $139 a day for each room occupied, at the Windsor hotel, Matt Brown, a county spokesman, said in May.
The Holiday Inn was one of five area lodging properties that the county is spending millions to either lease or acquire to house homeless residents.

157,"Publication: Cornell Daily Sun, , Cornell University , Ithaca, NYWith a heavy financial toll of COVID-19 on universities across the board, graduate programs are altering their operations, and some are not accepting students this year.
Following a trend of similar decisions across college campuses, Cornell’s former director of graduate studies, Prof. Raymond Craib, history, recently decided to suspend graduate student applications for the 2021-2022 academic year.
The main reason for the suspension, according to Prof. Claudia Verhoeven, director of graduate studies of the history department, was to save financial packages normally used for new admits to support current graduate students during the pandemic.

“It was both sad and tragic to have to push back admissions, but I think people generally found it more of a priority to support those in the department first,” said Manuel Berduc, grad.
Last April, Cornell’s history graduate students sent the department a collective letter, according to Benedetta Luciana Sara Carnaghi, grad. In it, the students voiced the ways in which the pandemic had impacted them and called on the department to support them.
Unlike his friends in other departments who have not been as lucky, the extra funding has benefited Berduc and his classmates in ways he had not expected. Historians, according to Berduc, are generally expected to do fieldwork in archives, often located abroad, which has proven to be difficult during the pandemic.

The admissions policy change has given the department flexibility to move financial packages around, replacing travel grants with support funds to finish their research projects and write their dissertations.
Berduc was forced to alter his course because of social distancing requirements. Unable to access many of the books required for his original research topic, he significantly modified his research focus around the few books within his reach. Last summer, he also had to complete his A Exam, comprehensive exams for PhD students, without access to library resources.
The history department plans to resume applications next year, hoping to bounce back from the decision Verhoeven referred to as an “emergency measure.”

According to Verhoeven, there hasn’t been back-lash from prospective students. She said that many prospective students are postponing their studies for a year so they can still plan to come to Cornell. Current students seem to be happy with this decision, as they are able to get the financial support they need during the pandemic.
In other departments, the pandemic has simply meant axing in-person events. Dnyanesh Kulkarni, grad, said that many STEM applicants have been unable to benefit from welcome events that traditionally allow them to “shop around” for graduate school programs in normal years — the physics department, where Kulkarni is pursuing his PhD, had to cancel its flagship “Visitor Weekend” for incoming students.
While the pandemic has impacted current graduate students, it also affected admissions for prospective students.
Logan Hoffman-Smith is one of many students who has applied to a Cornell graduate school during the pandemic. Seeking a spot in Cornell’s Master of Fine Arts program in Creative Writing, they are currently on the waitlist.
Applying during a pandemic presented several challenges, including difficulty connecting with other writers, but it allowed more time for them to refine work and complete applications.
“I actually think applying was an easier process because I had so much more time on my hands,” Hoffman-Smith said.
They noted that the waiting period between applications and acceptances looks different this year, since many schools changed their deadlines and requirements.
Kulkarni expressed the privilege that graduate students have enjoyed from a broader societal perspective, as they continued to work, research and earn a living in their chosen course of study.
“There are wrinkles that have affected all of us,” he said. “But by and large, I feel grateful.”

160,"GREEN BAY - Going into the 2021 season, the Green Bay Packers have convinced themselves they have something special in quarterback Jordan Love.
They have come to this conclusion because there is so much on the line with the 2020 first-round pick and not because there is a preponderance of evidence that he is the real deal.
There is a lot you can learn about a quarterback over 60 regular-season and 28 training camp practices, which is exactly the number Love has taken part in during his 16 months with the club. He missed out on in-person, offseason workouts during his rookie season because of COVID-19 but received starter's attention this offseason while Aaron Rodgers boycotted workouts during his feud with general manager Brian Gutekunst.
But there is no way the Packers can say for sure that Love is headed for stardom based on the recently concluded training camp, which included 14 practices (he missed four due to a right rotator-cuff strain) and two exhibition games (he missed one for the same reason).
He threw roughly 200 passes in 11-on-11 action and completed just over 60% of them based on game totals and passing statistics PackersNews compiled during training camp. He threw six interceptions and completed eight touchdown passes, although the latter isn't that revealing since most training camp work is situational and not aimed at moving the ball down the field.
There was nothing extraordinary with his work in 2-minute drills — although he threw touchdown passes of 47 and 41 yards — and he converted only about 40% of his third-down throws.
In many ways, Love looked like the guy the Packers should expect after a truncated rookie season and just two games and one full practice of live action. He displays a calm demeanor, a strong arm and good athletic ability, but he's all about potential at this stage of his career.
""I thought he had a fantastic camp,"" Gutekunst said Wednesday. ""I really did. Obviously, he had a little bit of a pause. And then missing time (due to the injury), which would have been nice for him to have, but I thought he did an excellent job really.
""You saw the growth we needed to see and it was exciting. For me, obviously, nothing's perfect. And there's definitely some things in there that I think he'll take from this preseason with him as he goes. But no, I thought it was fantastic.""
No one could blame Gutekunst for seeing things through Love-tinted glasses given all that is riding on his draft decision last year. His starting quarterback threw a scare into the franchise this offseason and probably will be playing somewhere else next season because of the Love selection.
But deep down, the Packers must be very nervous about the prospect of Love being their backup quarterback this season because even though there is a lot of talent, he is still very rough around the edges. His throws often belie his arm strength, floating to their target instead of slicing through the open spaces.
It will be critical for the coaches to continue to focus on his footwork and willingness to drive the ball down the field.
""The most important thing for any young quarterback, especially for 'J,' is the footwork,"" Rodgers said. ""And when he throws a ball on time, he's a very accurate quarterback. You know if there's any type of clutter with progression, or read or whatever, for any of us, any quarterback, when you're not throwing the ball in rhythm, it becomes more difficult to be accurate and be effective.
""He just needs to trust his footwork and go out and play in rhythm.""
If there was one noticeable weakness in Love's game, it was throwing the deep ball. He completed very few of them in practice and the ones he did were usually to players who were wide open. More often, the balls were underthrown with too much air under them, perhaps the grounds for coach Matt LaFleur saying that he really wanted to see Love ""let it rip"" more often.
His longest of 24 completions in the games was 34 yards, a seam route to tight end Jace Sternberger against Houston. His worst deep attempt was an ill-advised, falling-to-the-ground heave to the end zone that Buffalo safety Micah Hyde easily picked off.
Another area of weakness was third down. He connected on some sizable gains, but in the games just four of his 11 third-down passes resulted in first downs and in practice just 14 of his 36 were converted.
All totaled in the games, he completed 24 of 35 passes for 271 yards and a touchdown with an interception (89.1 rating), playing 11 series with the No. 2 offense. The series results were five punts, a touchdown, an interception, a missed field goal, a fumble and two ending on downs.
""For his first live action since Utah State (in 2019), I thought he was very calm, poised,"" Gutekunst said. ""I thought he was able to get in and out of a place that Matt wanted to get in and out of, and I didn't think the rush bothered him.
""But he kept his eyes downfield, he actually made some really good throws. And there were some moments in there that he'll look back on and grow from. But at the same time, I just think he moved the team.""
A year ago, Love entered the season as the No. 3 behind Rodgers and Tim Boyle and his snaps in practice were shared with Boyle on the scout team. It's a far cry from the snaps and attention he got running LaFleur's offense in training camp, although quarterbacks coach Luke Getsy worked with him every day on improving his mechanics and footwork.
This year, as the No. 2, Love will receive all the scout team snaps and whatever snaps with the No. 1 offense Rodgers chooses to relinquish.
During his three seasons sitting behind Brett Favre, Rodgers turned his scout-team work into a game-day challenge. Every practice was his game day and he sought to embarrass his own defense, for which he was supposed to be preparing for its upcoming opponent.
If Love is going to make strides during the regular season, he'll have to do it on the scout team.
""Those are leadership opportunities,"" Getsy said. ""So, he's going to command the huddle. He's going to have the guys looking at him, he's going to talk about the play that they're going to run. And he's going to ask things of those guys and demand things of those guys in that huddle.
""And then we try to do our best to make every play similar to what we do on our offense. So, he's going to get to play the plays, the way we play him, the way we talk about them the way we read them out.""
Week to week, Love's job this season will be different than a year ago. Besides running the scout team, he's going to be expected to provide Rodgers with insights in game preparation and on-field developments the same way Boyle did for three seasons.
Like Rodgers did when he was behind Favre, Love is going to have to play the mental side of the game in his head every week, preparing as though he'll be the starter even though he might not do anything but conduct kneel-downs at the end of games.
""The mental side of it, he's got to dominate,"" Getsy said. ""And on the practice field, he's got to dominate and take advantage of all those repetitions that he'll get against our defense or in those moments he'll take reps for our offense.
""I mean, he's got a lot of work to do. And I think there's a lot of opportunities to grow mentally and physically as we go through the season.""
It would be nice for the Packers if he were further along, but the reality is it's all about potential with Love and until he starts a regular-season game, no one can say for sure whether his future is as bright as Gutekunst says it is.

162,"WOODCLIFF LAKE, N.J., June 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Eisai Inc., the U.S. pharmaceutical subsidiary of Eisai Co., Ltd., announced today new presentations featuring the latest data about the company's insomnia medication DAYVIGO (lemborexant) will be presented at the 35th annual SLEEP 2021 meeting of the Associated Professional Sleep Societies, LLC (APSS). SLEEP is a joint venture of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) and the Sleep Research Society (SRS) and which will be held virtually from June 10 to June 13, 2021.
""We look forward to presenting new findings from key DAYVIGO clinical studies that we believe provide key considerations for treating patients with insomnia,"" said Ivan Cheung, Chairman, Eisai Inc. and Global President, Neurology Business Group, Eisai Co., Ltd. ""Since its launch one year ago, DAYVIGO has been an important addition to Eisai's rapidly growing neurology portfolio, and we remain committed to helping insomnia patients especially during COVID may have been impacted.""
DAYVIGO (lemborexant) is a small-molecule compound, discovered and developed by Eisai in-house scientists, that inhibits orexin signaling by binding competitively to both orexin receptor subtypes (orexin receptor 1 and 2). DAYVIGO is an orexin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and /or sleep maintenance. In individuals with normal daily sleep-wake rhythms, orexin signaling is believed to promote periods of wakefulness. In individuals with insomnia, it is possible that orexin signaling regulating wakefulness is not functioning normally. 
The full list of virtual presentations is included below. All presentations will be available to registered participants via SLEEP 2021 Home – SLEEP Meeting from the start of the meeting. Posters will be displayed 24-hours a day in the ePoster gallery from Friday, June 11 through Tuesday, November 30, 2021.

DAYVIGO (lemborexant) is an orexin receptor antagonist indicated for the treatment of adult patients with insomnia, characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance.
IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
CONTRAINDICATIONSDAYVIGO is contraindicated in patients with narcolepsy.
WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSCentral Nervous System (CNS) Depressant Effects and Daytime Impairment: DAYVIGO can impair daytime wakefulness. CNS depressant effects may persist in some patients up to several days after discontinuing DAYVIGO. Prescribers should advise patients about the potential for next-day somnolence.
Driving ability was impaired in some subjects taking DAYVIGO 10 mg. Risk of daytime impairment is increased if DAYVIGO is taken with less than a full night of sleep remaining or at a higher than recommended dose. If taken in these circumstances, patients should not drive or engage in activities requiring mental alertness.
Use with other classes of CNS depressants (e.g., benzodiazepines, opioids, tricyclic antidepressants, alcohol) increases the risk of CNS depression, which can cause daytime impairment. Dosage adjustments of DAYVIGO and concomitant CNS depressants may be necessary when administered together. Use of DAYVIGO with other insomnia drugs is not recommended. Patients should be advised not to consume alcohol in combination with DAYVIGO.
Because DAYVIGO can cause drowsiness, patients, particularly the elderly, are at a higher risk of falls.
Sleep Paralysis, Hypnagogic/Hypnopompic Hallucinations, and Cataplexy-Like Symptoms:Sleep paralysis, an inability to move or speak for up to several minutes during sleep-wake transitions, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, including vivid and disturbing perceptions can occur with DAYVIGO. Prescribers should explain these events to patients.
Symptoms similar to mild cataplexy can occur with DAYVIGO and can include periods of leg weakness lasting from seconds to a few minutes, can occur either at night or during the day, and may not be associated with identified triggering event (e.g., laughter or surprise).
Complex Sleep Behaviors:Complex sleep behaviors, including sleep-walking, sleep-driving, and engaging in other activities while not fully awake (e.g., preparing and eating food, making phone calls, having sex), have been reported to occur with the use of hypnotics such as DAYVIGO. Events can occur in hypnotic-naïve and hypnotic-experienced persons. Patients usually do not remember these events. Complex sleep behaviors may occur following the first or any subsequent use of DAYVIGO, with or without the concomitant use of alcohol and other CNS depressants. Discontinue DAYVIGO immediately if a patient experiences a complex sleep behavior.
Patients with Compromised Respiratory Function:The effect of DAYVIGO on respiratory function should be considered for patients with compromised respiratory function. DAYVIGO has not been studied in patients with moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Worsening of Depression/Suicidal Ideation:Incidence of suicidal ideation or suicidal behavior, as assessed by questionnaire, was higher in patients receiving DAYVIGO than placebo (0.3% for DAYVIGO 10 mg, 0.4% for DAYVIGO 5 mg, and 0.2% for placebo).
In primarily depressed patients treated with hypnotics, worsening of depression and suicidal thoughts and actions (including completed suicides) have been reported. Suicidal tendencies may be present in such patients and protective measures may be required. Intentional overdose is more common in this group of patients; therefore, the lowest number of tablets that is feasible should be prescribed at any one time. 
The emergence of any new behavioral sign or symptom of concern requires careful and immediate evaluation.
Need to Evaluate for Comorbid Diagnoses:Treatment of insomnia should be initiated only after careful evaluation of the patient. Reevaluate for comorbid conditions if insomnia persists or worsens after 7 to 10 days of treatment. Worsening of insomnia or the emergence of new cognitive or behavioral abnormalities may be the result of an unrecognized underlying psychiatric or medical disorder and can emerge during the course of treatment with sleep-promoting drugs such as DAYVIGO.
ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reaction (reported in 5% of patients treated with DAYVIGO and at least twice the rate of placebo) with DAYVIGO was somnolence (10% for DAYVIGO 10 mg, 7% for DAYVIGO 5 mg, 1% for placebo).
DRUG INTERACTIONS
CYP3A Inhibitors: The maximum recommended dose of DAYVIGO is 5 mg no more than once per night when co-administered with weak CYP3A inhibitors. Avoid concomitant use of DAYVIGO with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors.
CYP3A Inducers: Avoid concomitant use of DAYVIGO with moderate or strong CYP3A inducers.
USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSPregnancy and Lactation: There is a pregnancy exposure registry that monitors pregnancy outcomes in women who are exposed to DAYVIGO during pregnancy.
Healthcare providers are encouraged to register patients in the DAYVIGO pregnancy registry by calling 1-888-274-2378. There are no available data on DAYVIGO use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug-associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage, or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes.
There are no data on the presence of lemborexant in human milk, the effects on the breastfed infant, or the effects on milk production. Infants exposed to DAYVIGO through breastmilk should be monitored for excess sedation.
Geriatric Use: Exercise caution when using doses higher than 5 mg in patients ≥65 years old.
Renal Impairment: Patients with severe renal impairment may experience an increased risk of somnolence.
Hepatic Impairment: The maximum recommended dose of DAYVIGO is 5 mg in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. DAYVIGO is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with mild hepatic impairment may experience an increased risk of somnolence.
DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCEDAYVIGO is a Schedule IV-controlled substance. 
Because individuals with a history of abuse or addiction to alcohol or other drugs may be at increased risk for abuse and addiction to DAYVIGO, follow such patients carefully.

THE HAGUE, Netherlands - In the face of demonstrations across much of Europe protesting tough COVID-19 measures over the past days, authorities on Monday pleaded for patience, calm and a willingness to get a vaccine shot in the arm as infections spike upward again.
Protest marches from Zagreb to Rome and from Vienna to Brussels and Rotterdam, bringing tens of thousands out, all had one message from a coronavirus-weary crowd - we've had enough!
Government leaders and European Union officials all made clear on Monday that a return to bygone days was still out of the question and that the violence at some of the marches was counterproductive.
Much of the discontent, however, is targeted at politicians who had promised that vaccinations would bring freedom. With the delta variant making sure contagion remains rampant, EU governments are being forced to reimpose constraints and - in some countries - slap tougher restrictions on the non-vaccinated.
""The rising numbers are unfortunately fueling vaccine hesitancy, and we all need to take a firm stand against this,"" said EU Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides. However, she said the spike is mainly to blame on those who refuse to have a shot.
""But now we are facing a pandemic mainly driven by the unvaccinated,"" Kyriakides said.
Breakthrough infections and deaths among the vaccinated happen, though at far lower rates, according to officials.
On Monday, Austrians awoke to the start of their fourth national lockdown of this pandemic. Under the lockdown, people can leave their homes only for specific reasons, including buying groceries, going to the doctor or exercising.
Day care centers and schools remained open for those who need them, but parents were asked to keep children at home if possible.
Rutte condemned rioters in Rotterdam and across the Netherlands after coronavirus protests there and in Brussels descended into violence amid simmering anger at lockdown measures being put into place in an attempt to rein in soaring rates of infection.
Late Friday, police in Rotterdam even used live fire to disperse rioters gone amok, and four people suffered gunshot wounds. Altogether in both countries almost 100 people were detained.
""I realize that there are a lot of tensions in society because we have been dealing with all the misery of coronavirus for so long,"" Rutte said. But he stressed the rioters were something completely different, producing ""a pure explosion of violence directed against our police, against our firefighters, against ambulance drivers.""
Scenes were ugly too at the end of the Brussels protest march, with rioters pelting police, who then used tear gas and water cannons to break up the crowds.
""Our goal today is to fight against the virus. Please, let us not get incited by a small group which would turn it into a fight against one another,"" Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo said.
The protests come as a fourth wave of infections is locking down Austrians and forcing renewed restraints in many European nations on anything from working in the office to drinking at bars.
The Dutch violence came a week into a new partial lockdown in the Netherlands and after an announcement that the government was banning fireworks on New Year's Eve in an effort to ease the strain on hospital emergency rooms. In riots across the country, youths threw fireworks at police officers.
The EU pointed out that scientific evidence shows that increased vaccinations would contain the crisis and avoid more deaths.
""You know the three words very well - vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,"" said spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker.

168,"Apr. 20 - Spring football is in its final week, the transfer portal still is spinning and the 2022 NFL draft is a week away.
There's plenty to talk about in this week's Open Jim mailbag, so let's get going.
If you haven't already, please click this link to become a print and/or digital member. You're also invited to follow me on Twitter and Facebook, where you also can join our Wisconsin Badgers fan group.

The two frontcourt players UW has been connected with the most are both Wisconsin natives.
Grant Basile, a 6-foot-9 forward from Pewaukee, averaged 18.4 points and 8.5 rebounds at Wright State last season. Ben Vander Plas, a 6-8 forward from Ripon, averaged 14.2 points and 6.8 rebounds last season at Ohio.
Basile has two seasons of eligibility remaining, while Vander Plas has just one.
Both players reportedly have made visits to campus. Basile's finalists are UW, Iowa State, Notre Dame and Virginia Tech; Vander Plas is down to UW, Illinois, Iowa State, Ohio State, Virginia and Virginia Tech.
------
Player evaluation always has been  -  and always will be  -  a bit of an inexact science. Coaches can watch prospects play dozens of high school or AAU games and try to project how they'll fit at the college level, but nobody really knows for sure how it's going to turn out.
Let's use the two players mentioned in the previous answer as an example: Vander Plas was a 2017 recruit and redshirted his first season at Ohio. Same for Basile, a 2018 recruit, at Wright State. Both of them had fine careers at their respective mid-major programs, but I don't think UW misevaluated Vander Plas or Basile back when they were high school players in the state.
It makes a lot of sense that UW would try to add one of them to the roster next season because Vander Plas and Basile fill an area of need. Ditto for Kamari McGee, who spent a season at UW-Green Bay before announcing earlier this month that he was transferring to UW. It wouldn't have made sense for the Badgers to recruit McGee as part of the 2021 recruiting class because they already had Chucky Hepburn. But adding McGee now makes sense because he adds depth following the departure of backup point guard Lorne Bowman II.
------
It'll be easier to answer this question in a few weeks once the roster is (hopefully) settled. My answer could change depending on who gets added through the transfer portal.
I think the three returning starters  -  Tyler Wahl, Hepburn and Steven Crowl  -  are all going to make jumps and have to do that. Johnny Davis and Brad Davison combined for 46.6% of UW's scoring last season, and that void needs to be filled now that both have moved on.
But you seem to be wondering whether an unproven player will make a jump.
I think the two biggest candidates are Jahcobi Neath and Jordan Davis. One or both of them will have a jump in minutes now that Johnny Davis and Davison are gone. Neath dealt with a knee injury all season and is recovering from offseason surgery, while Jordan Davis could take on an expanded role now that his twin brother is off to the NBA.
Could Neath and/or Davis make a jump? Yes, I believe so.
But my answer would change if UW adds an impact wing in the transfer portal and Neath and Davis remain role players.
------
I'd be shocked.
You never can have enough point guards on the roster, but UW is covered at that spot with Hepburn.
I like Hunter's ability to create for himself and others. But I think finding a wing  -  preferably one who can shoot  -  is a much bigger need on this roster.
------
I think it'd be hard to get that genie back in the bottle.
The first step has to be establishing some rules with name, image and likeness because right now there doesn't seem to be much order.
------
As I've said, I think UW is a year away from being a legitimate Big Ten title contender and I believe Graham Mertz can be the quarterback who helps the Badgers get there.
But first things first: Mertz needs to take a significant step forward this season or else UW needs to take another look in the transfer portal next offseason.
This is going to sound like I'm making excuses for Mertz but really they're just factors I've considered while watching his less-than-encouraging performance this spring: UW's offense has a new look after a coordinator change and he's got a lot of new pieces  -  players and staff  -  around him. I'm not ready to hit the panic button, but check back in mid-August.
I don't think Chase Wolf is the answer and the two young quarterbacks on the roster  -  Deacon Hill and Myles Burkett  -  aren't ready yet.
------
There's a lot to unpack here, but I'll try.
Is what UW coach Paul Chryst did unconventional? Yes, there's no question about that, and I wrote at the start of spring ball that he's taking some big chances.
But there's a line in that column that provides an answer even if it's not what fans want to hear: Chryst tried to put together the best staff he could even if it meant some of the positional fits seem awkward.
As an aside, it's interesting to me that New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick filled the void of offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels leaving by adding Matt Patricia and Joe Judge to his offensive staff. Patricia has been a defensive coach most of his career, while Judge spent one season as a wide receivers coach but primarily has dealt with special teams.
It seems like an odd fit but, well, it's Bill Belichick and he's earned the benefit of the doubt.
As for Chryst, I get why fans are uneasy about some of these moves. But I think there's reason for optimism.
I like that he moved Mickey Turner to the head of the recruiting department. That's a crucial role and Turner is bright, energetic and knows the program.
I also like that Chryst has taken a step back and won't be coaching a position or coordinating the offense. He certainly will have input in that department, but now he'll have more time to work with coaches and interact with players at all positions.
This is a transitional period for the tight ends, and I would have liked it better if Chryst had put someone with experience at that position in that role rather than Haering. But Chryst and Haering are close, so it's no surprise the latter remains on the staff.
------
1. Chimere Dike
2. Skyler Bell
3. Keontez Lewis
4. Markus Allen
5. Dean Engram
That's a pretty young group, but I think it's got a lot of potential.
------
UW athletic director Chris McIntosh at least seems more open to the idea but don't get your hopes up: It's not happening, at least anytime soon.
Here's what McIntosh told my colleague Todd Milewski during a question-and-answer session last fall:
""At this moment in time, I would tell you this: Since the start of COVID and as we emerged from that and as we head into all the change we've been talking about, our priority right now is to focus on maximizing the opportunity, both in terms of participation and the student-athlete opportunity for the 23 sports we have,"" McIntosh said.
""I won't make predictions about what on the other side of all this change we could look like. But right now our priority is to do the best by the student-athletes we have and the programs we have.""
Side note: I checked the Big Ten baseball standings and Rutgers is in first place with an 11-1 mark in conference play and a 31-6 overall record.
------
The Packers have five picks in the first three rounds, including two apiece in the first and second rounds. That's a chance to get a handful of impact players in the first 92 picks.
Finding multiple pass-catchers  -  two wide receivers; or a receiver and a tight end  -  has to be the No. 1 priority. I'd like to see Green Bay find an edge rusher in those first two days as well.
------
I'd like to see the Packers address the tight end spot in the first two days. But depending on how that shakes out, grabbing Jake Ferguson in, say, the fifth or sixth round makes some sense.

169,"The Canadian Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada issued the following news release on March 16, 2021:Canadians have demonstrated a remarkable ability to mobilize in response to the COVID 19 pandemic. Companies in the biomanufacturing space from coast to coast to coast have answered the call, and the government wants to recognize their work. To date, the Government of Canada has made investments of approximately $1 billion to advance industrial research and development in vaccines and pharmaceuticals, as well as biomanufacturing capacity. We will continue to partner with Canadian industry and businesses to protect Canadians from COVID-19 while building new biomanufacturing capacity as part of our recovery plan.Today, the Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, announced major investments in Canadian firms through the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), which will collectively serve to strengthen biomanufacturing and drug development capacity in Canada. As part of these investments: * KABS Laboratories Inc. will receive a contribution of up to $54.2 million for the expansion of its Saint-Hubert facility and the establishment of a new facility in Val-des-Sources, both in Quebec. The expansion of its Saint-Hubert facility will allow for additional fill and finish capacity to exceed 30 million vials per year. Meanwhile, the new facility in Val-des-Sources will house bioprocessing and testing equipment to offer new antibody manufacturing capacity. As a result, KABS Laboratories will be able to produce monoclonal antibody therapies in Val-des-Sources and then fill and package them in Saint-Hubert.* Novocol Pharmaceutical of Canada will receive a contribution of up to $32.7 million to expand its biomanufacturing facilities in Cambridge, Ontario. This investment will support the expansion of Novocol's fill-finish services to strengthen Canada's long-term response through improved pandemic preparedness for vaccines and therapies. It is through the fill-finish process that vials are filled with vaccines or therapeutics and packaged for distribution.* Immune Biosolutions, located in Sherbrooke, Quebec, will receive a contribution of up to $13.44 million to help develop and advance its therapeutic candidate from preclinical studies through to Phase II clinical trials. Immune Biosolutions' therapeutic candidate will seek to treat COVID-19 by neutralizing the virus. In addition, Immune Biosolutions will establish clinical scale biomanufacturing capacity and develop a new accelerated discovery process that will support future biologics and discovery work.These investments and other actions we have taken are informed by the recommendations of the COVID-19 Therapeutics Task Force and COVID-19 Joint Biomanufacturing Subcommittee.$150 million for development of promising clinical candidatesThe government is also demonstrating its ongoing support for made-in-Canada vaccines and therapeutics to combat COVID-19 with an investment of $150 million to help companies advance through the early stages of research and development. Through the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP), six vaccine candidates and seven therapeutic candidates have already received advisory support and more than $37 million in funding. The remaining $113 million is available to help the most promising of these candidates advance to the next phase of clinical development. NRC IRAP is working closely with these companies so that COVID-19 variants are considered as part of their solutions.Quotes""Canada's biomanufacturing sector is rich in knowledge and expertise. By investing in domestic biomanufacturing facilities and equipment, such as KABS Laboratories, Novocol and Immune Biosolutions, we are investing in made-in-Canada solutions to fight COVID-19 while retaining and developing the expertise necessary to help us secure vaccine and therapy supply chains here at home. Our government is committed to rebuilding Canada's biomanufacturing sector, focusing on both short-term strategic solutions and a long-term vision.""The Honourable Francois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry""We are very grateful for this important strategic support that is catalyzing our commitment to the Canadian bioprocessing and drug development effort.""Jean-Simon Blais, President, KABS Laboratories Inc.""Novocol is grateful for the support from the Government of Canada through the Strategic Innovation Fund. This investment will increase domestic biomanufacturing capacity for fill-finish of sterile injectables, including vaccines, therapeutics and a wide range of pharmaceuticals, in a state-of-the-art GMP facility expansion. By creating such capacity and capabilities, Novocol will contribute to strengthening Canada's preparedness for future pandemics, as well as create skilled jobs and economic development in the country's biopharmaceutical ecosystem. As a CDMO--a contract development and manufacturing organization--our investment will provide valuable services to support Canadian and foreign biopharmaceutical innovators, starting from clinical trial materials through to commercial scale manufacturing.""Olivier Schiller, CEO of Novocol Pharma's French-based parent company Septodont""This financial support will drastically accelerate the preclinical and clinical development of our promising antibody candidates.

171,"Public schools across the country that saw a dip in enrollment due to COVID-19 concerns are trying to entice wary parents back before the next school year begins — not only for the students' sakes but in some cases to save jobs.
Some are hosting early back-to-school nights, while others like Glendale Elementary School in Arizona are putting together a drive-thru kindergarten readiness event. 
""Our goal is just trying to get kids here and get families back at William C. Jack School,"" Principal Denis Parcells told FOX10.
The school is offering preschool families registration packets and kindergarten goody bags in an effort to show that it is ready for a new batch of students. 
Unfortunately, it was too little, too late for another Arizona county. Gilbert Public Schools recently laid off 152 teachers and other employees, citing declining student enrollment. The employees were notified via email in late March.
STUDENTS LEFT BEHIND: BROTHERS HAD TOTALLY DIFFERENT LOCKDOWN LIVES
""This afternoon we made the very difficult decision to implement a necessary reduction in force for the 2021/22 school year as a result of loss of student enrollment,"" the email, obtained by AZcentral.com, said. 
""Gilbert Public Schools, along with many other school districts, faces a reduced number of students going into the next school year following the global pandemic,"" the message read. ""We continue to make every effort to increase enrollment for next year and it is our hope that many students lost during this pandemic will return to our schools over the next year."" 
Gilbert Public Schools has seen a year-over-year loss of 1,600 students, spokeswoman Dawn Antestenis said. 
The district employs just over 2,000 people. 
The Arizona Department of Education recently released a report that showed a decline in enrollment across the board of about 38,000 students. However, of that, 40% of the decline came from kindergarten and preschool programs. 
The state's decrease in enrollment tracks with others around the country that shut their doors amid coronavirus lockdowns and have struggled to reopen safely for in-person classes.
Elementary schools in Buffalo, New York, are seeing a 45% decrease in prekindergarten enrollment as well as declines in suburban districts. While the number of pre-K students is down across the entire state, Buffalo's numbers are more than double the state average of 19%. 
In Texas, there was a reported 33% drop in pre-K enrollment in the Austin area in January, according to E3Alliance, a regional, data-driven education collaborative based in the city. 
The beginning of the 2020 school year was marked by multiple changes in reopening plans as well as widespread confusion from teachers, administrators, parents, and students. More than a year on, there are still concerns about safety and worries about unequal access to technology. 
Across the country, there was an exodus from public school rolls that some feared could become a national crisis. According to data from 33 states obtained by Chalkbeat and the Associated Press, public K-12 enrollment this past fall has dropped by more than 2%.
The swing is significant because enrollment overall had been going up by a half a percent in recent years. The decline could have an impact going forward for school budgets that are dependent on headcounts. 
Pedro Noguera, the dean of the University of Southern California's Rossier School of Education, told Chalkbeat that a bigger concern is that the thousands of children who are no longer attending class could be deprived of education learning altogether. 
“I would like to hope that many of them are from homes where their parents have taken responsibility on their own to provide for their education,” Noguera said, adding that affluent families will have an easier time doing that. “My fear is that large numbers have simply gotten discouraged and given up.”
Another factor playing into declining enrollment is the popularity of home schooling.  While it's no surprise the number of families choosing to go the home-school route swelled during the pandemic, the number of home-schoolers doubled in 2020. 
New data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows that between April 25 and May 5, 2020, the census reported 5.4% of all U.S. households with school-age children were home schooling. That number jumped to 11.1% of households by fall. 
“It’s clear that in an unprecedented environment, families are seeking solutions that will reliably meet their health and safety needs, their childcare needs and the learning and socio-emotional needs of their children,"" the Census Bureau's Household Pulse Survey said.
Home schooling differed by race and region, the report found.

Alaska went from 9.6% of households to 27.5% of households. In Florida, the rate jumped from 5% to 18.1%, and it grew in Vermont from 4.1% to 16.9%.

173,"(TNSRep) -- The American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine issued the following news release:Celebrating the continued increase in representation of female osteopathic medical students, the American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine (AACOM) today published its 2020 Applicant and Matriculant Profile Summary Report, showing record numbers of both women applicants and matriculants. The report analyzes data directly from osteopathic medical school applications submitted through the AACOM Application Services (AACOMAS) system. AACOMAS received 203,118 individual school applications from 30,308 applicants during the 2020 application cycle, which opened in May 2019 and closed in April 2020, with deadlines varying by college of osteopathic medicine (COM). COMs matriculated 8,280 of these applicants, who entered osteopathic medical school last summer.""AACOM is proud to see the continued growth and interest in osteopathic medical education (OME), particularly when a holistic approach to care is proving to be so important to the health of patients and communities,"" says AACOM President and CEO Robert A. Cain, DO. ""The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us the importance of community, and of the integrated health of body, mind and spirit. We are proud that osteopathic principles and practice continue to attract and inspire the next generation of doctors.""Record Number of Female ApplicantsThe 2020 application cycle is especially significant for the increase in applications and matriculations among women. More than half of 2020 applicants were women (53.4 percent, the largest ever documented), up from 52.6 percent in 2019. This is a notable increase, as 2019 was the first year since 2007 that women represented more than half of the osteopathic medical school applicant pool. More than half (51.9 percent) of 2020 matriculants were also women, up from 50.0 percent during the previous cycle.""AACOM is committed to making medical education more equitable for women, along with all populations traditionally underrepresented in medicine (URiM),"" adds Dr. Cain, ""Along with our individual colleges, we must do all we can to improve diversity, equity and inclusion within the OME community to ensure that we are educating future physicians who are fully representative of the communities they serve.""""It is so encouraging to see the overall osteopathic medical school application and matriculation rates increasing for women,"" says Robyn Phillips-Madson, DO, founding dean of the University of the Incarnate Word School of Osteopathic Medicine (UIWSOM). ""At UIWSOM, more than 65 percent of our 2020 matriculants were women, the largest percentage in the nation. Because the COVID-19 pandemic is causing an unprecedented number of women to leave the medical workforce, it is more imperative than ever that we educate more women today to become the DOs of tomorrow.""Students Underrepresented in MedicineWhile the number of women applicants rose, applications from URiM students slightly decreased to 15.4 percent in 2020, down from 15.5 percent in 2019. URiM students made up 11.1 percent of 2020 matriculants compared to 10.9 percent of 2019 matriculants.Fifteen percent of all 2020 matriculants were from economically disadvantaged families, 16.4 percent were from Health Professional Shortage Areas, 14.7 percent were first-generation students and 20.4 percent were from a small town (15.5 percent) or isolated rural area (4.9 percent), which all represent slight decreases from 2019.To improve the representation and success of URiM students, AACOM has been actively working to expand diversity in admissions among its entering classes. Since 2012, AACOM's Sherry R. Arnstein Minority Student Scholarship has granted financial awards to underrepresented osteopathic medical students, and in 2020, AACOM began pilot testing an Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Natural Language Processing model to support a more holistic review of applicants and help reduce dependence on MCAT scores and GPAs. AACOM also hosted the Diversity in Osteopathic Medicine Virtual Event (https://choosedo.org/event/diversity-in-osteopathic-medicine-virtual-event/#:~:text=September%2012%2C%202020%20%40%2012%3A,00%20pm%20%2D%206%3A00%20pm&text=While%20the%20emphasis%20of%20this,about%20osteopathic%20medicine%20to%20participate.) last September, expanded a fee waiver program to encourage financially disadvantaged students to become osteopathic physicians and added gender identity to the AACOMAS application.GPAs and MCAT Scores IncreaseUndergraduate total mean GPA for 2020 applicants was 3.49, up from 3.47 in 2019. The mean undergraduate total GPA for matriculants was 3.56.The total mean MCAT score for 2020 applicants was 503.19, an increase of 0.69 from 2019. The total mean MCAT score for matriculants was 504.29.""While GPAs and MCAT scores are certainly important indicators of a student's preparedness for medical education, they are by no means the only, or even the most effective, indicators,"" says AACOM Senior Vice President for Medical Education and Research Mark Speicher, PhD, MHA. ""Early beta tests of AACOM's new AI/Natural Language Processing model indicate that our AI software selected a pool of potential interview candidates that was less white and less male than the pool selected by human application reviewers. AACOM looks forward to the full results of our pilot test, which is currently being conducted with COM admissions programs at 14 COM campuses, and to reviewing the possible large-scale impacts of such a program and its potential to increase diversity in admissions.""* * *REPORT: https://www.aacom.org/docs/default-source/data-and-trends/2020-aacomas-applicant-matriculant-profile-summary-report.pdf?sfvrsn=d870497_8Joseph Shapiro, director of media relations, 240/938-0746, jshapiro@aacom.orgChristine DeCarlo, media and public affairs manager, 202/603-1026, cdecarlo@aacom.org[Category: Medical]T40-MgEditor-7589185 T40-MgEditor","American Association of Colleges of Osteopathic Medicine: Record Number of Women Apply, Matriculate to Osteopathic Medical School"

In December 2021, Chesapeake became the first company to certify all of its Haynesville natural gas operations jointly under the MiQ methane standard, and the EO100™ Standard for Responsible Energy Development, which covers a broad range of environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Over 840 continuous methane emissions monitoring devices have been placed in both Chesapeake's legacy Louisiana asset and in its newly acquired Vine acreage, which was certified under Project Canary's TrustWell certification process. 
In Pennsylvania, Chesapeake installed approximately 950 methane monitoring devices on its legacy acreage and expects to begin installing approximately 330 devices on its newly acquired Chief acreage in April 2022. Certification of its legacy Pennsylvania assets is expected to be completed by mid-year 2022 and by year-end 2022 on its newly acquired Chief acreage. As a result, the company expects to ultimately market over 6 billion cubic feet (bcf) of natural gas per day (over 3 bcf per day net) as certified Responsibly Sourced Gas (RSG) from both the Haynesville and Marcellus basins by year-end 2022.   
Chesapeake intends to invest over $30 million on ESG initiatives by year end 2022, including retrofitting more than 19,000 pneumatic devices which is expected to reduce reported GHG emissions by approximately 40% and methane emissions by approximately 80% enterprise wide.
Chesapeake also launched a new ESG microsite in December 2021, dedicated to the company's ESG reporting and progress toward its climate-related targets. In addition to providing performance data and program updates, the ESG site also provides details on the company's adoption of RSG, its commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion and a section dedicated to the company's revised executive compensation program that ties executive compensation to meeting specific ESG targets each year.

Fresh Start Accounting and Predecessor and Successor Periods
In connection with our emergence from bankruptcy on February 9, 2021, Chesapeake qualified for and applied fresh start accounting. In applying fresh start accounting, Chesapeake allocated its reorganization value to its individual assets based on their estimated fair values. Accordingly, the consolidated financial statements after February 9, 2021 are not comparable with the consolidated financial statements as of or prior to that date. References to ""Successor"" refer to the post-emergence reorganized Chesapeake after February 9, 2021, and references to ""Predecessor"" refer to pre-emergence Chesapeake for periods on or before February 9, 2021.
Headquartered in Oklahoma City, Chesapeake Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CHK) is powered by dedicated and innovative employees who are focused on discovering and responsibly developing our leading positions in top U.S. oil and gas plays. With a goal to achieve net-zero direct GHG emissions by 2035, Chesapeake is committed to safely answering the call for affordable, reliable, lower carbon energy.

A coalition of 180 rights groups on Wednesday called for a boycott of next year's Beijing Winter Olympics tied to reported human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in China. The games are to open Feb. 4, 2022, and are set to go forward despite the pandemic. The coalition is composed of groups representing Tibetans, Uighurs, Inner Mongolians, residents of Hong Kong and others. The group has issued an open letter to governments calling for a boycott of the Olympics ""to ensure they are not used to embolden the Chinese government's appalling rights abuses and crackdowns on dissent."" Rights groups have previously asked the IOC to move the games from China. Olympic leaders have largely ignored the demands and say it's only a sporting body that doesn't get involved with politics. The groups said because of the IOC's inaction ""it now falls on governments to take a stand and demonstrate that they have the political will to push back against China's reprehensible human rights abuses."" Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Olympics, which it promised would improve human rights in the country. Instead, the groups say the prestige of the Olympics has led to ""a gross increase on the assault on communities living under its rule.""
Hendrick Motorsports signed its first two sponsors for Kyle Larson as the 28-year-old driver attempts to rebuild his image after his use of a racial slur derailed his promising career. Cincinnati Inc., a machine tool maker, and heavy-duty truck manufacturer Freightliner will be the primary sponsors of Larson's new No. 5 Chevrolet for two races each in 2021. Both companies, existing Hendrick partners, will also be full-time associate sponsors for Larson. Rick Hendrick signed Larson late last year in an attempt to give Larson a second chance. The driver was expected to be NASCAR's top 2020 free agent but lost his job and all his sponsors after Larson used a racial slur while racing online in April. Larson was suspended the remainder of the NASCAR season but used the time educating himself on racial justice, volunteering with various causes and rebuilding his career. Hendrick is willing to fund Larson himself but believes companies will realign with the driver once he's shown he grew from his error.
Nearly a year after the ""Distance Insights Project"" declared that golfers are hitting the ball farther than ever, the game's two governing bodies on Tuesday announced three proposed changes to equipment and testing standards. One of the proposed changes includes a local rule that could limit the length of the shaft to no more than 46 inches, down from 48 inches. PGA Tour player Bryson DeChambeau has been testing a 48-inch driver, though he has yet to use it in competition. The USGA and R&A also proposed slight changes to how golf balls are tested for the distance standard and how drivers are tested to measure how much of a trampoline effect they have on impact. The comment period for the shaft limit ends March 4, while the deadline for comments on proposed test changes for golf balls and drivers is Aug. 2. In other words, any changes are still a long way off. The original plan was to publish a specific set of research topics related to distance last spring, but the USGA and R&A put that on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In the update Tuesday, they mentioned six ""areas of interest"" to explore, the first step in deciding whether to propose new rules. Research is likely to take the remainder of the year.                              - AP

183," The UK government authority selected NICE Advanced Process Automation for its proven capabilities, accuracy and scalability  Corporate Media Contact  Christopher Irwin-Dudek, +1 201 561 4442, ET, chris.irwin-dudek@nice.com  Investors  Marty Cohen, +1 551 256 5354, ET, ir@nice.com  Omri Arens, +972 3 763 0127, CET, ir@nice.com  NICE (Nasdaq: NICE) today announced that a key government agency in the United Kingdom chose NICE Advanced Process Automation technologies as part of its strategy to improve organizational efficiency and accuracy. In one of the most complex automation projects for which NICE advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics technology has ever been used, the agency is collecting and coordinating data from 19 different systems across the organization as part of its digital transformation strategy. In addition, the integration of NICE advanced AI and robotic automation makes it possible for the agency to annually streamline tens of millions of transactions, process more than 28 million pages of hand-written forms, and provide thousands of advisors with real-time guidance for interactions with the public.  Given the scope and scale of the authority’s activities, a growing population, periodically changing legislation and the need for resiliency in the face of crises, this department required an agile, highly scalable and flexible solution. The unique NICE combination of advanced AI and unattended automation was determined to be the best option for eliminating cumbersome, time-consuming tasks, boosting productivity and improving operations. Moreover, NICE’s technology is especially well-suited to the public sector where resiliency has become a non-negotiable.  Hundreds of NICE robots automate and support a wide array of processes across the agency, including administrative tasks, data gathering, communication with customers and regulatory compliance. For example, NICE technology is helping the authority process self-service applications for payment arrangements, update changes in circumstances in multiple systems, correct errors, coordinate diverse sources of data, and more. In addition, the NICE employee virtual attendant (NEVA) provides employees contextually relevant guidance during live interactions and assists with huge seasonal surges in frontline contacts. It can also quickly combine disparate systems and adjust processes on the fly to address rapidly changing needs.  In order to automate the processing of millions of pages of hand-written forms, the government agency implemented an integration of NICE automation solutions and the Hyperscience Platform, which delivers industry-leading intelligent document processing capabilities. The authority selected the Hyperscience-NICE joint solution after a “bake-off” pilot against major global competitors, during which it was found to be the most accurate and versatile. Across multiple types of forms with over 400 fields, the combined technologies demonstrated 99.4 percent reading accuracy -- which is above the 95 percent human accuracy level -- and 100 percent automation of data extraction and export.  “We are pleased to meet this important government agency’s need for a robust, innovative robotic process automation solution that saves time, improves productivity and provides greater flexibility,” said John O’Hara, President, NICE EMEA. “Leveraging our technology with the power of Hyperscience, this agency has seen a significant return on investment through efficiencies that free up resources, reduce complexities and streamline the organization’s multiple self-service options.”  NICE Advanced Process Automation solutions are increasingly becoming the technology of choice for public sector organizations embarking on a digital transformation journey as they mechanize their operations and uncomplicate repetitive tasks. For example, NEVA provides real-time, dynamic support, such as retrieving information the frontline agent needs, when they need it, and then assisting with any routine follow-up actions. Similarly, it can ensure that change of circumstances information received through multiple channels is automatically proliferated across relevant documentation. In addition to streamlining these processes, NICE automation solutions free employees to focus on the personal touch that is critical to ensure exceptional customer experiences.  About NICE  With NICE (Nasdaq: NICE), it’s never been easier for organizations of all sizes around the globe to create extraordinary customer experiences while meeting key business metrics. Featuring the world’s #1 cloud native customer experience platform, CXone, NICE is a worldwide leader in AI-powered self-service and agent-assisted CX software for the contact center – and beyond.

185,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, Aug. 5 -- Frederick Isasi, executive director of Families USA, has issued a public comment on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed rule entitled ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Updating Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations, and Improving Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond Proposed Rule"". The comment was written on July 28, 2021, and posted on July 29, 2021:* * *I am writing on behalf of Families USA, a national, non-partisan voice for health care consumers, dedicated to achieving high-quality, affordable health care and improved health for all, to provide comments on the Proposed Rule Updating Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations, and Improving Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond. We appreciate the opportunity to share feedback on the proposed rule, which proposes standards for issuers, Exchanges, and Navigators.The comments that follow are divided into three parts: first we provide feedback on the proposed payment parameters, largely supporting the Administration's proposed changes. Second, we comment on proposed modifications to 1332 waivers, sharing our deep concern that the Administration is proposing to maintain outdated statutory understandings that will close off progressive policy ideas for state Marketplaces.Finally, we lay out several critical areas for future CCIIO rulemaking.Our specific comments are below:I. Proposed Payment ParametersReinstatement of Navigator DutiesFamilies USA fully supports reinstating the policy (155.210) that allows navigators to help consumers navigate the health care system even after they have been successfully enrolled in coverage. This policy was withdrawn under Trump administration regulations. The policy previously included allowing navigators to address consumer issues that arise in the marketplace concerning exchange eligibility and appeals, use of coverage, and premium tax credits. In 2015, when previous rules and funding allowed for post-enrollment assistance, 79% of navigators and enrollment assisters reported that they helped with post-enrollment issues./1Post-enrollment assistance can entail helping consumers read and understand notices, gathering relevant documents, finding appropriate providers and scheduling initial appointments, understanding bills and cost-sharing requirements, reporting changes relevant to the marketplace, and placing a series of calls to relevant plan, provider, or marketplace personnel to clarify and resolve an issue. Navigators have performed these duties successfully in past years.If CMS does restore the post-enrollment function, CMS should increase grants to navigators in year-2 when navigators will again take on post enrollment duties.Community-based navigators, who have an in-person presence in the communities they serve, and established relationships with enrollees, can be particularly helpful in providing post-enrollment assistance./2CMS should reinstate requirements that there be at least one community-based nonprofit navigator in each state and service area, and that navigators have a duty to help all applicants, including through the process of application completion.Removal of the Exchange Direct Enrollment OptionWe wholeheartedly support removal of the Exchange Direct Enrollment option (155.221(j)). Exchanges provide a valuable function as a place to view comprehensive health insurance that meets federal standards, obtain advance premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions, and as a pathway to Medicaid and CHIP for those that are eligible for those benefits. As we commented previously, enhanced direct enrollment would have confused consumers, leading them to use entities that did not display all available plans and that may not have provided ""no wrong door"" seamless applications to Medicaid and CHIP. We agree that implementing direct enrollment at this time would have added complexity to marketplaces and detracted from implementation of the American Rescue Plan and future reforms.Lengthening Open Enrollment Period (OEP) through at least January 31, 2022.As proposed (155.410(e)), we support lengthening the open enrollment period. As noted, this will give consumers time to change plans if they find that their premiums have changed in the new year. However, we recommend lengthening that period to the end of January, giving people more time to schedule appointments with navigators and enrollment assisters after the holidays, and ensuring that people have time to see and understand notices about their new premiums. California legislation (AB 1309) permanently extended its marketplace enrollment period through January 31 beginning in 2020, one of several measures that led to increased enrollment. California plans were still able to effectuate enrollment for February 1. In 2021, many other state based marketplaces kept enrollment open beyond January 15 as well as providing additional special enrollment periods during the pandemic./3An additional reason to extend open enrollment until at least January 31st relates to people losing Medicaid and CHIP eligibility. In 2022, we anticipate that a number of people who had been on Medicaid will need to move to marketplace coverage as the Medicaid emergency Maintenance of Effort ends. Though they will be eligible for a special enrollment period (SEP), we urge CMS to keep the enrollment process as simple as possible, minimize documentation requirements, and afford them every opportunity to enroll in marketplace coverage. Maintaining open enrollment in the marketplace through at least the end of January will facilitate that transition.Changing Default Renewal RegulationsWe urge the Department to revise regulations governing renewal of marketplace enrollees' coverage during the OEP. Currently, if a consumer does not affirmatively select a plan, the consumer's former plan selection remains in effect, even if alternative plan options have changed substantially. A better structure would allow for limited auto-renewal into highly similar but lower-cost plans. If the current auto-renewal policy applies during the coming OEP, numerous low-income consumers are likely to suffer harm.A recent analysis by Anderson, Rasmussen, and Drake/4 found that 5.8% of California's marketplace enrollees whose coverage stands to be passively renewed would find themselves paying approximately $100 extra per month in premiums for a plan with deductibles $2,000 higher than what they would have received if the marketplace default was to move them to lower-costing plans. Nearly all (more than 98%) of affected consumers have low household incomes.Instead of the current default which keeps consumers enrolled in their current plan, the ""smart"" default renewal rule urged by Anderson and colleagues provides a process to assess whether there is a highly similar but better plan available and moves consumers only between plans with the same insurer, product design, and provider network. Consumers are shifted only when the new plan is at a more generous metal level (counting CSR silver-tier variants as comprising distinct metal levels, with 87%-AV and 94%-AV variants classified as more generous than gold) and the net premium is equal to or less than the premium charged by the former plan. Such a rule could be implemented based on several facts known to the marketplace:/5* Each plan's 5-character HIOS ID, which identifies the insurance company;* Provider network ID;* Plan Type (HMO, PPO, EPO, POS);* Metal Level; and* The consumer's APTC amount.The vast majority of consumers changing coverage would move from bronze or gold plans to 87%-AV or 94%-AV silver plans, while saving money on premiums (or spending no more on premiums).We urge HHS to require this policy for all Marketplaces for the coming open enrollment period. It will be the first OEP in which American Rescue Plan APTC enhancements will be available. Selecting plans is difficult and people will often let their previous plan choices remain in effect even though plan choices will change dramatically, due if nothing else to increased APTCs. The adoption of the smart default option would ensure that people don't automatically continue in a plan that is clearly not the best choice.To be clear - this is a default option that would go into effect only if the consumer made no other choice.Both before and after that option is implemented, consumers should be given notice and an opportunity to reject the change and stay with their current plan.Operationally, with some Marketplaces, it may be easier to implement such ""smart"" defaults if insurers rather than Marketplaces make those transfers. Such private-sector changes would need to be accompanied by the same opt-out chances and notice requirements that would otherwise apply to Marketplace actions.Monthly special enrollment period (SEP) for people with incomes up to 150% of povertyWe support this (155.420(d)) proposal that CMS provide a recurring monthly enrollment opportunity for marketplace coverage for people with incomes up to 150% FPL. This policy change promotes enrollment and access to health care among an income group with high uninsurance rates, many of whom qualify for no cost health insurance through the marketplace. States such as Massachusetts, Minnesota, and New York have been able to achieve high enrollment rates for low-income residents, without signs of significant adverse selection, by maintaining year-round enrollment opportunities./6At low- and middle-income levels, families face the highest rates of job losses, even before the pandemic./7These families fluctuate between Medicaid eligibility, marketplace eligibility, and job-based coverage. Small changes in hours of work and wages can alter program eligibility and disrupt family budgets. Further, when the public health emergency ends, some households that received Medicaid under FFCRA's Maintenance of Effort provisions will need to instead move to marketplace coverage, a process that may require outreach, time, and assistance. We support giving such households every possible opportunity to enroll in coverage.ParityWe support this (156.115(a)(3)) technical amendment that would clarify requirements to comply with the Mental Health Parity Addiction Act, including any amendments made to that law.Repeal of separate billing regulation for abortion coverageWe fully support the proposal to repeal the separate billing regulation at 156.280(e)(2) and to codify QHP issuer flexibility to select a method of segregation of funds that meets requirements in 1303 of the ACA.Repealing the separate billing regulation is consistent with Congressional intent: In enacting the ACA, Congress segregated coverage for abortion services from other health care coverage and maintained Hyde Act provisions that federal funds not pay for abortion, but retained the availability of abortion as a potentially covered service and allowed states to require abortion coverage. The Senate refused to adopt the Stupak-Pitts Amendment, which would have banned coverage of abortion in the exchanges, as well as barring federal subsidies for any QHP that covered abortion in cases other than rape, incest, or risk to the pregnant individual's life./8Likewise, the Senate rejected the Nelson-Hatch amendment that had a similar goal to ban coverage of abortion services in the marketplaces./9The separate billing regulation - which were halted by multiple federal court challenges but would have required QHPs to send consumers separate bills for coverage of abortion serves and for coverage of other services - runs counter to this framework. It would be costly to administer./10The complexity of paying two separate bills would cause confusion for consumers, and likely cause many to lose coverage for abortions.User fee recommendationWe support the proposal to increase marketplace user fees. User fees should be adequate to support key functions of the exchange, including upgrades to healthcare.gov, robust outreach, navigator grants (including sufficient funding to provide post-enrollment assistance and an in-person presence), creation and maintenance of a navigator portal that allows navigators to see the status of an applicant they are assisting, and funding to improve call center functions. We support increasing user fees to cover these functions.However, we (and other commenters) do not have enough information to comment on what amount of user fees would adequately support these functions because the expenditure of marketplace user fees has been too opaque. We request more transparency in the future regarding how revenues from marketplace user fees are administered, including how they are spent, what fees (if any) remain unspent, and major expenditure needs and plans in the coming year to, for example, upgrade technology, enhance navigator grants, or improve the call center.II. Modification of 1332 Waiver for State InnovationFiscal constraints preventing innovations that cover the uninsuredWe urge a revision to the Department's interpretation of the federal deficit neutrality guardrail.Maintaining the current interpretation will preclude state innovation that has the potential to increase enrollment among people who qualify for financial assistance, since enrollment increases typically raise aggregate federal spending. The ACA's core policy objective is reducing the number of uninsured. The Department's interpretation of state innovation waivers means that such waivers are effectively forbidden when they promise to better achieve that core policy objective. A longstanding canon of statutory interpretation--including recent judicial rulings on Medicaid waivers--is that a law should be interpreted to promote rather than undermine the accomplishment of its core objectives.In other contexts, federal officials have construed waiver authority to permit increased enrollment of eligible people. For example, Medicaid waivers under section 1115 of the Social Security Act have long been subject to an administratively-imposed requirement of federal budget neutrality. Beginning with then President Clinton's grant of a Medicaid 1115 waiver to permit the State of Tennessee to cover otherwise ineligible poor adults, CMS has permitted states to juxtapose waiver spending against baselines reflecting state implementation of alternative policies permitted without any waiver. A fixed quantity of federal dollars shifts from a policy the state could have implemented under the statute and instead is used to support the waiver. Federal budget neutrality is preserved under the waiver, relative to a baseline consisting of what the state could have done without a waiver. CMS has in recent years granted multiple Medicaid waivers with budget neutrality calculations referencing the 1902(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XX) state option to cover up to a state's entire non-elderly adult population under Medicaid. More generally, CMS has options to allow states to adopt progressive policy that clearly promotes statutory objectives. By maintaining the strict budget neutrality interpretation, the proposed rule makes it impossible for states to test innovations that have the potential to improve coverage for the uninsured. We now know that a growing list of states have good ideas for section 1332 waivers, and we also know that the Trump administration was ready to ignore both the 2015 guidance and the ACA's statutory language when it came to section 1332. We did not know either of these things in 2015. A narrow construction of section 1332 deficit neutrality requirements is an unnecessarily constricted legal reading deriving from a defensive political calculus from 2015 that was subsequently discredited on its own terms.Comprehensiveness of coverageWe agree with the proposed changes in 31 CFR 33.108(F)(3)(IV)(A) AND 45 CFR 155.1308(F)(3)(IV)(A)) that would use essential health benefits and Medicaid coverage as a standard of comparison for comprehensiveness. The statute specifically requires that coverage under a waiver ""be at least as comprehensive as the coverage defined in section 1302(b) and offered through Exchanges...."" We understand that to mean that while the precise benefits under a waiver may differ from the essential health benefits benchmark, the overall package must be at least equally comprehensive. We agree that the regulations should echo the statutory language regarding coverage that is actually ""provided"" under the waiver, not just coverage that is available.We also agree with guidance provided in the preamble that waiver proposals should consider the effect on comprehensiveness of coverage for residents of the state overall as well as on vulnerable populations.AffordabilityWe agree with the proposed changes in (31 CFR 33.108(F)(3)(IV)(B) AND 45 CFR 155.1308(F)(3)(IV)(B)) that would require coverage and cost sharing protections against excessive out-of-pocket spending that are at least as affordable as the provisions of Title I of the ACA.The preamble notes that the three Departments with jurisdiction will evaluate whether people have large health care spending burdens relative to their incomes, and will examine the effects on various vulnerable groups, but the proposed regulation does not pick up this language. Since the statute includes increased assistance for people with modest incomes, we believe that the regulations should similarly require examination of the effect of a proposed waiver on the groups now eligible for the largest premium credits and cost sharing reductions.Scope of coverage requirementThe proposed language at 31 CFR 33.108(F)(3)(IV)(C) AND 45 CFR 155.1308(F)(3)(IV)(C)) requires the Secretaries of the Departments with jurisdiction to determine that the State plan will provide coverage to a comparable number of state residents under the waiver as would have coverage absent the waiver. This section should be clarified to indicate that the coverage it references is comprehensive coverage, meeting the standards set forth in (A): the waiver should provide comprehensive coverage to at least a comparable number of state residents.Modification of Normal Waiver Proposal Notice and Comment Period in EmergenciesWe have concerns about the latitude that the proposed modification would provide under a vaguely defined ""emergency.""We agree that the 1332 waiver process should be expedited in cases of natural disaster, public health emergency, or other sudden emergency threats to human lives - similar to authority that states have used well for people who rely on Medicaid under 1115 waivers. However, the proposed 1332 regulation refers also to ""other emergent situations that threaten consumers' access to health insurance coverage, [and/or] consumers' access to health care."" We are concerned about the vagueness of this section, particularly because it does not define ""health insurance coverage"" to be comprehensive and is thus subject to misuse.The Medicaid 1115 emergency process includes more constraints. It applies only in cases of natural disaster, public health emergency, or other sudden emergency threats to human lives. The state must show that it acted in good faith, and in a diligent, timely, and prudent manner; the circumstances constitute an emergency and could not have been reasonably foreseen; and delay would undermine or compromise the purpose of the demonstration and be contrary to the interests of beneficiaries. We recommend that the emergency 1332 process include similar language.We support the procedural requirement that states detail any justification for seeking emergency authority, and detail alternative meaningful public input processes.Monitoring and complianceOur earlier recommendation that ACA Section 1332 be construed to permit innovations that increase the number of people receiving health coverage has implications for the proposed regulation defining federal pass-through payments (31 CFR 33.120 & 45 CFR 155.1320). As noted above, states should receive the same flexibility under Section 1332 to define the baseline against which waiver spending is compared that states have long received with Medicaid waivers under Social Security Act Section 1115. In addition to determining the application of the federal deficit neutrality guardrail, this same approach needs to shape the calculation of federal pass-through payments. If the state's alternative baseline scenario would take advantage of statutory options to raise the amount of federal financial assistance for which an individual qualifies, that amount should be used to define federal pass-through payments under the waiver.Waiver amendmentsWe support the proposed regulations at 31 CFR 33.130 and 45 CFR 155.1330 that delineate the process by which a state is permitted to submit an amendment to an approved section 1332 waiver, including a public comment process.III. Issues for future rulemakingStandardized PlansPursuant to the ruling in the Columbus v Cochran,/i CMS will require carriers to issue standardized plans in the future. CMS notes in the preamble that the timeline for plan and rate submission does not make it practical to do this for 2022. We request that CMS move expeditiously to put standardized plans into place for 2023. These plans should:- Require pre-deductible coverage of some services, and provide for copayments instead of coinsurance.Deductibles pose a barrier to needed care and exacerbate health disparities./11Standardized plans should make it easier for consumers to afford and understand the likely costs for health care;- Enable consumers to easily compare plans that all offer services at the same costs, based on differences in their provider networks, quality measures, and premiums;- Be easy to identify on the healthcare.gov website.CCIIO should examine state-based marketplace experience in determining its own standard plan designs.For instance, a quick review of these designs shows the following designs: California offers only standard plans, facilitating comparisons and quality shopping. Connecticut offers plans with no deductible for office visits, mammography, speech/physical/occupational therapy, diabetes equipment and supplies, and home health, and its plans provide a separate low deductible for drugs. Additionally, pediatric dental care is an embedded benefit and plans provide children's preventive dental care at no cost. In the District of Columbia, at the silver level, office visits, lab tests, generic drugs, urgent care, prenatal care, outpatient recovery services such as PT/OT, and child eye and dental services are pre-deductible. Massachusetts offers plans at the silver level that provide pre-deductible coverage for tier 1 and 2 drugs, outpatient visits, urgent care, and rehabilitation services. New York provides two sets of standardized plans, one that sets a deductible amount but requires the deductible to be met for most services, and another option in which three PCP visits are pre-deductible. (Basic Health provides low cost-sharing to modest income New Yorkers.) In Washington, the following services are not subject to silver deductibles: primary, specialty, and urgent care including outpatient behavioral health, therapies, labs and x-rays, generic and preferred drugs, ambulance services, eye exams for children./iiCMS should adopt standard plan designs that move broad segments of preventive and outpatient care such as these to be pre-deductible.Network AdequacyThe Department indicates its intent to issue rules regarding network adequacy for the 2023 plan year and requests comments as to how it should approach network adequacy reviews. We formally submit the attached letter, which we have shared with this administration previously. To summarize, the Department should:- Review the accuracy of provider directories, and make directories searchable by specialty, provider type, provider name and NPI,/12 languages spoken, and physical accessibility;- Monitor appointment wait times;- Monitor time and distance to travel to providers;- Establish a network breadth indicator on healthcare.gov;- Review out-of-network claims and denials, especially when the number of claims or denials creates a red flag; and- Establish metrics appropriate for mental health and substance use services for each type of setting and level of care.Attributing new coverage premiums to past due premiumsThe Departments indicate that they are considering whether the 2017 rule, allowing insurers to attribute premium payments intended for new coverage instead to past due premiums, creates an unnecessary barrier to coverage and should change for 2023 (147.104).We urge the Departments to change this rule beginning in 2022. The current policy specifically targets people who are struggling to pay monthly expenses, exacerbating health inequities. Health insurers should use other methods to pursue unpaid debts. We anticipate that consumers who have lost income during the pandemic, including those who did not learn how to access enhanced APTC, may have unpaid premiums as 2021 concludes. In some jurisdictions, laws or orders have required insurers to keep consumers' coverage intact during the public health emergency./13As the emergency ends and people return to work, consumers will need time to catch up on past due expenses and will need continued access to health coverage and care meanwhile.Thank you for considering these comments.

193,"
On Jan. 19, as President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris memorialized the 400,000 Americans who had died from COVID-19, I found tears streaming down my face. I hadn't realized how many emotions I'd been holding in, or how badly I needed a sign that it was okay to let go for a moment.
""To heal, we must remember,"" Biden said, standing beside the waters at the Lincoln Memorial. ""And it's hard, sometimes, to remember.""
Like many around the world, I've experienced the pandemic as a pervasive, slow-moving trauma that has left me separated from my full range of emotions. We live in fear of getting sick and dying, or of loved ones meeting a similar fate. Worldwide, 2.2 million people have died from COVID-19, leaving loss and grief in their wake. Many more have experienced frightening COVID-19 symptoms, or have lost jobs, homes and businesses because of the pandemic's economic effects. Our sense of safety has been shaken, or even shattered.
""The whole country is in a state of numbness and denial because it is all too much to take in. It is too much to process,"" Dr. Diane E. Meier, longtime director of the Center to Advance Palliative Care, part of New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital, told the New York Times in March.
But in the coming months, as more of us become fully vaccinated and are able to reconnect with others and return to school and work, all of those pent-up emotions are likely to come flooding out. We should get ready for that, and make space to let it happen.
Trauma expert Peter Levine writes about how, in response to trauma, our bodies (like animals' bodies) undergo a series of unconscious changes that make us more able to weather a threat. We may fight, flee, or freeze; think of an opossum or mouse ""playing dead."" When we're in danger, our emotions get turned off, because they would only slow us down. Only when the threat has passed do we have the opportunity to return to baseline and become able to feel and process what happened.
I've spent much of the past year vacillating between survival states. I've been grumpy and defensive; that's the fight response. I've buried myself in sewing and writing projects, keeping myself too busy to soften into my emotions; that's the flight response. And I've spent countless hours distracting myself with books, or bingeing TV and movies; that's the freeze response. It has often felt like there's a thick wall of glass between myself and my feelings. And I know I'm not alone.
For the first several months of the pandemic, my friend Daphne (not her real name) juggled fulltime work at a major tech company, plus full-time parenting, while her husband started a new full-time job. She tried to cope by putting one foot in front of the other, not allowing herself to feel anything.
In August, during an online appointment, her doctor asked how she was doing. ""I started crying and I couldn't stop,"" she says. Her doctor prescribed antidepressants, anti-anxiety meds and a medical leave from work. Although Daphne felt much better, she still didn't feel very much.
Particularly in the United States, we were rarely given a moment to rest, take stock, and grieve what we may have lost. Stimulus funds from the U.S. government came nowhere close to covering the cost of lost paychecks or missed rent and mortgage payments. The hustle didn't stop; it intensified.
The Trump administration didn't offer any moments of silence or ceremonies honoring those who'd died of COVID-19. We didn't get any public memorials until the one Biden and Harris held the day before their inauguration. Biden led another one a month later, when U.S. deaths crossed the 500,000 threshold.
For many who've lost loved ones during the pandemic, either because of COVID-19 or something else, their grief has felt muffled by isolation and by funeral services carried out on the screen, instead of in person. When my friend Zachary Graham's father lost his best friend - who was like a father figure to Graham - not being able to be with his dad in person was painful, he said.
""His pastor did a good job honoring him, but sitting there, crying in my kitchen, gave me very little closure,"" Graham said. ""I'm still trying to figure out a way to celebrate his love and grieve properly.""
Right now, millions of people in the U.S. are being vaccinated daily, which brings us closer and closer to feeling safe again. In the coming weeks and months, our bodies, our emotions, are likely to soften. A trickle or a flood of feelings - grief, terror, sadness - may come.
When Daphne got her first dose of COVID-19 vaccine in midMarch, a wave of emotion - and relief - flooded through her body. The 48-year-old Californian has multiple health conditions that put her at higher risk of severe or fatal COVID, and she has spent the pandemic isolated at home with her husband and 4-year-old son.
""I feel like crying. I feel like cartwheeling,"" Daphne said after the vaccination. ""For a year, I couldn't stop thinking about my son growing up without me. I've written him the letter every parent thinks about - the 'here's all the things I want you to know about life and I'm sorry I'm not there to tell you in person' letter.""
After trauma, whether it's a brief event or a year-long pandemic, one of the best ways for us to feel safe again is to be among other people. Humans are, by nature, a social species. Isolation, even without a pandemic at its back, is traumatic, according to Stephen Porges, director of the Trauma Research Center within the Kinsey Institute. Being with others, particularly others who are also feeling safe, and being able to look into each other's eyes, hear each other's friendly voices, and touch each other, is powerful medicine, Porges writes in his ""Pocket Guide to Polyvagal Theory.""
""As we build a new sense of safety, it's almost certain that we'll fall apart more times than we can imagine,"" mental-health coach Sam Dylan Finch wrote on Instagram in February. He was talking about trauma recovery in general, but it applies here, too. ""If you're breaking down, that doesn't mean you're doing recovery 'wrong.' In fact, we often break down only when we finally feel safe enough to do so.""
I got my first COVID-19 shot in mid-March. I was hoping for some sense of relief, but it didn't come. Friends of mine have contracted the coronavirus after their first shot, and a family member was hospitalized with it following his initial vaccination. It still doesn't feel safe, and probably won't until my second vaccine takes effect - until I'm able to see my family and friends again, wrap my arms around them, and see their faces, no longer obscured by masks.
I'm grateful that this year has made trauma and mental health a mainstream conversation, but a year is a long, long time to feel numb and alone. I wouldn't say I'm looking forward to the emotional deluge that's on the horizon, but I'm making space, getting ready. To remember, and to heal.

197,"Publication: The Circle, , Marist College, Poughkeepsie, NYIf you were on TikTok at all during the month of August, your feed was most likely infiltrated by “Alabama Rush TikTok.” The investment into what sorority these college girls would end up joining spread across the world, to the point where many of the individuals invested in “rush week,” are not even of college-age.
This year, The University of Alabama had over 2,500 students rushing for a chance to receive a bid from their favorite sorority. Many of these girls or PNM’s, potential new members, made the hashtag #BamaRush viral on TikTok after showing the outfits that they planned to wear for different recruitment days during the rush week. Outfits would range from panhellenic t-shirts and Lululemon skirts on philanthropy days to formal cocktail dresses on sisterhood days.
For many, it is captivating to see how much effort and attention these girls put in to impress the sorority sisters at the different houses, specifically schools in the North East that do not have the same Greek life culture. Watching these girls have the opportunity to rush sororities in person once again can be exciting to see as COVID-19 restrictions forced the nation to hold recruitment virtually this past year.
However, underneath the Kendra Scott jewelry and sorority girl-worthy clothing from The Pants store, is the negative history behind Alabama Greek life. One popular Alabama rush story that cracked open this shell had to do with TikTok user @whatwouldjimmybuffetdo, also known as Makayla, who was dropped from every sorority she rushed.
Makayla quickly garnered a multitude of fans, especially after it was revealed that she was biracial; being one of the few women of color seen on the app rushing this year. Just like the other girls, she posted “outfit of the day” videos and rush week TikTok videos, until it was revealed that she was dropped due to a video that was dug up of her supposedly underage drinking. Even though Makayla came forward and stated that she was, in fact, not drinking, she was still dropped from every sorority, meaning she would receive no bids to join any of them.
While this may seem like an individual issue, Alabama Greek life has a notoriously racist past. According to NPR, it was not until 2013 that Alabama sororities were desegregated, meaning black students were unable to rush.
Alumni from many southern universities have stated that many top-tier sororities already know from the beginning what girls they are going to give a bid to, as well as who they want in based on “the look” they want for their sorority.
In one TikTok in particular, TikTok user Cedoni Francis stated, “The top houses know who they want before anyone walks in their doors, because these are the girls who people have gone to summer camp with, these are the girls that people have rode horses with their entire life, these are the girls you go to high school with. Elitism breeds elitism.”
While it is fun to see girls running down Sorority Row to their “new homes,” the toxicity of Greek life remains prevalent in rush culture.
TikTok is a platform that generates trends and stories like wildfire. Now, the stories that lay underneath the pearly, white mansions, are beginning to rise above the surface.

198,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minnesota, issued the following news:Governor Tim Walz announced that Minnesota has reached the goal set by President Biden and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to vaccinate 70% of the state's 18-and-older population by July 4.CDC data shows that 3,034,281 Minnesotans age 18 years and older have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Minnesota is only the second state in the Midwest to meet President Biden's goal, and it leads the Midwest in the percentage of the overall population fully vaccinated (52%).""This is a remarkable achievement, and a credit to every Minnesotan who has rolled up their sleeves to get their vaccine and protect themselves and their communities,"" said Governor Walz. ""Ahead of Independence Day weekend, we're celebrating getting 70% of Minnesota adults vaccinated and all the good news that brings for Minnesota. Because of COVID-19 vaccines, new cases and hospitalizations are down to some of their lowest levels of the pandemic. With nearly 6 million doses administered across our state, we are seeing firsthand that these vaccines work, and I encourage every Minnesotan who has not yet been vaccinated to get their shot as soon as they can.""The COVID-19 picture has improved dramatically as more Minnesotans have been vaccinated against the virus. The seven-day average for new COVID-19 cases in Minnesota is 84 per day and the test positivity rate is a record-low 1.2%. Cases are growing at their slowest rate of the pandemic, and there are fewer than 100 Minnesotans hospitalized with COVID-19 -- the lowest figure since April 2020. ICU admissions are at their lowest level since March 2020.""Getting to this milestone today was a true team effort,"" said Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan. ""I am thankful for each and every Minnesotan who contributed to this vaccination push: to our doctors, nurses, and others for vaccinating everyone looking for their shot; to our hospitals, clinics, and local public health agencies for working tirelessly to make vaccines available to all; to our community partners for stepping up to host vaccination events around the state; to everybody who helped schedule an appointment for a relative or drive a loved one to get their vaccine; and to the more than 3 million Minnesotans who got their vaccine and helped us reach this landmark. We are better off because of all of you.""Minnesota continues to make it easy for anyone who wants a shot to get one. Over the next two weeks, the state and its partners are hosting more than 80 community vaccination events. Walk-ins are accepted at all state COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program sites, including the two newest sites offering Johnson & Johnson to travelers and others at MSP International Airport. Minnesotans can always find vaccine locations close to them by using the Find Vaccine Locations map or by visiting vaccines.gov.""This is a day to celebrate our COVID-19 response efforts, but the hard work continues,"" said Governor Walz. ""We are still focused on getting as many shots in arms as possible and meeting Minnesotans where they are. We need even more people to be vaccinated if we are going to build the broad protection necessary to keep ourselves, our loved ones, and our communities safe from COVID-19 for the long-term. We hit President Biden's goal, but we are not stopping here.""How Minnesotans Can Get their Shot:* Walk in or make an appointment through the Vaccine Connector at one of the state's COVID-19 Community Vaccination Program locations: VaccineConnector.mn.gov.* Appointment hotline: 833-431-2053- Mon-Fri, 9 a.m. - 7 p.m. & Sat, 10 a.m. - 6 p.m.* Use the state's Vaccine Locator Map to find a vaccine provider near you: https://mn.gov/covid19/vaccine/find-vaccine/locations/index.jsp .* Check for vaccine appointments using the Vaccine Finder on https://www.vaccines.gov/ You can search for appointments by vaccine type (e.g., Pfizer).* Contact your primary health care provider or a local pharmacy.* Employers may also reach out with information about vaccination opportunitiesMSTRUCK-7530634 MSTRUCK",Minn.

GLASGOW, Scotland — Presidents and prime ministers have left town. Now the hard work starts, with diplomats hunkering down in a cavernous tent complex at the U.N. climate talks here for the next week and a half, trying to hammer out deals to cut planet-warming emissions.
More nations than ever are pledging to reduce emissions, move away from coal, eliminate deforestation and deliver money to help poor countries adapt. Environmental groups and poor nations are not as optimistic. They have seen promises come and go before.
Here are five take-aways from the early, frenetic days of the climate conference:
Holding a global conference in a pandemic is hard.

More than 39,000 people are registered for the summit. One problem: Capacity in the main venue is limited to 10,000 people because of COVID restrictions.
That has led to bottlenecks, long security lines and frustration, especially among civil society groups that were already angry that the U.N. had capped their presence inside the negotiating halls.
Everyone entering the venue, known as the “blue zone,” is asked to take a daily rapid coronavirus test. But for all the talk of strict controls, participants simply self-report their results. It is basically an honor system.
The United States ‘showed up.’

For nearly four years, the United States worked to undermine the progress of climate talks. Former President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the Paris climate agreement and vowed to burn more, not less, gas, oil and coal.
President Joe Biden arrived in Glasgow and flipped the script. He promised to show the world that the United States is “leading by the power of our example.”
Asked about the leaders of other countries, particularly those of China and Russia, who did not attend, Biden said, “We showed up.”
But some pivotal leaders didn’t.

The absences of Presidents Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil were notable.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia did show up — but with an emissions target that experts said falls far short of what is needed. Brazil pledged to end deforestation by 2028. Activists are skeptical that Bolsonaro will follow through.
Both Russia and China have targets that, experts say, are not enough to keep the planet on a relatively safe trajectory. Leaving Glasgow, Biden scolded Xi and Putin for not attending. Officials in Beijing hit back, noting Biden was unable to persuade his own party to vote for climate legislation necessary to meet the United States’ aggressive targets.
Sparring will not solve the climate crisis. And it remains unclear whether the two biggest emitters, China and the United States, can move past tensions over trade and human rights to work together.
Money was pledged, but will it flow?

Banks and other lenders said they had $130 trillion to finance projects that aim to get companies and countries to net-zero emissions. The number, more than five times the size of the U.S. economy, grabbed headlines.
Environmentalists quickly threw cold water on it, arguing that scant details were provided and that banks still invest hundreds of billions of dollars in fossil fuels each year.
The next target: Ending coal

Poland, Vietnam, Egypt, Chile and Morocco are among 18 countries that will pledge Thursday to phase out coal-fired generation and stop building new plants. The British hosts of the U.N. conference want to leave their mark by ensuring the end of coal “is in sight.”
Yet the issue is deeply contentious. At the start of the summit, the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, told Morrison of Australia that “coal has no place in this century.” Morrison has clearly said he will not discuss fossil fuel mandates or bans.
Expect more pushback in the coming days from Australia, as well as China, India and Russia, to any language formalizing a phaseout of coal in any final decision from the summit.

",5 Takeaways From the First Days of the Climate Summit
201,"The Naples Winter Wine Festival is this weekend.  The 2022 festival, under the theme ""Twenty Twenty Twogether,"" runs Friday through Sunday.  The 22nd annual event marks a return to an in-person format after it pivoted to a virtual presentation last year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fundraiser, since its 2001 inception, has raised nearly $220 million for the Naples Children & Education Foundation.  This year's festival features 44 auction lots including a trip to the 2022 Kentucky Derby, a journey through Croatia and a 16-day trip across the Mediterranean.
The foundation's vice-chair and founding trustee, Valerie Boyd, has watched the festival evolve through the decades around one central tenet: a promise to help children.
""What is incredibly amazing to me is the generosity of the new trustees over the years who came into the Naples Winter Wine Festival, the Naples Children & Education Foundation, with the same commitment, their heart power, their soul power, their brainpower, to keep that promise,"" Boyd said.

Foundation CEO Maria Jimenez-Lara said in a December interview her team was monitoring all state and local health department guidelines and recommendations around COVID-19 and would comply with any rules and regulations in place at the time of the event.
""We're watching and making sure that we're monitoring all the information sources that we need to keep track of,"" she said.
According to Jimenez-Lara in January, safety protocols include a special air filtration system for the auction tent, a mask requirement for NCEF staff and volunteers, KN95 masks and hand sanitizer provided in patron bags and an outdoor viewing area with TV screens will be set up outside the tent for those who wish to step outside.
The NCH Healthcare System is also providing a germ-zapping robot to disinfect the tent before and after the auction.

202,"Dec. 29 - Chris Sarro spent Tuesday afternoon far from his roots in Ellsworth, but being near the beaches of Miami, Florida, wasn't all about rest and relaxation.
He was inside the city's historic 5th Street Gymnasium, training for his Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship cruiserweight bout against Quentin Henry scheduled for Jan. 29, 2022, in Jackson, Mississippi.
Sarro's sparring partner for the day? World Boxing Association heavyweight champion Trevor Bryan.
""I took some shots from the heavyweight champ that would have put the average pro down and I was surprised that with my conditioning now and how healthy I am that I took them,"" said the 33-year-old Sarro. ""Then I put some on him.""
One goal of Sarro's workout with the undefeated Bryan (21-0, 15 KOs) was to avoid being hit, because few Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship upper weight-class bouts go the distance.
Take Sarro, whose 2-2 record includes just one fight that lasted past the first round. Henry, at 3-1, has had a similar fate in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship cage, with just one bout going beyond the opening round.
""In [Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship] we can't take some [punches], we just have to give some so we have to be defensive,"" said Sarro, a former Northern New England Golden Gloves boxing champion. ""To get to that next level you have to be more disciplined. When I'm out there sparring I want to be smashing guys but I have to be working on defense and being slick and thinking because I can't take any shots from Quentin or anyone else where I'm cut or it's over. It's who gets who first.""
Sarro began his bare knuckle fighting career two years ago with first-round stoppages of John McAllister and Billy Martin but has dropped his last two bouts to Josh Burns in the second round and to Ehsanullah Kakar 46 seconds into the opening round of his most recent bout on April 30 in Birmingham, Alabama.
Sarro, who will fight Henry at 205 pounds, said he has adjusted his training regimen since then to focus more on sparring with the likes of Burns in Detroit and veteran kickboxer Warren Thompson in Atlanta than the running-oriented preparation he did in Puerto Rico before the Kakar fight.
He was supposed to fight on a Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship card in Montana in October but that got sidetracked when Sarro contracted COVID-19, then a scheduled December bout in Tampa, Florida, also fell through.
""I had already cut 25 pounds for that fight and I've kept the weight off since then and now I've had a full camp at 220 pounds,"" said Sarro, who struggled with a much larger weight cut before the Kakar bout. ""Coming into this fight I'm fresh.""
Henry's background comes primarily in the mixed martial arts cage where he compiled a 12-6 professional record between 2011 and 2018.
The West Monroe, Louisiana, product is 3-1 since joining Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship in August 2019 with two  first-round knockout victories preceding his lone loss by first-round knockout to former Ultimate Fighting Championship MMA standout Chris Leben.
Henry rebounded from that defeat by stopping Jason Fish in the second round of his most recent Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship bout on Aug. 20 at Biloxi, Mississippi.
Henry is ranked second in the Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship cruiserweight division while Sarro is eighth, and the winner could be in line for a title shot against recently crowned cruiserweight champion Lorenzo Hunt.
""Quentin's earned his spot,"" Sarro said. ""He's really tough, he's really aggressive but I'm a way better boxer and I'm training with world champs and that's the difference. He's really aggressive but I don't think he likes pressure.""
Henry and Sarro seemingly have been on a collision course for the last year and a half. When both fighters were coming off their initial Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship victories, Henry told his home parish newspaper, The Ouachita Citizen, in June 2020 that he looked forward to fighting the Mainer.
""He's a good friend of mine now, which is the weird part, but I'll be fine with that,"" Sarro said. ""He's been to all of my fights and I've been to all of his, so it's pretty close that way but I'm excited because once I go out there I flick the switch and it's on.""

203,"Three thoughts on the Utah Jazz’s 120-105 win over the Portland Trail Blazers from Salt Lake Tribune Jazz beat writer Andy Larsen.
1. Punishing small ball
By necessity, the Blazers played small on Wednesday, starting Larry Nance at center. That meant that they tried to switch 1-5 — but the Jazz just punished it over and over again, from the opening tip.
We should note that this is very different than the Clippers’ small-ball attack that worked so well in last year’s playoffs. For one, the Clippers small-ball lineup was actually pretty big: with Paul George, Marcus Morris, Reggie Jackson, Nic Batum, sometimes Kawhi Leonard, the Clippers could actually switch and not just get ran over.
But this? Anfernee Simons is too small to guard Hassan Whiteside.
Damian Lillard is too small to guard Bojan Bogdanovic.
So what is it that is translatable against better defenses, like those that the Jazz will see in the playoffs? Quick ball movement to get the ball down low to take advantage of the in-between moments.
Is this beautiful defense from Tony Snell? It’s not amazing, but, really, what does Batum do better? I’m not sure there’s a defender that’s realistically intercepting that pass from Ingles when it’s delivered that quickly, and while Gobert is holding him off. I think Gobert’s improved at that: he’s keeping his defender at bay, his body is balanced, and he understands the angles of when he has to turn to prevent Snell from getting where he wants to go.
The Jazz outscored the Blazers in the paint by a margin of 74-30. That’s gonna win you a lot of games.
Now, I don’t think destroying a shorthanded defense that, when it is actually healthy, ranks 28th in the league is enough to ensure playoff success. But I do think that the comfort level in how the Jazz did it was a good sign. It’s like the Jazz were playing a video game on the Rookie difficulty level — winning big doesn’t necessarily mean that the wins will come when the difficulty level moves to All-Star, but it’s good they dominated anyway.
2. Joe Ingles’ transition defense
I wrote about Ingles’ defense just two games ago. Writing on it again feels a little bit like beating a dead horse.
But man, it’s starting to get really glaring — and moving him to the starting lineup in Donovan Mitchell’s absence isn’t helping. There’s just no resistance at all to letting Simons past him here:
Now, at least he didn’t foul! And at least Rudy Gobert was leaving Reggie Perry, a guy you haven’t heard of before, open for three, not one of the Blazers’ more capable shooters. But the competition level is dreadful.
Statistically, the more jarring issue is in transition defense. The Jazz give up 19.6 more points per play when Ingles is in the game in transition, according to Cleaning The Glass. And it’s easy to see why: Ingles just does not try to defend when he’s playing transition defense.
He’s good at Eurofouling in transition to stop the break, and good at not fouling to give up and-ones, but... well, I think that’s a skill that essentially anyone can have. That’s essentially how I would play transition defense, and there’s a reason I’m a writer.
Look at this play: Ingles is actually in really good position here! He’s in the paint, outside of the restricted area, against a guy who is also 6-8 and has yet to score an NBA point this season. If he moves his feet, he has a decent chance, but instead does a miss of a double-handed swipe down for some reason?
This is after a missed free throw, believe it or not. I think he’s misidentified who he should be guarding on the play, but as a result, he’s scrambling to get back across the court — and then gives up. Gobert’s little “Huh?” reaction with his hands matched mine.
These moments are just really deflating. I’ll never forget this play in Game 5 against the Clippers last year, when Ingles just didn’t go after a loose ball in the playoffs.
Like, this is what happens as people age, right? They get slower and they care less. Ultimately, Ingles is still very useful: he can shoot, he can run pick-and-roll, and he can be a connector on offense, making plays like the one he made in point one. But there are moments on the other end of the floor when he’s holding them back from being as good as they could otherwise be.
3. Let’s talk Blazers
With 4:59 left and down 20 points, Damian Lillard got a tech, and immediately walked up to Blazers acting coach Scott Brooks and asked to leave the game.
He had a very good game: 32 points on 10-23 shooting. But ultimately, it wasn’t close to enough for a victory. And it’s fair to say that he’s frustrated by that; frustrated by his team’s 13-21 record, frustrated by their position of 12th in the NBA’s Western Conference.
The Blazers have been through a lot this season. Their GM was fired, partially due to harassment allegations. They got a new coach, who got COVID. They have five players in COVID protocols right now; C.J. McCollum has a collapsed lung for goodness sakes.
Even if they’re healthy, are they any good?
Eh, no. That they can’t defend anyone is the biggest issue. Lillard and McCollum are defensive liabilities. Robert Covington and Larry Nance are good at some things on defense but not all the things. Jusuf Nurkic wasn’t ever an amazing defensive center, but it appears injuries have sapped him of his ability to move well enough.
But honestly, their offense has been pretty boring as well. Teams know that Nance, RoCo, Snell and so forth aren’t really threats to beat them, so why not just crowd Lillard and make his life difficult?
It’s just a bummer of a situation, and one that’s hard to figure out what to do next. Improving around the fringes doesn’t feel like the right move: it’s not like they’re one role player away from contending. It’s a star-level reconfiguration they need.
The obvious move would be to trade McCollum, but he still has $100 million on his contract. A Ben Simmons/Lillard backcourt partnership might make some sense in the offense/defense sort of way, but Simmons’ lack of shooting doesn’t exactly give Lillard more space, but less of it.
Trading Lillard sucks. The guy honestly loves Portland, loves the idea of playing for one team for his whole career. His entire brand as a player is based on loyalty. And who could give up enough trade assets and picks to make a trade worth it? It’d have to be a good team to want Lillard, but that means those picks would be low first rounders. (And, no, I can’t even imagine a package for the Jazz that makes any sense at all for the Blazers that doesn’t involve Donovan Mitchell. Why would the Blazers want Bojan Bogdanovic and 2026 late firsts?)
Portland just deserves better. It’s a really passionate fanbase that the Blazers have, probably reminding me more of Jazz fans than any other team in the league. They show up, they get loud, they love their small-market franchise that’s the only big game in town. After visiting the town twice in the last couple of months, I think the downturn of Portland as a city has been greatly exaggerated — it’s still a great place to be.
But tonight’s atmosphere at the Moda Center was the deadest I’ve ever felt it... it made me sad, honestly.
They need a jolt. But I don’t know when, or how, they’re going to get it.",The Triple Team: Jazz outscore Blazers 74-30 in the paint to get another easy road victory
207,"The Coachella Valley Unified School District Board of Education on Thursday evening unanimously voted down the district's proposed transition plan to a hybrid-learning model that would have begun on April 19.
The plan would have gradually returned students to classrooms in small groupings before moving all students back to campus two days per week for the remainder of the school year.
The district's 20 schools and nearly 18,000 students have been operating in a distance-learning model since last March when officials ordered the shutdown of all schools within Riverside County to curb the spread of COVID-19.
Board member Jesus Gonzalez suggested denying the district's recommendation in order to, as he described it, ""do some more work with this, to see if that is a possibility.""
Board Vice President Silvia Paz agreed.
Despite its decision, the board said it will continue looking at other hybrid options that may be more universally acceptable.
Paz said she wanted it to be clear that the board's decision was not meant to ""put this to bed, but to explore how we could re-open. We just didn't like the proposal.""
""That's a good summary of my position...,"" Gonzalez added.
The board did, however, approve the second part of the proposed hybrid-learning model — the expansion of ""Power Up Hubs"" — an initiative aimed at digitally transforming the teaching and learning environment with enhanced online software that can be used by teachers and students to improve the distance-learning experience.
""Tonight the CVUSD school board voted down the proposed in-person hybrid model of instruction to our students, choosing to continue in a distance learning model for now,"" Coachella Valley Teachers Association said in a written statement to The Desert Sun. ""CVTA believes this was the right decision, especially considering around 75% of our parents want their children to remain in a distance learning model for the remainder of the year but also because it is so late in the year and would be so disruptive.""
The two other school districts in the Coachella Valley are pursuing different options in their efforts to return students to a sense of normalcy.
On March 15, students in the Desert Sands Unified School District began hybrid learning, while the Palm Springs Unified School District has opted to stagger its students' transition back into the classroom. Starting April 12, elementary school students will return to a form of in-person learning, followed a week later by middle school and high school students.
In December, CVUSD released results of a parent survey, which found that 75% of parents in the district did not want their children to return to campus in a hybrid model. They instead preferred to keep their children in a distance learning model for the remainder of the school year.
Regardless, the district has continued to work on a plan that will return students to campus.
Several parents and teachers challenged the plan and wrote to the school board to urge its members to vote against approving a transition to hybrid learning. That written communication was read aloud during Thursday's board meeting.
With seven weeks remaining in the current school year, parents pointed to the stress and anxiety their children would likely experience due to the change in schedules, class settings and teachers.
Teachers emphasized that they want to stay with the same students they've worked with the entire school year, which they believe would not be possible should the district begin a hybrid-learning model.
Others urged the board to take into account the health risks that a return to in-class learning might cause for students and teachers. They added that while the amount of new coronavirus cases may be declining due to the vaccine, many people are still unvaccinated and new, more contagious variants continue to be discovered.
""Please vote no on returning to our sites in a hybrid model,"" one teacher wrote, anonymously. ""Please vote no to throwing our seventh graders in a totally new experience that will undoubtedly be very chaotic.
""I teach seventh grade and according to what I hear, they do not want to share a new school with a new teacher at the end of a stressful year.""
On March 13, 2020, then-Riverside County Public Health Officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser ordered the closure of all county public schools, as well as preschools, charter schools, private schools and all colleges to prevent the further spread of the coronavirus.
As part of that closure, all high school sports were canceled and the athletics hiatus continued until March 2 when the county reported a case rate of 11.3 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents. Riverside County had dropped below the all-important number of 14, which was the magic number that would allow outdoor contact sports to resume.
High school football resumed March 19, and other sports also have resumed with limited attendance and continued restrictions, including masks, social distancing and required coronavirus testing.
CVUSD has, in recent weeks, discussed similar protocols and procedures that will be put in place before students, teachers and other faculty return to campus.
In a statement Thursday, CVTA addressed comments made during the March 25 board meeting that it says were intended to make CVTA the scapegoat in the pandemic, which kept students in distance learning longer than anticipated.
""It's safe to say that CVTA did not cause this pandemic, did not close schools down back in March of 2020, and that CVTA does not have control over the constantly changing guidance on school reopening,"" the statement read. ""The comments we heard during the meeting are divisive and completely deviate from the blended model teaching respect and inclusiveness which our school board regularly pushes as a priority in CVUSD.
""CVTA has a tentatively agreed Hybrid (memorandums of understanding) with CVUSD. CVTA negotiated this MOU for months in good faith under the assumption that the District team was doing the same. It was our belief that we were working collaboratively with the District to have an in-person program to offer our students when we were safely ready to do so. To hear our school board act as if the MOU was something the 'union' did on their own and that it isn't in the best interest of students is insulting, and only highlights the disconnect in CVUSD between administration and the school board. CVTA Members will vote on this MOU next week, and we are very curious to see what the school board will do when it comes time for them to approve the tentative agreement between CVTA and the CVUSD negotiations team. Bargaining in good faith is something CVTA takes very seriously, along with constant communication between the CVTA board and the negotiations team throughout the bargaining process.
""CVTA has always been prepared to return to classrooms when the board determined it was the right time to do so, and after listening to them say for months they didn't believe we should open, it is extremely confusing to hear them act as if they've been wanting to have students back and haven't been able to do so. In fact, our educators would love nothing more than to be safely back in classrooms with our students. We have to question, though, why tonight the board reversed many opinions they've stated publicly for months, but especially why they would try to make it seems as if CVTA was responsible for not offering in-person instruction to our students.
""CVUSD only this month started the 'Power Up Hubs' when they could have implemented them months ago, a point CVTA brought up more than once. We have to question why they didn't offer this in-person service to students much earlier. It seems as if our school board is either misinformed or simply doesn't have the same information the negotiation teams had when working on a Hybrid model that incorporates all the safety guidelines. Hearing the comments made at the CVUSD school board meeting tonight was more than disappointing and only points to what we believe may be internal issues which need to be handled, in the best interest of all parties involved.""
26 laptops donated to CVUSD students
A local couple is donating almost $10,000 to the CVUSD's high school Expanded Afterschool Learning Programs, which will fund 26 laptops for students.
The devices will go to students in the eastern Coachella Valley who have the highest need and/or are going on to vocational training or higher education, according to a news release issued Thursday.
School board member Adonis Galarza-Toledo and Riverside County Supervisor V. Manuel Perez's office helped coordinate the donation between the couple, who wishes to remain anonymous, and the school district.
""This gift will make an impact in helping our local students and contributing to their education and success,"" Perez said. ""This generous donation is inspiring and positive news.""
The CVUSD board approved the donation, in the amount of $9,881.24 Thursday. The devices will be distributed by May.
""In these challenging times,"" said Bea Gonzalez, coordinator for Expanded Learning Programs for CVUSD, ""it is amazing to see that someone took the time to acknowledge the continued need and disparities that many students face in the south east end of the Coachella Valley.""
""Through this pandemic, the digital divide became even more evident,"" Galarza-Toledo added. ""Owning a laptop and having Wi-Fi at home became no longer a luxury but rather a necessity to live. Thank you to the generous donors for this contribution, and to the 26 students who receive this gift: you now have the duty to make the best out of this and one day pay it forward.""",CVUSD rejects proposed move to hybrid learning

Bond said that parents often tell her they didn’t sign up to be teachers and physical education instructors for their kids. A common topic of conversation from parents is that “they need a break,” Bond said.
A study by the Minnesota Department of Education found that 64% of parents surveyed would be comfortable sending their children back to a classroom.
The readiness to send kids back to in-person learning, however, is short-sighted, given how unprepared we are to deal with pediatric COVID-19 healthcare.
Not only will it take at least a year for a vaccine for children to be ready, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a multisystem inflammatory disease in children (MIS-C) who are exposed to COVID-19.
Some teachers in LA County that advocated for the benefits of remote learning are all too eager to return to the classroom now that they have been added to the COVID-19 vaccination list, an option none of their students will have.
Regardless of the risks, Governor Newsom has decided to bow to the public pressure of parents and teachers and pass Assembly Bill-86, which provides $2 billion in incentives to eligible school districts that open TK-6 schools to in-person learning by April 1.
The bill puts unfair pressure on schools in counties where COVID-19 cases are lower than seven per 100,000 residents, making them choose between reopening schools to in-person learning or missing out on the $2 billion incentive.
“We’ve already been on edge for like a year, and then it’s like ’Oh, dangle a carrot,‘ and, ’You can only use this if you do this,'” Bond said. “So [school districts] are like, ’Tell me how‘ because they‘re barely making ends meet.”
Elementary school education and social interactions are a critical part of childhood development. If we are to make that work in a pandemic where pediatric care is an unknown variable, we are going to have to prioritize children’s health.
This means creating educational equity for every child at high risk for COVID-19 and MIS-C. A first step would be for state and local officials to pair teachers specialized in elementary-level remote-learning with parents and households of kids at high-risk.
Providing specialized and targeted aid to underprivileged homes of high-risk children would also help close the equity and technology gap. And finally, schools need to create a COVID-19 safety plan for kids going back to in-person learning.
Children are the future of humanity and we need to ensure that that future has the opportunity to be healthy and thrive.

210,"The U.S. Army Reserve Command issued the following news:For a career that started with the Massachusetts Army National Guard and involved five overseas combat tours since 1991, now totaling over 31 years of military service as a Civilian-Soldier, Maj. Gen. Richard F. Johnson achieved another milestone when he took command of First Army Division West.First Army Division West's ""Longhorns"" receive what several colleagues have observed to be an invaluable leader to one of the U.S. Army's oldest and highly respected organizations. When Johnson joined the Longhorn division to lead the mission as the first-ever Commanding General from the National Guard component in the normally Active Duty billet, Johnson brought his Guard perspective to the Total Force partnership mission, and ensuring a seamless transition of Active Duty, National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers to fulfill global force requirements.Johnson completed his duties and responsibilities as the Deputy Director of the National Guard Bureau (NGB) in Arlington, Va. He took command from Maj. Gen. Frank W. Tate on Dec. 14, 2020. Johnson and Tate worked together on assignments several years before while at the 101st Airborne Division. Now, Johnson is looking forward to continuously building new partnerships across the Total Army when it comes to Soldier readiness for global deployments, while keeping Soldiers safe from the COVID-19 pandemic.""It is wonderful to be here at Fort Hood, and while it's a pinnacle time for our nation's ongoing efforts for a full recovery from the COVID-19 virus, our mission at Division West remains no change,"" said Johnson during his first few days of command. ""It is a privilege to be First Army's Division West commander as we all continue to work together, further defining and expanding our main efforts as the division that can prepare and provide realistic training for all Army National Guard (compo 2) and U.S. Army Reserve (compo 3) units to meet a force readiness for any mission.""Division West comprises five brigades, along with supporting elements from the 85th U.S. Army Reserve Support Command (85th USAR SPT CMD), each with training battalions consisting of Soldiers designated as Observer, Coach, Trainers (OC/T) that directly carry out the mobilization and demobilization for assigned Soldiers arriving to their training grounds. 166th Aviation Brigade, alongside its neighbors from 120th Infantry Brigade local to Division West Headquarters, both manage extensive training requirements for units mobilizing at North Fort Hood, Texas. The 5th Armored Brigade conducts OC/T operations at Fort Bliss, Texas, while the 181st Infantry Brigade conducts its training support at Fort McCoy, Wis., and the 189th Combined Arms Training Brigade (CATB) at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, Wash.Other colleagues from Division West staff and brigades take notice of how Johnson brings a new perspective and direct approach to what Army National Guard and U.S. Army Reserve Soldiers go through once they are called up to Active Duty service for the nation's military engagements, whether the requirements are peacetime or wartime.""Having Maj. Gen. Johnson come in from the Pentagon and the National Guard side of the Army really allows us as a division, and for First Army, to get a fresh set of eyes on how we're doing current operations, working our training, and building partnerships with our mission out there,"" said Command Sergeant Major Kevin M. King, command sergeant major for Division West.""So, this really gives us the view all the way from the strategic level, and how that's impacting us at the tactical level with our training units out there. It's very refreshing to read into a different side of the story,"" King added.This is especially important, due to many aviation assets residing in the Guard and Reserve.""Our mission is to train all army aviators and technicians that come from all components when they are ordered to Active Duty. From this, we do everything we can to take care of all them the same way we take care of our own, so that they can focus on their upcoming mission on-hand,"" said Col. Jennifer A. Reynolds, commander of 166th Aviation Brigade, Division West, commenting from the aviators' perspective.""To the Army, aviation units are exceptionally high demand, but low-density assets. And with these units coming in from every state, where they are already spread out far and wide, that can create challenges on them coming together as a team,"" said Reynolds.Currently, the 40th Expeditionary Combat Aviation Brigade, composed of Soldiers from numerous National Guard aviation regiments from across the country, were undergoing their early phases of training by the 166th Aviation Brigade.""Fortunately, it is impressive seeing how so many leaders from each state are able to quickly identify and work with each other, resulting in a big difference when they leave together for their mission,"" she added. ""Maj. Gen. Johnson readily gets this, and because of the energy he brings to the job, to include his experience and genuine interest to making sure we get after the resources needed for these complex mission sets, it's only going to make us better at our job as an Active Duty unit.""While OC/Ts are currently assigned to numerous training missions at installations assigned to Longhorn division, there are only two that remain active with non-stop rotations of mobilization events, otherwise known as Mobilization Force Generation Installations (MFGIs). Fort Hood and Fort Bliss are these MFGIs that provide deploying units with the most intense training environments necessary for continuing missions in Europe and the Middle East.""There is no better timing for Maj. Gen. Johnson to lead our organization,"" says Col. Brian P. Wolford, commander of 120th Infantry Brigade, Division West. ""Whether it's Operation Atlantic Resolve or Inherent Resolve, we've got a mix of compo 2 and 3 units that are on a Title-10 deployment any given time throughout the year.""""From reassuring our allies or messaging our foes about the U.S. Army's capabilities, it's actually our Army National Guard and Army Reserve who are in the forefront of those efforts, and Maj. Gen. Johnson brings with him that credibility and legitimacy to serve responsibly over our continued partnerships to meet pre-mob and post-mob qualitative training,"" Wolford added.The terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, brought a renewed emphasis on the Total Force concept to fulfill deployment requirements, said Wolford.""Before 9/11, there really weren't many Guard and Reserve units activated for overseas duty,"" Wolford said. ""As the last 20 years have shown in our nation's wars and conflicts, 75 percent of the sustainment and support units were made up of both components. Without them, there would be no Army.""Wolford has embraced the Total Force concept within his own formation.""In addition to how Longhorn division works, it's really the same way I approach the 120th mission. I don't see a 'compo 1, 2, or 3' when working with our partners,"" said Wolford. ""Instead, I see a fellow American who is wearing a U.S. patch on their right sleeve in the same color uniform as me, who is going to a job that any given geographic, combatant commander needs them to do. So, it really doesn't matter who they are and where they come from, but it's really the professionalism and unique experiences they are bringing from their state communities to the fight, and I think Maj. Gen. Johnson will easily become the face of that for our division as well.""Soldiers of the 189th Combined Arms Training Brigade also reacted to the historic placement of a member of the National Guard as the commander of First Army Division West.""We are excited for the opportunity to serve under a commanding general from the National Guard, and value the perspective and unique experience he brings to the mission,"" said Sgt. 1st Class Efrain Gutierrez, an OC/T and Operations NCO for 3rd Battalion, 364th Brigade Engineer Battalion, 189th CATB. ""We look forward to fully understanding his vision and seeing the impacts it will have on the way we train our partnered units.""""Maj. Gen. Johnson's experience in civilian law enforcement, and as a business owner, could bring a new approach to modernization and personnel management,"" said Lt. Col. Gregory A. Jenemann, battalion commander of the 3rd Battalion, 358th Infantry Regiment, 189th CATB highlights, The Army has consulted and contracted with civilians for decades, but this puts our division commander with years of civilian experience in a position to lead change for the organization.""""A commander who is an experienced Guardsman will provide valuable insight into our partners' support requirements,"" said Lt. Col. Bowe T. Avril, battalion commander of the 2nd Battalion, 357th Infantry Regiment, 189th CATB. ""Our next challenge will be returning to optimal readiness as the country returns to the previously established norms of in-person work and internet-classroom schooling. There will be greater demands on our partner Reserves and Guardsmen's time, while we continue our high state of preparedness for contingencies and war. We will do this the same way we have met all other challenges and adapt to change; by knowing our Soldiers through intimate leadership, and shared dedication to the mission. Our responsibility is to ensure the Total Army is ready for any threat. We are excited to be led by a commander who personifies the professionalism of our organization.""""Our division commander is in a very unique situation to impact change where necessary for our compo 2 and 3 mobilizations, but also inspire all of our OC/Ts throughout the division to learn how to become masters of their craft,"" said Philip D. Calahan, deputy chief of staff for First Army Division West. 'Mass' is one of the nine principles of war, and will become a requirement for successful large-scale mobilizations when called upon. From well-done After Action Reviews to the fundamentals of marksmanship, OC/T's demonstrating these skills to Soldiers undergoing mobilization will allow them to achieve decisive results for tomorrow's conflicts.""Division West continues to carry a strong tradition of being the Active Duty component that specializes in producing readied multi-component army forces under the oldest and long-established First Army, a recognized corps unit under U.S. Army Forces Command, U.S. Army.MSTRUCK-7448155 MSTRUCK",National Guard General Takes Command of Division West
211,"On Sept. 11, 2001, Mark Desire was working on a Brooklyn homicide case when the planes crashed into the World Trade Center's twin towers. He was 33 years old and four years into his tenure with New York City's Office of Chief Medical Examiner.
Within minutes, he was on the scene at ground zero.
""Our mission was to preserve the evidence,"" Desire said. ""Our job was to set up a temporary morgue and command post and do our best — and not get killed by falling debris.""
He almost did. His four-man crew was working a stone's throw from the south tower when it collapsed.
""Luckily my team survived, but we were pretty banged up,"" Desire said. ""My left foot was shattered and I had a concussion.""
He reported for work the following day. His supervisor, noting his condition, gave him a job he could do sitting down.
""I got assigned to working with the families to make DNA identifications,"" Desire said.
Twenty years later, he's still doing it.
The High Bridge, Hunterdon County, resident, who also teaches criminal justice courses at Rutgers University, leads the team of forensic biologists identifying human remains found at ground zero. Of the 21,905 remains collected, one-third (7,155) haven't been matched with a specific person.
""I get asked all the time, 'In 20 years, you still haven't finished this?'"" Desire said. ""We have finished it. All those remains have been attempted. What we do is, we advance the technology and then attempt again.""
Now an assistant director at the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, Desire is last member of the original forensics team still plugging away. Some of his colleagues were in fifth grade when the towers fell.
""I'm very proud to work here,"" he said. ""That commitment 20 years later is as great as it was back in 2001. We're not going to quit. We don't stop.""
Learning from failure
On the morning of Sept, 12, 2001, Desire starting making 20,000 case files.
""That was the initial fatality number we were given,"" he said.
Over time the number whittled down to the final count: 2,753. Desire's team has identified remains of 1,647 of those victims. That leaves 1,106 victims (40%) without any remains identified.
""Very quicky we knew DNA was going to be the major ID modality,"" Desire said. ""There were very few people who were intact, where you could visually ID them. Dental records and fingerprints, there were very few (identifiable that way) because of the fragmentation.""
In some cases, Desire said, ""there were hundreds of pieces of one person, very small, the size of Tic-Tacs scattered throughout the blocks where the World Trade Center was.""
In other cases, he said, ""I tend to think there were victims where there's nothing to recover. They were basically cremated.""
DNA testing, which requires samples provided by the victim's family — from a used toothbrush or razor, for example — has accounted for roughly 90% of successful identifications. At this point, Desire said, his team makes about 100 identifications in a typical year, ""and almost all of them are going to be previous identifications, where the families already received something.""
He said the last positive ID for a previously unidentified victim took place in 2019. In 2020, COVID-related duties became a priority; all of Desire's team members have other forensics responsibilities. But an emerging DNA-testing method called ""next generation sequencing"" might unlock information from samples too degraded to be analyzed in the past.
""The technology today, if you asked me about it back in 2001, I would have said, 'That sounds like science fiction,'"" Desire said.
New York City's forensic biology department has its own research and development unit. Desire said advances they've made in the quest to identify ground zero remains have changed the entire field, solving cold cases from the 1960s and drug-cartel murders in Mexico.
""If something big and bad happens someplace in the world, New York City is going to get a call to help out, and we share what we know,"" Desire said. ""The World Trade Center work has pushed forensics into the future.""
As a professor, Desire said there's a lesson drawn from this ongoing task that he imparts on students.
""It's about never giving up,"" he said. ""I tell my students, you're never going to reach your potential if you don't fail. We've had 20 years of failure and we don't give up. Learn from your failures and use them.""
'Unheard of in forensic science'
Desire, who grew up in Gloucester Township and graduated Rutgers-Camden with a biology degree, was trained to keep emotion out of his work.
""That's the No. 1 rule,"" he said. ""You certainly don't meet the families of victims. That holds true, except for the World Trade Center.""
His team's relationships with families has been a key part of acquiring the necessary DNA samples.
""In our lab we'll have World Trade Center families come in and tour and meet scientists,"" Desire said. ""That's unheard of in forensic science.""
Desire's team is careful to abide by families' wishes. Some want to be notified every time remains from their loved one is identified. Others ask to be updated just once a year. Others don't want to be contacted at all; those remains are placed into a private repository at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum, which is located at ground zero.
The times when Desire does make that phone call, especially to a family who had no remains of the person they lost, the gravity of his work is inescapable.
""When you hold a piece of someone in your hand that you've just identified — it's taken 10 times of going back to it (with new technology) — and you're able to return that loved one to their family, they're crying, hugging you and thanking you for bringing their little boy home,"" he said. ""That's really powerful.""

215,"ALBANY — New York's ethics watchdog agency on Tuesday ordered former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to repay to the state the proceeds he received from his $5 million book deal last year to write about his response to COVID-19 pandemic.
The unprecedented move by the state Joint Commission on State Ethics comes a month after it rescinded its approval of his lucrative book deal after investigators found he flouted the terms of the agreement by using staff and state resources to help him craft it.
The board voted 12-1, a commission spokesman said, to authorize the state Attorney General's Office to seek the return of proceeds the disgraced former Democratic governor got from the book, which briefly made it onto the New York Times best seller list last fall.
The book was authored at the height of Cuomo's popularity as he held daily, nationally televised COVID briefings. But his star soon fell amid sexual harassment allegations against him by former aides and other women that led to his resignation last August.
Late last month, the Assembly Judiciary Committee released its own investigation into Cuomo's actions that found he used state resources and property to help write the book, which would be a violation of state law.
Public Officers Law violations can be punished by a fine of up to $10,000 and the value of any ""compensation or benefit received as a result of such violation.""
An attorney for Cuomo blasted JCOPE's bi-partisan vote.
""JCOPE's actions today are unconstitutional, exceed its own authority and appear to be driven by political interests rather than the facts and the law,"" the attorney, Jim McGuire, said in a statement.
""Should they seek to enforce this action, we'll see them in court.""
How much Cuomo would have to return is uncertain.
Cuomo's tax return in May showed Crown Publishing Group paid him $3.1 million in 2020, and he was due as much as $2.15 million this year.
Another complicating factor is what he already did with some of the money.
While Cuomo's net book income after taxes and expenses was about $1.5 million last year, he donated $500,000 to the United Way and put the remaining $1 million in a trust for his daughters, according to his office at the time.
Sen. Sue Serino, a Republican from Dutchess County, said in a statement: ""Every penny that the disgraced former governor profited off of New Yorkers' pain should be directed to the victims of his dangerous pandemic policies, like the many families who lost loved ones in New York's nursing homes.""

218,"Mar. 9The banking sector in Uzbekistan has remained stable throughout 2020, despite the destructive impact of COVID-19, Trend reports referring to International RAEX group (International group of rating agencies).
RAEX-Europe has confirmed the sovereign government credit ratings of Uzbekistan at 'BB-' (sufficient level of creditworthiness of the government) in national currency and at 'BB-' (sufficient level of creditworthiness of the government) in foreign currency.
The confirmation of Uzbekistan's ratings at 'BB-' with stable outlook reflects the acceptable level of public debt and decent economic performance amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
According to RAEX, despite the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, Uzbekistan is one of the few countries able to avoid economic contraction in 2020, showing a year-end GDP growth of 1.5 percent.
""With the rollout of the vaccination, relaxation of the lockdown measures and the pick-up of economic activity we expect the growth rate of the economy to come back to its pre-pandemic levels of 5-6 percent in the medium term. Our base case scenario can however be restricted by the introduction of new lockdown measures and the issues with the rollout of the vaccines,"" RAEX report said.
Also, RAEX expects that the unemployment rate in Uzbekistan will decrease to 13 percent in 2021 with the pick-up of economic activity in Uzbekistan and abroad and reach the levels of 9-10 percent in subsequent periods.
Although the budget revenues remained resilient in 2020, due to the urgent need to cushion the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic Uzbekistan had to increase spending on social sphere and medical care which has contributed to the widening of the overall fiscal deficit from 2 to 5.6 percent by the end of 2020.
RAEX said provided that the coronavirus pandemic will be kept under control and additional COVID-19 expenditures will not be required, it is expected the fiscal balance to return to its pre-pandemic levels in midterm perspective.
In addition, the banking sector in Uzbekistan has remained stable throughout 2020, despite the destructive impact of COVID-19.
""We note the timeliness of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) precautionary measures to ensure financial stability and to maintain adequate liquidity of commercial banks. The regulator makes use of REPO (repurchase agreement) and swap operations  it has reduced reserve requirements and introduced a special credit line to provide liquidity to banks for up to three years.""
The CBU has implemented a set of measures in order to support the economy during the pandemic which included postponement of repayment of loans to the population and businesses, maintaining the liquidity of the banking system and ensuring the stability of the payment system.
""Given the impact of the pandemic on the macroeconomic situation and the dynamic of the inflation the CBU reduced the key rate to 15 percent in April 2020, and further to 14 percent in September 2020.  Follow the author on Twitter: @romakayeva

219,"The Democratic sweep of Georgia's Senate seats has ushered in a heady new reality for President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office in two weeks with a mandate to act and the numbers on Capitol Hill to deliver on some of his most ambitious promises.
Freed from the constraints that soon-to-be Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was poised to place on his agenda, Biden now also faces new pressure to act swiftly while keeping his narrow Democratic majorities in the House and Senate unified -- a tricky task that could make or break his presidency in its first year.
The party's wish list is long and every senator will effectively have veto power on each piece of legislation. But the early hurdles that many in the party were fretting over days ago fell overnight.
With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote, Biden will now be able to confirm his Cabinet picks and future judicial nominees on party line votes, overturn rules put in place by agencies run by President Donald Trump's administration, and begin the work of crafting a major economic stimulus package on the scale desired by Democrats without being forced to negotiate for Republican support.
Instead, the leverage will shift to the left -- but only as far as Senate moderates, who make up most of the new majority, allow it to go. The odds that Democrats pass big ticket progressive legislation is only fractionally greater than it was on Monday, with future Majority Leader Chuck Schumer either needing a united conference, or the support of GOP defectors, to make it happen. Liberal gains will likely happen on the margins, but with Biden pushing for a massive Covid relief package out of the gate, those gains could have outsized consequences.
""It is impossible to overstate how important (Tuesday's) wins are for the Biden presidency. Everything was on the ballot in Georgia -- the economy, healthcare, Covid, the courts,"" said Guy Cecil, chairman of Democratic super PAC Priorities USA. ""This means real change won't be relegated to executive orders. Now, President Biden and Congressional Democrats need to deliver.""
Biden set the stakes during an eleventh hour campaign rally for the Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, now Georgia's Democratic senators-elect, on Monday in Atlanta.
""If you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington,"" Biden said, ""those $2,000 (stimulus) checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people who are struggling right now.""
And he cheered the results on Wednesday, saying that ""Georgia's voters delivered a resounding message"" and that ""they want action on the crises we face and they want it right now.""
In a conciliatory note, Biden also emphasized that he was prepared to work with both Democrats and Republicans, naming a range of issues, from the coronavirus fight, to providing relief to struggling families, along with climate change, racial justice and voting rights.
 New pressure on Biden and Schumer 
But Warnock and Ossoff's victories will have further reaching effects than the short-term imperative of combating the pandemic and its economic fallout. McConnell will no longer set the legislative agenda. Bills passed out of the House will, at the least, get a look from the Senate. Victory in Georgia will also embolden party progressives to lean harder on leadership to wield their unexpected new power.
""Where as before (winning the Senate majority) we were going to need to put wind in the Democrats' sails to bring their fight to the American people and pressure Republicans, our work now is much more focused on pushing the Democrats to be bold and seize the possibility that exists in this moment,"" said Sunrise Movement political director Evan Weber. ""This is a once in a generation opportunity to pass historic legislation to act on the major crises of our time, especially climate change, and we can't accept half measures.""
For outside groups that worked in Georgia, the wins both validate the time and money they had poured into 2020 races and encourage them that issues they have long organized around could actually be addressed in the first two years of a Biden presidency.
""Winning the presidency took our country back from the brink of fascism. Now, we have the chance to move an agenda that actually changes people's lives,"" said Jess Morales Rocketto, a top operative for the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The group ran one of the largest voter contact programs in Georgia, a state they considered their flagship electoral challenge.
""The Biden administration has the incredible opportunity to use this resounding Democratic mandate and make good on every campaign promise,"" Rocketto added, ""but they have to do it on day one and without fear.""
Brian Lemek, the executive director of Brady PAC, the political arm of the oldest gun violence prevention organization, said you ""can't understate the enormity of these two wins in Georgia.""
""While the margins in both the House and the Senate are razor thin,"" said Lemek, ""they give Biden and Democrats a tremendous upper hand and a real opportunity to pass meaningful legislation that improves the lives of millions of Americans.""
Back in December, during a virtual meeting with constituents in New York City, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave a glimpse into what he expected to happen if the party won back the chamber and he was elevated to majority leader.
""Joe Biden, I think, will introduce something similar to the Heroes Act, which is $3.4 trillion and deals with all the issues that you're talking about,"" Schumer said, addressing a question about economic aid to small businesses. ""And if I get the majority I will put it on the floor and it will pass. Because it only needs reconciliation, 51 votes.""
With Vice President-elect Harris -- who could end up being a fixture on Capitol Hill in the coming months -- as the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, Schumer has just that. But like Biden, he could also be facing a more difficult job in keeping his conference in lockstep. His majority comes with the finest possible margin and the New Yorker will need to carve out agreement across the party's ideological lines, from centrist Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to progressives like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders.
As news of the Georgia victories began to sink in Wednesday on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats began to discuss their priorities. Most said that a coronavirus relief bill topped the list, specifically one that includes $2,000 checks to many Americans.
Beyond that, however, the next steps are slightly unclear. Action on climate change, structural racism and economic inequality all now seem closer within reach. Biden will likely set the agenda.
""We need to fix a lot of the damage Trump's done and then there's pent-up demand for a whole lot of things. What do we do about climate and about racial inequality, about wealth inequality, about structural racism,"" said Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown.
New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a progressive who was sworn-in for his first term on Sunday, said the Senate's swing toward Democrats, along with the split in the GOP over Trump's effort to overturn his election defeat, cleared a new, wider path to action.
""Now we can fight amongst ourselves within the Democratic Party and push for the policies that we know the majority of the American people want and need and demand,"" Bowman said. ""And quite frankly, I'm going to be looking very closely at the Republicans who are not supporting the circus that Trump and some Republicans are trying to create today, because that may present opportunities for collaboration and true bipartisan leadership going forward.""
Republicans face a Trump hangover
On the other side of the aisle, the blame game is in full swing.
For Republicans who worked to control the Senate, the story in Georgia was one that repeated throughout the country: The suburbs rejected Donald Trump's GOP in 2018 and were a crucial piece of the Democratic coalition in 2020. Biden pulled significant support from one-time Republican strongholds, in part, because of Trump's erratic behavior and promotion of conspiracy theories.
Republicans like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp sought to combat the trend by appointing Loeffler to an open seat, believing that she could bring suburban Republicans -- specifically women -- back home. But Loeffler largely abandoned appeals to moderates and put her lot in with Trump, embracing his language and pledging to join Republicans in their electoral college stunt.
As results became clear early Wednesday morning, a gloom fell over Republicans as the silver linings from the general election -- when they picked up seats in the House and appeared to be on track to hold on to the Senate -- were stripped away.
""We are waking up to a very different Washington today than we did yesterday,"" said Matt Gorman, a longtime Republican operative who previously worked as a top spokesperson at the National Republican Congressional Committee. ""This really changes everything for the next two years.""
Gorman acknowledged that Biden now can pick almost anyone he wants for his Cabinet and judicial appointments and that passing major legislative achievements just got a lot easier.
""I don't think Joe Biden is suddenly going to become Bernie Sanders,"" Gorman said, ""but not having to go through Mitch McConnell for his agenda absolutely empowers him to go further to the left than he anticipated.""

223,"The supply of the Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine is set for a big boost, as its fierce competitor, Merck & Co., has agreed to help produce the shots.
Under the deal, to be announced later Tuesday by President Biden, one Merck facility in the United States will manufacture the vaccine, while a second facility will package it.
PFIZER TESTING THIRD DOSE OF VACCINE TO PROTECT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS VARIANTS
The arrangement could double the production of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, according to a Biden administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to the Washington Post. The official said the administration had been looking for a way to boost production since it became clear that Johnson & Johnson had fallen behind on manufacturing its vaccine.
It’s not clear how soon Merck will begin producing the vaccine. It could take two months to get the production facility ready and even longer to get the production facility up and running.

As of Monday, 96 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines had been distributed. Nearly 77 million have been administered, with over 50 million people receiving at least one dose and more than 25 million receiving two.

224,"
It's been a roller-coaster year and I feel compelled to share my personal experience with COVID-19 in the hopes of changing someone's mind - or even saving a life.
Let's say I told you the upcoming Powerball numbers or gave you the winning ticket for a car or a house. You'd probably run straight for that huge financial reward. But even though the COVID-19 vaccination has proven benefits, I still see way too many are not willing to step up and protect themselves or their loved ones during these difficult times.
In January, as part of the Seminole County effort to boost vaccination among Hispanics over 65, I made it my mission to get people vaccinated.
For their own personal reasons, some of my friends, those that I have known for a very long time, refused to get vaccinated. I get it - this was their personal choice and though I was disappointed, I respected it.
Sadly, several weeks later a close friend I've known my whole life contracted COVID-19 and a month later passed away. He regretted not getting the vaccine when he had the opportunity to do so. Now it was too late. In essence, I gave him the winning lottery numbers and he chose not to play them.
With the recent increase in infections across many areas of Florida and the United States, we are seeing a high percentage of those hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated.
Last year our niece passed away from this virus while in the hospital being treated for something else. She did nothing wrong, yet sadly it took her beautiful life.
Then in December, I contracted this horrible, dreaded virus which I unknowingly and regrettably passed to my wife, Virginia. I also exposed my mother-in-law and my elderly parents. Thankfully, we got them vaccinated immediately and they never contracted COVID-19.
I believe eradicating this disease is contingent upon everyone doing their part by vaccinating, masking and/or social distancing. We have learned so much in the past year and a half since this first appeared. Because there is so much unverified and misinformation on the internet, I wanted to share my own, personal experience so you know the truth.
I don't believe in mandatory vaccinations, but do encourage people to consider vaccinating, so they do not regret it later. This virus is ugly and no one should become infected or possibly die because they are ill-informed. Virginia and I made the personal choice, although we already had COVID-19 and the antibodies in our system, to get the Pfizer vaccine in April. The main reason is we did not want to go through catching COVID-19 again, especially with the Delta variant running rampant.
Also, we love cruising and traveling. It seems like the new normal, to be able to enjoy all these things, is to be vaccinated. The unvaccinated have the right to do all of these activities, but tests and other hurdles make it more difficult. This is just the reality.
I'm doing my part to try to eradicate this thing. It's how I am giving back to my community. I hope we all can do the same.
It's been 8 months and I still don't have my sense of smell or taste back. Try eating your favorite Spanish food without being able to taste it - and Virginia cooks great Spanish food!
I know some will want to talk to me about all the theories, websites and other information and misinformation out there. Trust me, I've seen and read them all. My comment to all is, ""I respect your decisions; please respect mine.""
At the end, we are all on borrowed time in this life. Let's all make sure we are here long enough to enjoy our lives and families.

225,"There have been 9,322 additional coronavirus cases accumulated in the past seven days, according to data from the Pennsylvania Department of Health. The seven-day moving average of newly reported cases was 1,332 cases per day, up 18.7% from a week ago, and more than double the 603 average daily cases recorded four weeks ago.
While cases increase statewide, the rate of increase is moderating: cases this week are up about 20% compared with last, but last weeks case count had increased more than 40% from the week before. Cases counts are rising in 46 of Pennsylvanias 67 counties, declining in 16 counties, and holding steady in 5 counties.
The latest variant surveillance shows that omicron subvariant BA.2.12.1 is making its presence known, accounting for about 19% of new infections nationwide for the week ending April 16. In health care region 3, which includes Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia, the new subvariant accounted for about 13% of all coronavirus infections the week ending April 9, but almost doubled to 24% the week ending April 16. The BA.2 subvariant accounted for 73% of the regions cases the previous week, but has declined to just under 70% for the current week.
The new subvariant accounted for less than 1% of cases in the U.S. and region 3 a month ago.
Community Levels
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now lists three counties  -  Bradford, Sullivan and Susquehanna  -  as having high community levels, meaning that indoor masking and social distancing are recommended. That metric includes current case loads and transmission rates as well as hospital usage.
Tioga County, Bradfords western neighbor, has a medium community level. The other 63 counties, including all in the Lehigh Valley area, remain in the low community level category. The CDC tool is updated weekly.
To date, there have been 2.8 million infections statewide.
Deaths
There were 118 additional deaths reported this week. The seven-day moving average of deaths per day is 16.9, compared with 10 a week ago, an increase of 68.6% in the last seven days. Pennsylvania has recorded 44,592 deaths since March 2020.
Hospitalizations
There were 500 people hospitalized as of midday Friday compared with 509 Thursday. Of those, 68 were in intensive care, and 34 were on ventilators. Statewide hospitalizations have increased 12% over the last week, but are down 24% in the last 30 days.
Hospitals in the Lehigh Valley reported 47 COVID-19 patients Friday compared with 46 Thursday, including six in intensive care, and four on ventilators. Local hospitalizations have increased 16.3% over the last week, and are up 5.7% in the last 30 days.
Vaccinations
The latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show:
There are 8.72 million fully vaccinated people in Pennsylvania, accounting for 68.1% of the population. An additional 2.1 million people are in need of their follow-up shot. In total, 22.6 million shots have been put into the arms of 10.83 million people, or 84.6% of the states residents.
Included in those statewide numbers are 476,243 Lehigh Valley residents who are fully vaccinated, accounting for 70.6% of the local population. In total, 553,975 locals have received 1,178,690 shots in the arm, accounting for 82.1% of the Valleys population.
An average of 13,138 vaccinations are being administered to Pennsylvania residents each day, according to CDC data. Of those, 3,822 are first doses. The number of total vaccinations per day is up 53.1% over the last 30 days. The number of first doses being given per day is up 38% over the last 30 days.
Lehigh Valley
Cases: 605 additional case reports this week, with 301 in Lehigh County, 304 in Northampton County. That brings the total to 170,118.
Deaths: Five new deaths this week (one in Lehigh County, and four in Northampton County). That brings the total to 2,326 (1,236 in Lehigh, and 1,090 in Northa

227,"U.S. government says passport waits top 3 months
WASHINGTON - Americans hoping to travel abroad this summer may have to delay their plans if they need new or renewed passports.
The State Department said Wednesday that the wait for a passport is now between 12 weeks and 18 weeks, even if you pay for expedited processing. That's because of ripple effects from the coronavirus pandemic that caused extreme disruptions to the process at domestic issuance facilities and overseas embassies and consulates.
A department official says a backlog of 1.5 million to 2 million passport requests means that applications submitted now probably will not be processed until the fall.
DOJ: Naturopathic physician sold fake COVID vaccine cards
SAN FRANCISCO - A naturopathic physician in Northern California has been arrested and charged after federal prosecutors said she sold fake COVID-19 immunization treatments and fraudulent vaccination cards that made it seem like customers received Moderna vaccines.
Juli A. Mazi, 41, of Napa, was charged with one count of wire fraud and one count of false statements related to health care matters, the U.S. Department of Justice said in a statement Wednesday.
The case is the first federal criminal fraud prosecution related to homeoprophylaxis immunizations and fraudulent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 vaccination cards, the department said.

235,"Aug. 12 - GODFREY  -  The Newby family blends in very well on evening journeys around its Godfrey subdivision. Just a young couple with their baby daughter, who's in a stroller relaxing.
But there's one thing a bit different about the idyllic scene. Eric Newby is in a wheelchair. And not just any wheelchair, but a the 40-pound kind used in competitions such as racing and wheelchair basketball.
Or wheelchair rugby, too. Tokyo Paralympics wheelchair rugby, in fact.
Newby, 33, of Godfrey, is finishing up his last stages of training for the United States Wheelchair Rugby Team which will take part in the Tokyo Paralympics, which are set to get under way in late August.
""We leave in six days,"" Newby said Wednesday by phone from Birmingham, Alabama, where he and the rest of the team are training. ""The team is looking very strong. Training is going really well.""
Newby, who was born in Alton, lives in Godfrey with his young family. As a youth, he moved with his family to Nashville, Illinois and graduated from Nashville High School. He attended Maryville University in St. Louis. He still had family in the Godfrey/Alton area and he and his wife, Megan, settled there. He previously also lived in Colorado, which is where is employer is based.
His job doing community outreach for Mobility of Denver allows him to work from home  -  or from Biremingham, Alabama if need be.
Newby will be making his second consecutive Paralympics appearance. At the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, the Ameericans brought home the silver medal after losing to Australia by one point in double overtime in the final.
In Tokyo, Newby and the U.S. will open pool play on Aug. 24 against New Zealand at 9:30 p.m. Central Time. The next game for the Americans will be Aug. 25 against Canada, also at 9:30 p.m. Central Time. The third game for the U.S. will be Aug. 27 against Great Britain, at 3:30 a.m. Central Time.
""We'll be there for the opening ceremonies too,"" Newby said, ""but because of COVID regulations, we'll have to leave Japan within 48 hours of our final event.
""The top five teams in the world are Australia, the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom and Canada,"" he said. ""Anytime those five get together, any of them can win and most of the games are close.""
Newby found himself in his wheelchair after an auto crash the night of his high school graduation from Nashville High School, just three weeks after he turned 18. It left him paralyzed from the chest down, with partial use of his hands, but full use of his arms.
After the crash, he lost some 50 pounds and was going through rehab when he became interested in wheelchair rugby after watching a documentary about the sport. His interested grew and he devoted himself to it.
""I have a very supportive family,"" Newby said. ""They supported me through it and they still do. And the people at the Club Fitness gym where I work out and the people around the neighborhood are very supportive, too.""
In the crash, Newby broke his neck, which left his hands not fully functional. He does, however have use of his his arms and has often driven himself to Alabama for training camps with the team.
Newby went to a clinic about wheelchair rugby, then worked his way up the ladder until he made the U.S. team. It wasn't easy, but he said it was worth it. Newby, who is 6-foot-5, had lifted weights prior to the crash and that helped him in his drive to make the U.S. team.
""Seeing guys (in the documentary) who were lower-functioning than me live independently inspired me,"" he said.
""It was a lifesaver,"" Newby said of the sport. ""It's kind of like high-speed chess with contact.""
According to a biography by Team USA, Newby ""found wheelchair rugby in 2006 and tried out for the national team three years later. He was cut, but improved his game and by 2013, he made the team and was named U.S. Quad Rugby Association Player of the Year.""
In his early days with the sport, Newby met the coach of the St. Louis Rams wheelchair rugby team and the day he was released from rehabilitation, he went to his first practice.
To qualify for wheelchair rugby, athletes must have a disability that affects their arms and legs. Each team member receives a classification number ranging from 0.0, which indicates the least amount of physical function, to 3.5, indicating the most amount of function. Newby is classified at 2.0.
After playing in leagues, he tried out for the U.S. developmental team. He didn't make the cut in 2009, but did in 2013.
It's definitely not a sport for the faint of heart.
""I've been battling a few injuries, including an elbow,"" Newby said. He has also suffered broken ribs, a dislocated knee, as well as a broken thumb.
The Paralympics will take place in the same facilities used for the recent Tokyo Olympics. They will also operate under essentially the same COVID restrictions, which means no family members or fans can accompany the teams or athletes.
""It's too bad we can't have family there,"" Newby said. ""But I know they'll be watching and supporting us.""

DALLAS, April 13, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- While there may not be an official return-to-the-new-norm date, one thing is for certain; Americans are beginning to rebuild their closet for the inevitable comeback and seeking new transitional pieces from their overly worn pandemic sweats. Haggar Clothing Co. is providing the much-needed solution for back-to-occasion wear.Haggar Clothing Co., America's leading men's dress pant and apparel brand, is providing the much-needed solution for back-to-occasion wear. With products such as the Cool Right® Performance Flex Pant, Haggar fulfills the new demand with innovative features including four-way stretch fabrics, comfort waistbands, moisture-wicking properties, wash & wear products, and eco-friendly yarns.  
Over the past month, Haggar has seen a revival of business in both dress and casual wear. Traffic in retail stores and sales of Haggar products have rebounded earlier than expected and beyond what the company originally anticipated with numbers that approach, or even exceed, their 2019 sales performance. 
""Weddings, graduations, and other events that were once postponed are now being planned, creating a sales surge for jackets, dress pants, and khakis. Our data and sales results tell us that people are growing confident about going out and are feeling the need to socialize,"" said Michael Stitt, President and Chief Executive Officer of Haggar Clothing Co.

Notably, nationwide purchases of Haggar products over the last two weeks were within 10% of pre-pandemic numbers. 
And then there's the practical matter of a wardrobe refresh. Whether it's the change in physique à la ""the COVID-15"" that is prompting the over-indexing sales of larger sizes that Haggar data illustrates, or the very real fact that many are interviewing for their next career move, one thing is for certain – people need new clothes for specific occasions in their life.  
""Clothes don't make the person, but they make the first impression. You're not going to show up to your first date or interview in your 2020 sweats,"" said Tony Anzovino, Chief Merchandising and Sourcing Officer, Haggar Clothing Co. ""You're going to dress even better than the occasion calls for. It's the old saying, 'dress for the job you want.'""

Haggar expects that confidence will continue to build and is pleased to provide fashion-right, comfortable, easy-care clothing to American consumers over the months to come.

238,"Warwick’s Jenna Ober admits that it’s hard to believe it’s her final season swimming for the Warriors.
That being said, she and the other Warwick seniors are planning to make the most of it, especially coming out of a crazy junior season that was shortened greatly by the COVID-19 pandemic.
“It’s crazy. Time flies,” she said. “There’s a lot more things I am appreciating now because we have the chance that we didn’t get to last year.”
Ober did her part on Thursday, when the Warriors traveled to the Lampeter YMCA to take on Lampeter-Strasburg in a nonleague meet. She won two individual events — the 200-yard individual medley (2:26.17) and 500 freestyle (5:46.97).
Junior teammate Melanie Hahn also earned a pair of firsts — 200 free (2:05.27) and the 100 butterfly (1:03.66) helping Warwick’s girls win 113-57.
Fellow senior Theo Lance did the same in the boys meet, as did junior Brenden Stuhltrager, leading the Warriors to a 94-46 victory.
The tone was set early in the opening race as Warwick finished both first and second in the girls 200 medley relay. Three seniors, Kendall Eby, Elizabeth Perot and Isabel Miller, were anchored by sophomore Tenra Adams to win with a time of 1:56.73.
According to Warriors coach Mark Daum, the Class of 2022 is an amazing group for many reasons.
“They’ve been through a lot with pre-COVID and post-COVID, including the stress from the neck up,” the coach said. “It’s not to belittle any other senior class, but if you had gone through what this group has gone through. ... They are amazingly resilient, and the best years are yet to come for them.
“I can’t wait to see what they do with the rest of their lives. They are going to have great careers in whatever they choose to do. I am just happy being a side part of it.”
After her squad won all 11 races, Ober said Tuesday’s meet was about more than scoring points.
“Just coming together as a team, cheering for each other and swimming fast,” she said. “Just supporting each other no matter is really what’s important.”
Lance pulled off the rare combo of winning the sprint, 50 free in 23.36, and distance, 500 free with a 5:24.50.
“He is so versatile. He can do almost anything,” Daum said. “I don’t mean to put an “S” on his chest, but he is a phenomenal talent. He’s going to (Division I) Marist and they are getting a gold mine.”
Stuhltrager was terrific in the IM, finishing in 2:09.58. He also won the 100 free in 50.59.
Junior Ryan Smecker earned the only victories for Lampeter-Strasburg. Smecker took the honors in the 100 butterfly (1:01.11) and 100 backstroke (1:02.10).
Pioneers coach Kylie Turner knows that scoring more points than teams like Warwick is a lot to ask. Still, the early season meets are important, and she found successes on Thursday.
“You come to an opponent like Warwick, where they have that solid foundation. They have that depth in each of their events,” she said. “So, today’s message was personal growth.
“Each of them were swimming different events and a lot of them it wasn’t their best events. But it was let’s get a time. You are going to be swimming against fast competitors so it’s going to be fast times. As we went through each of those events, we were circling names, best time, best time. That’s how you motivate your team to go into the Section Two meets in January.”

240,"May 20 - Emma McIntyre likes to step outside her sprawling farmland in Franklin County and glance around.
The New Haven High senior still enjoys one thing about the bucolic view she has known all her life.
""You can't see another house for miles,"" McIntyre said. ""We're right in the middle of nowhere.""
That soon will change for the Shamrocks distance running standout.
McIntyre has been accepted to attend Columbia University in New York City.
Ranked No. 1 in her class of 45, McIntyre might be the smartest student to ever come out of New Haven, a tiny community of 2,089 nestled along the Missouri River a mere 63 miles southwest of St. Louis.
Starting in August, McIntyre will call the prestigious Ivy League school her home for at least the next four years.
From New Haven to New York  -  not a routine move both academically and culturally.
""If anyone can handle it, she can,"" New Haven senior running teammate Caroline Otten said. ""She's so smart. Around here we believe there's nothing she can't do.""
The word smart isn't strong enough to describe McIntyre. Academic genius is more like it.
She has never gotten anything less than an A grade at any level. Her score of 35 on the ACT test, one short of perfection, is the highest ever recorded by a New Haven High student.
McIntyre is so brilliant even teachers and administrators around campus have been known to come to her for advice.
Now she is ready to flex her academic muscles in the Big Apple.
""I know some people are concerned about a small-town girl going to a big-time school,"" New Haven athletics director Jaime Hoener said. ""She'll be fine.""
McIntyre always has wanted to expand her horizons, both educationally and socially. She considers the move up the population ladder to be a challenge.
""I'm a little scared,"" McIntyre said. ""But I'm a lot more excited.""
Although still a small town girl at heart, she yearns for a place with more culture and activity.
The hustle and bustle of her new home will provide all of that.
""I've always kind of known that I would like a place like New York,"" McIntyre said. ""I think I'll like living close to people, too.""
McIntyre already has had a small taste of big city life. She spent a few days in Boston while attending a workshop at Harvard University a few years back.
Last month, Hoener took members of the senior class on a trip to New York City and Washington, D.C. Although the major tourist attractions were shut down because of COVID-19 concerns, McIntyre got a preview of what's to come.
""She just had a big smile on her face from the second we got there to the time we left,"" Hoener said. ""She was embracing everything.""
McIntyre captured first place in the 3,200- and 1,600-meter races at the Class 2 District 2 meet on May 8 in New Haven. She crushed her personal best time in the two-mile event by a whopping 23 seconds with a nifty clocking of 11 minutes, 53 seconds.
A four-time all-state performer in cross country, she is hoping to go out in style at the state meet Friday at Jefferson City High.
McIntyre is one of the most popular students in Franklin County. Her high intellect makes her the go-to person when it comes to problem solving. She readily assists classmates with issues from calculus to accounting.
""I don't mind helping them,"" McIntyre said. ""I'm glad they come to me.""
McIntyre claims to get her smarts from her parents, Jenny (a math major at Missouri S&T University in Rolla) and Dan (an engineering major at the same school).
Her older sister, Julia, also was a valedictorian at New Haven and graduated in 2019.
Emma has lupus, a chronic disease that slows down her immune system. She has limited her exposure to others during the pandemic.
Jenny said it was obvious Emma would become a superstar in the classroom when she learned how to read a book before she even entered kindergarten.
""For some reason, it just sort of comes naturally to me,"" McIntrye said. ""I work at it, but never really struggled picking things up.""
The 18-year-old takes her studies seriously, although she has a playful side as well.
""She used to talk back to us quite a bit,"" Dan recalled.
Added Otten, ""You can tell she's got a little sass in her.""
There are situations when McIntyre is in a world by herself. Normally, she does not like to show off her intellect.
Otten said there are instances where she simply tells her friend to dummy down.
""We'll be in a group and we'll just tell her, 'We have no idea what you're saying  -  so just stop talking,' "" Otten joked.
McIntyre is hoping to become an astrophysicist and work for NASA down the road.
No one is betting against her.
""Her biggest strength is that she doesn't really think she's that smart so she works so hard all of the time,"" Hoener said. ""She's not just book smart, but she's got common sense.""
McIntyre can't wait to get to Columbia. She has been planning for college most of her life.
""It's going to be a challenge, but one I'm ready to take on,"" McIntyre sai

242,"Had his team not lost two games because of COVID-19 issues, Eastons Marcus Williams would likely be over 1,000 yards rushing by now.
The Red Rovers speedster has played in just five games and in a few of those games, Easton had a big lead and Williams didnt play much in the second half.
Williams is averaging more than 9 yards per carry but has just 70 carries through seven weeks of the season.
But while we wait for the first 1,000-yard rusher in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conferences South Division, we have five 1,000-yard passers and four of them are underclassmen.
Bethlehem Catholics Jared Richardson is the lone senior among the five to pass the 1,000-yard mark and Richardson also lost a game due to COVID-related reasons last week.
Nazareths Sonny Sasso, Emmaus Josiah Williams, Libertys Tommy Mason and Central Catholics Tamlin Ferguson have all thrown for more than 1,000 yards in their first seasons as starting quarterbacks and all will return in 2022.

248,"Apr. 13 - After being damaged by Cowlitz River flooding in late 2006, the Lewis County Sheriff's Office east county substation was closed and moved to the old elementary school in Packwood, which the office was also sharing with the White Pass Country Historical Museum.
Sheriff Rob Snaza took office in 2015 and around 2017, he said he began talks with other county officials and staff on moving the substation to the Public Works shop on Kiona Road in Randle, also known as the Kiona Shop.
""The Kiona Shop is a perfect location. It's between Morton and Packwood,"" Snaza said. ""We (would be) able to keep equipment high and dry there. And the one thing I asked for is that we have a location to store search and rescue equipment just in case they are needed up in the east end and to house some vehicles for us.""
Then, in 2018, the Packwood Substation was closed due to staffing shortages and budgetary constraints, according to previous reporting in The Chronicle. The Kiona Shop idea had been discussed, but no action was taken for funding the project. Then, Snaza said, the project fell behind on the list of the county's priorities when the COVID-19 pandemic began.
Commissioner Sean Swope, Snaza said, has since been spearheading the project as the county once again tries to get the ball rolling on the substation.
""Public safety was one of the main things I wanted to focus on for 2022,"" Swope said.
He added this project was a desire for Commissioner Gary Stamper as District 3's representative. After Stamper died in September and Lee Grose was appointed to fill his seat, Swope said he took on a role in the project, as a District 3 commissioner may not be in the seat to see it all the way through.
""From Mossyrock to Packwood, that's something that they need,"" Swope said.
Swope has since been working with the sheriff's office and east county residents to show support for the substation to U.S. Representative Jaime Herrera Beutler's office with the hope of securing funding. He estimates the construction will cost $1.2 million.
Craig Wheeler, spokesperson for Herrera Beutler's office, said: ""Jaime has been in contact with Commissioner Swope and the county about this project and is 100% on board with using her senior position on the Appropriations Committee to secure funds that would help the Lewis County sheriff's office better serve east county citizens.""
Wheeler added the county's formal support is the next necessary step for Herrera Beutler to request funds for the community project.
""Timing is still to be determined,"" Wheeler told The Chronicle. ""Until then, Jaime and her office will continue providing the assistance necessary for it to do so successfully.""
There are a number of reasons why officials, including Grose, Swope and Snaza, think the east end substation is long overdue.
The most compelling to Snaza is the benefit it would have during floods, with the Randle-area flood in November still fresh in his mind.
The sheriff's office's swift water rescue team was used at the time to transport folks through flood waters. As the Cowlitz River rose, residents of the Cascade Peaks Campground RV park were stranded and both state Route 131 and U.S. Highway 12 were closed in portions. The sheriff's office ended up rescuing eight people from the campground and three people from the River Run Ranch area.
""We needed the resources. Coming from Packwood is always going to be challenging ... the resources being in Randle is a central location so that we can be deployed anywhere, whether we go east or west. That is a perfect location so we can take the boat or we can take our large trucks to do rescue operations,"" Snaza said.
Besides what it would mean for rescues, the sheriff added that communities in the east end simply deserve more access to the services a substation could provide. Packwood Fire Chief Lonnie Goble agreed, saying: ""The sheriff's office and the commissioners, they owe it to the people of Packwood. They owe it to every community.""
Those services would include respite for victims of disaster, a place to file complaints with the office or other paperwork and increased response time for crimes and emergencies, ""if we do it right,"" Snaza said.
Goble, who has been chief for 22 of his total 54 years with the department, said response times in the Packwood area currently range ""anywhere from 10 minutes to two and a half to three hours.""
Grose, who is also a Packwood resident, said he knew of instances where, because of concern for high response times, people chose not to call emergency services at all.
""It would be big because we'd have someplace where people would go for law enforcement services, even though they maybe wouldn't do that if they had to call Chehalis,"" Grose said. ""People don't want to call 911 for most things, you know?""
With the current influx of tourism in Lewis County's easternmost town, safety issues have become a more acute concern for residents, according to Goble and Snaza.
""I would say that 99.9% of all people in Packwood are for another substation or something like that in the town of Packwood or somewhere close,"" Goble said.
Like most law enforcement agencies, the sheriff's office still struggles from staffing issues. Snaza said they always try to have one officer in East Lewis County. Asked if the office has the capability to staff a new substation, he said maintaining their duties to the east end is a commitment they intend to keep regardless of the number of deputies they have on hand.
Snaza added the substation was in his top five priorities for the rest of the year, with both him and Swope saying they hoped to break ground on the project within the next few months.
""I don't want to wait another three or four years,"" Snaza said, adding later: ""To see something like this come to fruition would be a great accomplishment.""

FOR IMMEDIATE HIRE-PRETTY PLEASE? Recruiters in tech are desperate for workers. But candidates are the ones who hold all the power. BY SUSAN DOMINUS

On some of her very long days, and most of her workdays of late are very long, Tiffany Dyba, a 39-year-old recruiter in New York, recalls with a little nostalgia a hiring job she once held at a luxury-fashion designer. Back then, people were so eager to get her their resumés that a young woman once looked up Dyba's photo on LinkedIn and then waited outside her office on Madison Avenue to intercept her on her way into work. On another occasion, Dyba, making conversation with a possible hire, mentioned that she had a fondness for toffee - and the next day, toffee, beautifully wrapped, appeared in her office. Back then, the people she was hiring were hungry, they were eager. There were flowers. Carefully crafted thank-you notes. Those were things a recruiter might not expect but might occasionally enjoy. A recruiter felt wanted.
But Dyba eventually struck out to work for herself, and then the world changed. A virus flourished, and office buildings emptied, with their tenants uploading their systems to the ether; the cloud filled and then it filled some more, and with that massive digital shift, Dyba found herself, a person who majored in psychology, who could be intimidated briefly by the ""merge calls"" function on her iPhone, working in a field so hot that it is sucking more and more people like her into its ever-expanding vortex: technology recruiting.
Recruiters working in technology these days do not receive candy, flowers or thank-yous. The recruiter is lucky if she can get someone on the phone - if she receives so much as an email in response. Technology workers need court no one: Along with microchips, toilet paper and Covid tests, tech workers will be recalled as one of the great, pressing shortages of this pandemic. Estimates of the unemployment rates for tech workers are about 1.7 percent, compared with roughly 4 percent in the general economy; for those with expertise in cybersecurity, it's more like 0.2 percent. Tech employees today tire of the attention from recruiters, the friendly hellos on LinkedIn, the cold calls (which Dyba does not make). ""They think we're like used-car salesmen,"" Dyba said of her quarry. To be a recruiter in tech is to be an in-demand commodity for those companies doing the hiring but to feel like something of a nuisance - like an essential gear that emits a loud, irritating noise.
In late January, Dyba, working on contract with a tech company on the West Coast, sent out a mass blast on LinkedIn, tailored to reach data analysts, which is to say free of the kind of friendly, conversational fillips she might otherwise include (""Your LinkedIn profile looks amazing"" and ""I hope this finds you well!""). Data analysts - really, they just want the data. ""Hi [name],"" Dyba wrote in the message. ""We're looking for a talented Data Analyst to analyze huge data sets, build predictive models, and help us drive growth. I thought you could be a great fit."" The job she posted listed its selling points - the business had 400 percent growth a year, the backing of a legendary venture capitalist, no limit to personal vacation days, full coverage of employee healthcare premiums and the option to work remote or locally.
Dyba estimates that she sent the listing to about 75 prospective hires and received back maybe five responses, three of which were either a brief ""no thanks"" or the simple declination of her InMail message. A declination - that's LinkedIn language for ""Please, stop throwing all these jobs at me with employerpaid health-insurance premiums and unlimited vacation time.""
Recruiters are in such demand that they, too, are scarce, which means their fees have never been higher. In-house tech-recruiter salaries are up about 30 percent, estimates Daniel Wert, who works at a boutique executive-search firm in the design community. Organizations looking for help in cloud and cybersecurity positions have increased fees they are offering to recruiting services to as high as 45 percent of the first year's salary, says Ryan Sutton, a district president in charge of technology recruiting for the staffing firm Robert Half. Dyba says she has more work than she has had since she started freelancerecruiting in 2018.
Dyba's challenges - most tech recruiters' challenges - go beyond simply finding humans. As the people talking to potential hires, recruiters have a big-picture view of just how quickly the market is currently moving, something they need to translate to hiring managers without giving the impression they're doing a hard sell. Dyba recently wrote to an executive who was hesitating to make an offer on a hire who was slipping away, texting a kind of recruiter haiku:
we need to move
if we are gonna move
just thought I would tell you
Recruiters are often in the position of breaking the bad news that a desired candidate has flat-out rejected an offer, often to executives used to having the upper hand in the market or to founders convinced their business is more innovative than Apple and with better snacks than Facebook.
Jana Rich, founder and chief executive of Rich Talent Group, a firm that primarily recruits executives to companies in the tech and consumer industries, says that even at the highest levels of hiring, she has never seen a market like this in 30 years. It falls on her, sometimes, to have what she calls ""the truth talk"" with a chief executive or board member: to break the news that qualified candidates have multiple - or sometimes preferable - opportunities. Now, she gently explains, an employer might have to think about taking a leap of faith on someone very talented but slightly less experienced. It doesn't always go well. Following a recent truth talk, she said, the company put the search on pause, making it clear that ""basically, 'We, the company, don't necessarily believe you,' "" she said. ""Like, 'We think we can do better.' ""
Pent-up demand after those early pandemic months when no one was hiring is part of the problem, Rich says. And a general feeling of pandemic malaise can help explain the shortage of potential hires - every so often, she reaches out to someone with a top-level job, only to hear, as she put it, ""I don't know if I have the energy in the tank.""
Highly skilled tech workers, for the most part, are not leaving the workplace - the money right now is simply too good (salaries have risen in some cities by as much as 10 percent). They are, however, leaving the workspace, in droves, to work remotely, which is another aspect of the new world of work that recruiters need to communicate to founders and chief executives, some of whom are intent on getting the office back to what it once was.
""If you are not going to offer remote work, if you're not going to offer at least hybrid, we can't help you,"" Sutton says he tells clients trying to hire software designers. Tatiana Becker, the founder of NIAH Recruiting, was called in to help another recruiter from a different firm, who had already contacted every local potential candidate to fi ll a chief-of-staff position at an online retailer that hoped to have its employees in the office full time. After Becker told her colleague that the employer was going to have to drop one of the three requirements to fill the position - ideally, the one that called for regular on-site work in New York - the client wrote her a snippy email making it clear that Becker's help was no longer wanted: ""Unfortunately the recommendation you made to drop one or two of our requirements,"" the client wrote, ""was frankly completely inappropriate.""
When working with one employer in a city that is not known as a tech hub, Dyba felt that she had to chip away, carefully, at the company's insistence for on-site workers; one position had been open for six months. Dyba started showing the hiring manager the credentials for someone she'd found, but omitted a crucial detail. If the employer was interested, then and only then did she reveal that the talent was based in Florida or Boston. ""I had to kind of say, 'Listen, it's costing more money right now for us to keep this job open than it would be for you to send someone a laptop and coach your leadership team differently about how to manage remotely,' "" she said. She believes the hiring manager raised the issue with the chief executive; slowly, someone with decision-making power came around, and Dyba was able to start filling positions. When the pandemic ebbs and local workers are back in that office, 15 to 20 percent of its work force will be remote. The market rather than Dyba changed the company's workplace culture - a market of empowered technology workers who could pick and choose their employers, who could take or leave any job they wanted and were forcing a shift.
Dyba hit a low back in October, when after working for months to land a signed offer for a qualified candidate for one company, she then lost that hire when the candidate's current employer swooped in with a generous, last-minute retention bonus. She had a signed offer! That had never happened to her before. Now she counts on nothing: ""I don't stop interviewing until I have a butt in the seat - like I am aggressively still looking for candidates even after we have a signed offer.""
Workplaces also keep shifting unpredictably in ways that wreak havoc on the hiring process. A business doesn't have a vaccine requirement, then it does. Employees are told they can work remotely and then the employer starts floating the idea that everyone will need to come back. Between constantly changing conditions and the number of counteroffers that job candidates receive, Sutton says, around four in five of the deals his recruiters try to seal end up requiring last-minute finessing on some major point; that happened only about 30 percent of the time before the pandemic, he estimates.
By late January, Dyba had been trying for several months, with mounting frustration, to find someone for a senior position for a highgrowth start-up whose executive team insisted that the position be filled by someone willing to work at least part time on-site in New York. The calculation, when chief executives still make it, has become an interesting leap of faith. It reflects a belief that having a team on the ground, regularly working together, sharing the air and locking eyes across a conference table, will yield greater success than handpicking the most talented, experienced team a recruiter could possibly source from all 50 states and having them forge some new kind of work environment from their respective remote locales.
All day long, Dyba sent out feelers, and all day she got back messages on LinkedIn, variations on the same thing: ""Is there any chance that this position could be 100 percent remote?"" one woman asked. ""If not, I would not be interested in hearing more about the role."" Dyba visited the start-up's New York office, which was, predictably, filled with great light and had Kombucha on tap. It was vast, the lease signed during the pandemic. It was also basically empty. Dyba had to wonder in what numbers even current employees would eventually return to on-site work.
At least that other client, the tech employer on the West Coast seeking a data analyst, was willing to let whoever filled that position work entirely remotely. In late January, around 5:30 p.m., Dyba got on a screening call with a potential candidate. By then, she had reached the stage of day when her hair was up in a messy bun held with a pen. She was working in her bedroom, in green thermal pants and a Henley - it was not a big Zoom day - and her ancient Corgi was snoozing by her side. The day had been nonstop, and she hadn't paused to drink any water, which she was now compensating for by chugging from a bottle while the candidate spoke.
""If you wouldn't mind kind of talking me through your background, I would love to hear a little bit more about you and what you've been doing,"" she said. The young man on the other end of the phone was lovely and polite, with a Master of Science degree in business analytics. Dyba was immediately charmed, if only because - unlike so many tech recruits - he didn't start the conversation by asking, within the first six minutes, what the compensation was. He spoke about his background but also seemed to have researched the business itself. The nature of work has changed so much that sometimes, she knows, the recruits don't care: Their top priority is remote work; and if they are going to be doing data analytics at home, a basic disconnect from the larger business can easily set in. (Another recruiter said that when she sends out mass blasts, she often gets back emails that say only three words: ""Rate? Remote? Client?"")
Dyba recognized that there were details on the young man's résumé that the employer might consider less than reassuring - like the fact that his last job had the word ""intern"" in it. ""My fear is that they'll say he doesn't have the experience,"" she said of the tech firm. But still, he impressed her with his obvious intelligence, his sophisticated response to a question about machine learning. She would fight for him and suggest, ""If you're willing to take a chance and help someone start his career, I think it would be a great move."" Maybe they would listen, she thought. Maybe.

253,"On March 5, 2020, with only three dissenting votes, Congress passed the first COVID-19 relief bill, an $8.3-billion emergency measure that turned out to be the opening installment in a vast and expensive effort to deal with the costs of a deadly pandemic.
A year later, the Senate is nearing passage of a $1.9-trillion package proposed by President Biden. The political environment has changed. The bill passed the House last week on a near-party-line vote of 219 to 212, with two Democrats and all the Republicans in opposition. It passed a key hurdle in the Senate on Thursday with Vice President Kamala Harris breaking a tie.
A year ago, when the known U.S. death toll stood at fewer than a dozen, some believed the threat from a novel coronavirus would cause the nation to pull together. More than half a million deaths later, we've learned otherwise: The pandemic deepened the nation's divisions, mostly along partisan lines, even as it shined a harsh light on inequities of race, ethnicity and income that have played a huge role in who lived and who died, who lost a job and who did not.

""No country was as politically divided over its government's handling of the outbreak as the U.S.,"" the nonpartisan Pew Research Center discovered last summer in a 14-nation survey of public opinion. In some respects, U.S. divisions have grown even starker, Pew finds in a large-scale new study released Friday.
Biden's hope is that the rapid ramp-up of vacci- nations -- the U.S. hit 2 million COVID shots a day on Wednesday -- combined with passage of the relief package will begin to return the country to normal, repairing both the physical and economic ravages the virus has caused.
Beyond that, he has a broader and more challenging goal: Just as COVID worsened the nation's divisions, he believes that resolving the pandemic can begin to narrow them.

Divided public amid growing optimism
Right now, that seems a tall order. Several recent surveys have shown the public growing more optimistic that the worst of the pandemic is behind us -- Gallup reported Friday that for the first time, a majority of Americans now perceive the COVID situation as getting better. But the good news has generated new arguments.
On Tuesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott and Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves announced they were ending mask mandates in their states, despite public health advice to the contrary.
Biden the next day called those decisions examples of ""Neanderthal thinking.""
The warring words reflected how much the partisan divide continues to shape the U.S. response.
From the earliest weeks of the outbreak, Republicans were far less concerned about COVID than Democrats, Pew's data show. That gap grew steadily through last spring, fanned by President Trump, but also driven by the deeply ingrained skepticism toward government, disdain for experts and opposition to economic restrictions that characterize American conservatism.
Those same attitudes can now be seen when surveys ask about vaccination.
The share of Americans who say they probably will get a shot continues to rise, with hesitancy rapidly melting among some groups, especially Black adults, who initially had deep skepticism.
The partisan gap, however, has grown -- 83% of Democrats, but only 56% of Republicans, say they either have already gotten vaccinated or intend to, Pew found. Their poll surveyed 10,121 U.S. adults from Feb. 16 to Feb. 21 and has a margin of error of 1.6 percentage points in either direction.
Biden hopes passage of his COVID plan can narrow the political divides even as it assuages the economic pain of the last year.
The economic part is clear: Although many economists question some aspects of the bill, especially the amount it would send to state and local governments, there's no question that the $1.9-trillion package would aim a firehose of money at lower- and middle-income families that have disproportionately been burned by the pandemic.
Pew's numbers illustrate how unequal the damage has been.
Upper-income Americans -- which Pew defines as those with incomes above around $140,000 a year -- are about four times as likely to say their family finances have actually improved in the last year as to say they have gotten worse, Pew found. That's largely because most better-off Americans have kept their jobs and, with restaurants, theaters and travel shut down, haven't had as much to spend their money on.
The vast majority of upper-income Americans said they had saved at least as much in the last year as they typically do, with nearly a third saying they added more to their savings than usual.
By contrast, among low-income Americans -- those with incomes less than around $45,000 -- roughly one-third say they are worse off now than they were a year ago. Only 1 in 5 say their family incomes have improved. The rest say their situation has remained about the same.
More than 4 in 10 Americans say they or someone in their household lost a job or income since the pandemic hit. Among low-income households, that rises to half. Among those who took a pay cut during the pandemic, about half report they are still earning less than before.
The bill includes $1,400 direct checks; extended unemployment compensation; enhanced assistance to families with children; an expansion of the earned income tax credit, which supplements wages for low-income workers; aid in paying rent; and a 15% increase in food stamp benefits. In all, hundreds of billions of dollars will go to families.
Republicans say that, with the economy already improving, that's a lot more money than is needed. Some warn the flood of new spending will generate inflation. Biden and his economic advisors discount those fears. There's a lot of room to rev the economy without worrying about overheating, they argue.
Beyond the immediate aid, though, the president has a larger ambition, which he touched on during remarks to House Democrats at a meeting Wednesday evening.
""The confidence in the American, in the American government, has been plummeting since the late '60s to what it is now,"" he told them.
Passing the relief bill, he said, will ""show the American people we're capable of coming together for what matters most to them. They've lost faith in government; this is a time to reestablish that faith.""
""I think that people's memories will be long,"" Biden said. Proving that government was able to help when people needed help ""is going to open up a lot of hearts and a lot of doors for us tomorrow to do the many more things we know we have to do.""
During the lowest points of his primary campaign last year, when Biden's bid for the presidency seemed doomed, such sentiments from him drew mockery. It's an audacious hope that still flies against much current wisdom about American politics. Then, again, so did his election.

255,"The NCAA Tournament Selection Committee confirmed it thinks highly of the Big Ten.
The committee released its current top 16 seeds, which included four Big Ten teams: No. 1 seeds Michigan and Ohio State, the top No. 2 seed in Illinois and the top No. 4 seed in Iowa.
In 35 NCAA Tournaments since the field expanded to 64 in 1985, 13 had more than one No. 1 seed from the same conference. The last time that happened in the Big Ten? 2001, when Illinois and Michigan State held top seeds with the Spartans advancing to the Final Four and Illinois to the Elite Eight.
The Big Ten also had two No. 1 seeds in 1993 with Indiana and Michigan.
Theres still about a month left before Selection Sunday, and much is to be determined with makeup games and likely upsets and surges on the way.
Here are some Big Ten takeaways.
1. Illinois has its sights set on a No. 1 seed.
Illinois next four games  against Northwestern, at Minnesota, at Michigan State and against Nebraska  will do little to raise its resume. Wisconsin, which it plays on Feb. 27, is currently listed as No. 18 in the NET ratings.
Luckily for Illinois, it has games left against some potential No. 1 seeds. The Illinis regular-season finale comes March 6 at Ohio State, which already beat Illinois 87-81 in Champaign. They may also get a makeup for their canceled Feb. 11 game against Michigan.
Of course, either of those teams slipping up will help Illinois. And Illinois needs to avoid letdowns.
The Illini almost suffered one at Nebraska before Ayo Dosunmu played hero once again.
While Illinois has won five straight games, avoiding lackluster starts like it had at Nebraska and finding consistency from start to finish will be important down the stretch.
Last season, Illinois was surging as heading into the Big Ten Tournament with an NCAA Tournament run on its mind before the postseason was shut down because of COVID-19. Illinois has a similar momentum in 2021.
It takes winning games like this, Dosunmu said after beating Nebraska. Its not going to be pretty. Thats not the reality of it. We have a goal now. Were trying to win games in a row so when the NCAA Tournament comes, were ready and prepared.
2. Michigan didnt miss a beat.
The Wolverines would have been forgiven for looking rusty in their first game back after 23 days off because of COVID-19 protocol. It took them only a half to warm up.
Michigan (14-1, 9-1) put together a dominant second half to beat Wisconsin 67-59 Sunday in Madison, Wis.
Down 14 points in the first half and trailing by seven points midway into the second half, Michigan allowed just two Wisconsin field goals and eight points in the last 10 minutes 56 seconds to outscore the Badgers 40-20 after halftime.
Their performance made the Selection Committee seem wise for keeping them as a No. 1 seed despite the long layoff and lack of games played compared to other programs.
Can Michigan keep this up? More importantly, can they sustain the momentum during a Big Ten stretch that will include at least three road games and makeup games in a short amount of time?
The Big Ten notes theres no punishment for missing games, but cramming in makeup games certainly seems like an undesirable task for a team that has everything to lose  and so much to gain. (More on this below.)
Coach Juwan Howards approach in resuming play was wise and will serve Michigan well if its schedule becomes overwhelming.
We kept it simple, he told reporters after the win. Simple plays, limiting our mistakes, valuing the basketball. It was a pause so we cant do anything about it. Im going to trust how our guys responded after the long layoff and not making excuses for themselves but coming out here and competing on the road. Winning a game like this on the road says a lot about the character of this group.
3. What games should be made up?
The Big Ten office is dealing with a riddle.
Several teams have makeup games, but only so much time is left on the schedule before the Big Ten Tournament begins in Indianapolis.
We saw the Big Ten tweak its rules for football to make life more advantageous for Ohio State, which carried the conferences best hopes into the College Football Playoffs. Might something similar happen that allows basketball teams like Michigan to keep a shining resume?
If the conference says health and safety is paramount, how does that line up with making teams travel extensively and with quick turnarounds  all while maintaining the premise of prioritizing them as amateur athletes?
That doesnt sound fun, Michigans Isaiah Livers told reporters of possibility of playing 11 games in a few weeks. As much as I would like to, we dont have robotic legs. I wish we didnt feel game soreness or else I would be all for it. But Id be very sore and then going into a postseason, I dont know if that would be the best idea.
Of course, it was nearly a guarantee that games would be canceled while playing during a pandemic, so end-of-season makeup games were to be expected.
Unfortunately, this is a very uncomfortable year, crazy times that we all are dealing with, Howard said. If the main thing is about our health and safety, lets make sure thats the main thing.
There is one game Michigan  and all Big Ten fans  want to see.
Obviously playing Illinois is one I have circled, Livers said. Thats one game Im really hoping they reschedule.
4. Nebraska is in the gauntlet.
Other than logistical obstacles, it would be hard for the Big Ten to give Michigan a break after scheduling a slew of makeup games for the Cornhuskers.
Nebraska lost 77-72 in overtime Friday to Illinois, a makeup game from an earlier cancellation because of COVID-19 issues within the Cornhuskers program. The Huskers flew to Penn State on Saturday and notched their first conference win with a 62-61 victory.
Theyve got no time to rest with back-to-back games Tuesday and Wednesday at Maryland and just two days  including a travel day  before hosting Purdue on Saturday.
Before facing Illinois, Nebraska had lost to Michigan State on Feb. 6, Minnesota on Feb. 8 and Wisconsin on Feb. 10.
Phew.
It hasnt been an easy go for coach Fred Hoiberg, the former Bulls coach who is in his second season with Nebraska. Before beating Penn State, he had lost 26 straight Big Ten games. Nebraska hadnt won since beating NAIA program Doane on Dec. 17, 2020.
I told them, You guys have been knocking on the door; lets go kick that thing down, Hoiberg said after the win. They went out and continue to fight. Thats the thing Im so proud of this group, is how they continue to go out there and battle. For me, yeah, probably a big sense of relief.

256,"May 23 - When Mike and Karen Williams started as sponsors for Naval Academy midshipmen, they started with three plebes.
Now, they have 30 mids that they sponsor, including the ones they unofficially adopted.
""So our little mid family has grown quite large,"" Karen Williams said.
And that growth reflects in the Williams' Severna Park home.
There might be midshipmen spread out in the kitchen. Or in the back den, where a few crowded on a couch.
Or on a nice day, they might be outside around a fire pit. There's even a large outdoor kitchen the Williams built in order to feed the midshipmen.
In any given weekend, in a non-COVID-19 year, there could be up to 35 mids at the Williams' house, Karen Williams said.
But while the Williams' house is a home away from Bancroft Hall, for four midshipmen it was home this semester.
The Williams were one of the sponsor families that took in midshipmen for the spring semester so the Naval Academy could use space in Bancroft Hall for isolation and quarantine, as part of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Midshipmen could also live with families, as long as the family or sponsor lived within 35 miles of the academy.
Four midshipmen that the Williams sponsored called to see if they could live at their house. Luckily, no more called, Karen Williams said. She does not know how she would have chosen who could live there.
The four midshipmen  -  three firsties and one midshipman 2nd class  -  living at the house typically left around 6 or 7 a.m. and did not return until between 5-7 p.m., she said.
They would sometimes plan dinner together, other times the midshipmen would eat on their own time.
Then they might relax in the living room or spend time with the three dogs in the house. The youngest pup, Sailor, has been raised by the midshipmen that come to the Williams' home because the Williams thought the mids needed a puppy.
""Honestly, sometimes I could go a whole day and like not see one of them just because I might be working when they left,"" Karen Williams said. ""And then maybe I was doing something else when they came home and if they had already gone to their room for the night then I never saw them.""
This is their fourth year sponsoring midshipmen, Karen Williams said. They'll be attending their first graduation this year.
The Williams became sponsors after their children left the home, Mike Williams said. There was a quiet they were looking to fill so they looked into the program.
""It's funny,"" Mike WIlliams said. ""I never thought I would have anything to do with the kids from the academy.""
This year, the couple was not going to take in another midshipman, Karen Williams said. They had already become sponsors to several and the unofficial sponsors of the rugby and ice hockey teams.
But there was a midshipman from a Gold Star family that needed a sponsor, and they couldn't say no, she said. The Williams have three sons who served in the armed forces, including one who died from a heart attack while in the service.
During the fall, the midshipmen were not able to visit often due to liberty restrictions, Karen Williams said.
Still, the Williams would find ways to see the midshipmen by bringing them packages that were sent to the house instead of the mailroom or to bring food to the gate. They tried to celebrate birthdays as much as possible.
The Williams are not planning to take on another plebe next academic year so that they can focus on the midshipmen they are already officially and unofficially sponsoring, Karen Williams said.
Sponsors give midshipmen a place for them to relax and rejuvenate, said Rose Clark, director of the sponsor program.
There are currently 2,500 active sponsor families, Clark said. She was unsure how many sponsor families took in midshipmen to live with them this semester as that went through a different office.
Every plebe that wants a sponsor will receive one, she said.
Of the 2,500 active families, many of them are repeat sponsors, Clark said. They'll go back to take more and more  -  like the Williams.
Sponsors come in ranges, with about half of them civilians and half of them military families. There are empty-nesters, who tend to take in three or four at a time, and some who are retired.
The sponsor program tries to match plebes with sponsors that share the same interests. Some families, like the Williams, will say they only want male plebes.
""Most sponsors will take on anywhere from two to maybe four plebes in a plebe summer,"" Clark said. ""But what happens is they'll invite, they'll ask if they can bring their friends over. And then the number grows for the visits, but it doesn't mean they sponsor that many.""
And the sponsors tend to follow their midshipmen for the rest of their lives, attending weddings, watching them have kids, Clark said.
""They're all just so caring,"" she said. ""And they open their house and their hearts to these midshipmen.""
Clark is looking for more sponsors for the class of 2025, she said. Those interested can fill out an application by July 14 at www.usna.edu/spons

Yet despite these significant contributions, many public health leaders say the field as a whole has fallen short of its aspirations, hampered by government underinvestment and a general lack of appreciation for its potential to solve societal problems.This week Dean Linda P. Fried announced a new Centennial Grand Challenges program to elevate the stature of public health and amplify its impact in several priority areas. The grants program will support interdisciplinary projects using cutting-edge research methodologies--with the ultimate goal of re-configuring the way public health research is done at the School and beyond. Applications are now open to faculty; awards will be announced in the spring.The Grand Challenges program enumerates six priority areas: (1) growing health inequities with high rates of obesity and chronic disease; (2) the health impacts of climate change; (3) the expansion of aging populations that could be healthy but are not; 4) the inadequacy of food systems; (5) the global mental health crisis; and (6) the likelihood of increased rates of future pandemics. Other significant research priorities will also be considered.Over the last century, the lifespan of people in the United States grew by 30 years, with much of those gains attributed to public health. Yet significant health disparities persist and our longer lives are often lived in ill-health. These shortfalls are related to chronic underfunding of public health: As much as 70 percent of health is attributed to public health factors, yet just 3 percent of U.S. health dollars support public health research and practice. The COVID-19 pandemic further underscored the consequence of this underfunding, which contributed to widespread illness and death, notably in communities of color.""Grand Challenges is designed to reward faculty who think expansively and work across disciplines to achieve cutting-edge discovery, and harness the rapid changes in science, such as the potential of big data and data science for health, to accelerate solutions and transform health,"" says Gary Miller, the School's Vice Dean for Research Strategy and Innovation.A Research Boom  While overall funding for public health is still far short of what is needed, federal grants for Columbia Mailman faculty have grown significantly over the last two years. In 2019, the School received $46 million in National Institutes of Health Prime grants (a trackable metric that does not account for all federal research funding). Today, the School has $65 million in funding--a 41 percent increase. Compared to peer schools, including those with larger faculties, this jump in funding advanced the School from eighth place to fourth place in NIH funding, and within striking distance of third place.This recent boom in research is not just due to funding for COVID-19-related projects, but instead reflects the broad expertise of the School's faculty. More consequentially, NIH grant applications were up 50 percent over the last two years during a period where the NIH public health dollars grew. Notably, Columbia Mailman saw growth in large grants. Over the last year, the number of faculty with grants over $1 million grew from 12 to 17; and the number of faculty with grants over $2 million grew from 3 to 11. Going forward, the School will position itself to win more large projects of the scale needed to make a difference on the most pressing health challenges.""More important than the numbers and rankings is what they mean: a growing confidence on the part of our peers on our ability to do this important work,"" said Miller. ""We've had incredible growth. It is a testament to the dedication of our faculty, staff, and students who have risen to what is needed for society.""MSTRUCK-7689355 MSTRUCK",Columbia Mailman School of Public Health: Grant Program Supports Research on Societal 'Grand Challenges'

261,"Democrats have been out of power in Florida for more than 20 years. And if they want to reverse the frustration this November, they will need to win over voters like Sandra Link.
The 72-year-old retired former advertising agency owner in Jupiter was once a ""diehard Republican."" Going back to the 1970s, she said, Link reliably voted for the party's presidential candidates. In the evenings, Link said she ""faithfully"" watched Fox News.
But when Donald Trump became the GOP's presidential nominee in 2016, she couldn't cast her ballot for him, she said, feeling repulsed. ""I knew then the kind of lying turncoat Trump was,"" Link said.
Instead, Link said she reluctantly voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton that year. In 2020, Link said she voted for Democrat Joe Biden.
Eventually, she officially left the GOP and changed her voter registration to independent, a sort of wild card or free agent in the parlance of politics.
That makes Link a coveted voter – one of more 3.8 million Florida voters registered as as an NPA, or no party affiliation. Many of them, like Link, formerly identified with one of the major parties until they were turned off for one reason or another.
This year's Democratic candidates for U.S. senator, governor and the three other state Cabinet posts – attorney general, chief financial officer and agriculture commissioner – need to win independents more than ever.
For the first time ever, Republican active voters outnumber Democrats in Florida, by almost 70,000 as of the end of January.
In the 2018 midterm election, by contrast, Democrats counted a comfortable 257,175 registration lead over Republicans, but they still lost the governor's mansion and the U.S. Senate seat.
Since then, Democrats' rank-and-file woes have continued. About 100,000 voters registered as Republicans in January 2021 – when Trump supporters invaded the U.S. Capitol to overturn the 2020 presidential election – have left the party. But even more Democrats – 123,000 of them – have left their party since then.
As voter rolls stand, Florida has 5.13 million registered Republicans and 5.04 million registered Democrats, each party accounting for little more than 35% of the electorate. That makes the 26.9% of NPA voters a potentially decisive swing bloc in a statewide electorate of 14.28 million voters.
Still, at the outset of 2022, the Democrats' statewide prospects look dim.
Even after passing controversial laws and rules, and supporting unpopular legislation on issues ranging from COVID-19 to abortion and LGBTQ rights, polls show Gov. Ron DeSantis leading his would-be Democratic rivals by big margins.
DeSantis leads each of the three Democratic rivals by margins ranging from 8 points to 16 points, according to a Mason-Dixon poll earlier this year. And he counts more than $70 million in his campaign war chest. Two-term U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio leads the expected Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Val Demings, 49% to 42%.
And a poll conducted Feb. 24 by the University of North Florida's Public Opinion Research Lab shows DeSantis leading two would-be Democratic rivals by big margins – 55% to 34% against Congressman Charlie Crist, and 55% to 32% against Agriculture and Consumer Services Commissioner Nikki Fried.
Republicans also say they're more excited than Democrats to vote.
Michael Binder, the lab's faculty director and a professor of political science, said they found that 65% of registered Republicans are ""more enthused than last election"" compared to 49% of Democrats. ""This suggests Republicans might be trending toward a larger turnout advantage,"" he said in a statement.
Another potentially bad omen: Last month, Democrats lost a seat they formerly held in the partisan Jacksonville city council when the Republican candidate won a special election.
But some high-profile Florida GOP policies also highly unpopular
But even as Florida has trended crimson, the red-meat GOP politics of the past generation have led to narrower victories for the party's gubernatorial candidates.
In 2002, Jeb Bush became the first Florida Republican governor to win re-election with a hefty 655,418-vote margin of victory at a time when Democrats had a 345,000 voter advantage. Four years later, Charlie Crist easily succeeded him, but with half the gap – 341,556 votes – that Bush enjoyed.
Rick Scott subsequently won his gubernatorial elections by just 10% of the margin Bush scored – 61,550 votes in 2010 and 64,145 votes in 2014. DeSantis won in 2018 by 5%, 32,463 votes, of Bush's gap.
Polls suggest that while enthusiastic Republicans are confident of victory this year, some of their favorite policies draw opposition broad from Floridians.
The UNF voter survey that found wide margins for DeSantis also showed significant opposition to three legislative measures the governor and the Republican-dominated Florida Legislature backed this year:
Some 55% opposed banning abortions in Florida after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Another controversial legislative measure, the so-called 'Don't Say Gay' bill to prohibit discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity in schools, registered just 40% support.
And the push to change Florida's Constitution to require partisan school board elections drew only 32% approval.
DeSantis also supports bills that would punish teachers for discussing race, gender or sexuality. The so-called Parental Rights in Education bill, dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill by opponents, would also force school officials to out students to their parents, even if kids wanted to confide with a trusted teacher about their sexuality. It would also allow parents to sue schools over these discussions.
""I was never really all that on board with the social-policy-type stuff where the Christian right and that voter bloc ... feels very strongly about abortion, about gays,"" self-described ""lifelong conservative Christian"" David Gritter of Jupiter said.
""My take on the issue is, A, why does it bother you so much? And B, it's not your business. It doesn't affect you. You have no right to tell people how to live their lives. And it's pretty messed up you're trying to get the government to tell people how to live their lives.""
And, emboldened by the Supreme Court taking up a direct challenge from Mississippi to its 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, Florida GOP lawmakers are pushing to ban most abortions statewide after 15 weeks, down from the current 24 weeks. With no exceptions for victims of rape or incest, it would be the biggest restrictions to abortion access since the Supreme Court ruled on its constitutionality.
When it comes to abortion access, Link, the former Republican in Jupiter, describes herself as ""pro-choice."" ""If that law changes, it's going to go back to trailer parks in Toledo, Ohio, and trailer parks in Florida,"" the Ohio native said. ""I don't think men should speak on antiabortion.""
Link, like many old-school Republicans, those who believe in limited government, say they no longer felt comfortable within the GOP ranks.
""When I was a Republican, I was a very liberal Republican,"" she said. ""The basic reason I was always a Republican – beside that's because how I was raised – is because I don't believe in big government.""
Jay Ailworth, a registered Republican in Palm Beach County, said he voted for DeSantis in 2018. And during the 2019 hurricane season, the Vietnam War veteran was pleased with the governor. But no longer.
""When he started dealing with the hurricane issues, I went, 'Ya know what? He's not really all that bad,' "" Ailworth said. ""But when COVID hit, he fell straight in line with Trump.""
An unprecedented number of voters such as Ailworth cast their ballots by mail in 2020 amid the pandemic of the airborne coronavirus. After Florida counted virtually all its ballots the night of the presidential election, while other states still tabulated.
""We're now being looked at as the state that did it right and that other states should emulate,"" DeSantis said at the time.
But after months of complaints from Trump mail-in votes, which Biden handily won, DeSantis passed laws increasing the difficulty of that method of voting.
""He is taking a voting system that has worked without a hitch and forcing me to sign up after each election,"" Ailworth said. Anyone voting by mail must now contact their county's elections office to manually register to receive the so-called absentee ballots, rather than checking a box on the ballot envelope.
Democratic gubernatorial candidates target other issues, too
The lone Florida Democrat holding statewide elected office, Fried, is challenging DeSantis. She believes she can win disaffected Republican-leaning voters by appealing to them on values such as ""government overreach"" and taxes, she said.
""Under Trump and DeSantis, we have seen the Republican Party basically create an authoritarian regime,"" Fried said in an interview with The Palm Beach Post. ""Republicans have typically been for less government, less taxes. This Republican Party is just the opposite.""
Local municipal officials across the state are balking at DeSantis' and GOP lawmakers' in Tallahassee removing their powers, she said. Republican mayors, too, dislike the direction of the state party, although she didn't name any on the record.
Mayors criticized DeSantis last year as COVID-19 infections spiked in spring break hotspots as revelers descended upon the state and helped spread the disease in places such as Daytona Beach and Miami Beach. The governor had signed laws and executive decrees restricting or nullifying local laws meant to slow the virus' spread, such as mask requirements and social distancing rules.
Fried also criticized DeSantis in April for signing a bill into law that adds a 6% online sales tax when buying from out-of-state retailers. The revenue raised is meant first to help replenish the state's unemployment insurance fund, then help make up for revenue lost by a tax cut DeSantis passed for businesses that rent out commercial space.
The leading Democratic gubernatorial contender, Crist, knows firsthand about leaving the GOP. He was elected governor in 2006 as a member of the party, then left it in 2010 because it had become too extreme, he said, before unsuccessfully running for Senate that year as an independent. He ran unsuccessfully for governor in 2014 as a Democrat. He won a congressional race in 2016 for a St. Petersburg district and has served since.
To win those Republicans who rebuke Trump, Crist said, tell them, ""You don't have to be part of the Trump crowd anymore, like our governor, who is Trump Jr. You can have a moderate, reasonable Florida Democrat be a good governor for you.""
When he campaigned in 2014, Crist said, ""I went to Pensacola. I went to traditionally red (Republican) counties ... to talk to people. To look them in the eye."" As for policies and ideas that disaffected Republicans would like, he said, ""being fiscally responsible is one of them. Ensuring that we are not going to have an income tax in Florida means a lot to them.""
Another Democratic gubernatorial contender, state Sen. Annette Taddeo, also mentioned the GOP-led efforts to cut freedoms of businesses and schools as a way to win ""middle-of-the-road"" voters. Taddeo, along with Fried and Crist, denounced DeSantis in November for passing laws that allow the state to fine businesses and government agencies that ask visitors for proof of vaccination against COVID-19. These laws also allow employees who were fired for refusing to take the free, safe and effective shots to collect taxpayer-funded unemployment insurance benefits.
DeSantis also is expected to sign the so-called ""Stop WOKE Act,"" which critics fear will punish schools and businesses from discussing race and racial discrimination.
""If we're gonna be the freest state in the country,"" Taddeo said, referencing a DeSantis slogan, ""why are you going to impose on businesses what they can and can't do?""
Taddeo once served as chairwoman of the Miami-Dade Chamber of Commerce. ""I thought the Republican Party was the anti-lawsuit party. But all these laws passed are sue, sue, sue. It's insane,"" she said.
One Democratic former elected state official said candidates from her party could win over Republican-leaning voters by pushing against state laws DeSantis has supported that take power from local governments and strip rights from business owners.
""I know plenty of Republican city council members and school board members and county commission members all over the state who are totally frustrated by this,"" Democratic former state Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink said. She ran for governor in 2010, losing to Republican Rick Scott by less than one percentage point.
Democrats could appeal to business-minded disaffected Republicans by advocating for their freedoms in the face of the current Florida GOP.
""If I'm a small business owner and ... I decide I don't want people coming into my store to mask up and sometimes I want to, that should be my right,"" Sink said.
Does this Florida county hold a blueprint for Democrats?
To retain voters like Link and Gritters, and attract more disillusioned Republicans, one Central Florida Democratic official suggests looking to her county.
The majority of voters in Seminole County, population 472,000, north of Orlando, backed Biden in November, the first time since 1948 a Democrat won it.
Seminole County's Democratic Party chairwoman, Lynn Moira Dictor, said the county shifted towards her party because of ""socially responsible"" and ""fiscally moderate"" Republican-leaning voters and former Republicans.
Telling those voters, ""I want to make sure we are fiscally responsible"" gets their attention, Dictor said, while emphasizing, ""We're not gonna have wasteful spending.""
Dictor said said her county party tries to avoid sounding too much like U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the self-described democratic socialist from Vermont who does not affiliate as a Democrat but ran for president twice as one.
Republicans in the county outnumber Democrats by less than 2,000, a big drop from more than 13,000 in 2016.
Many college-educated white voters who used to lean Republican have become fed up with the GOP, in large part thanks to Trump, University of Central Florida political science Professor Aubrey Jewett said. ""And that is – at least in Seminole County – a big part of the explanation for why we went Democratic for the first time in, like, 50 years.""
About half of county residents earn more than $67,000 annually, or $11,000 more than Florida's household median income. And 40% of residents 25 and older have a college degree, compared to 30% statewide.
It's a similar story in Duval County, home to Jacksonville, where voters backed Biden, the first time since 1976 a Democrat carried the county.
The GOP ""may have alienated people who may have been (John) McCain-type Republicans or (Mitt) Romney-type Republicans,"" Binder at the University of North Florida said.
And when it comes to DeSantis, he said some anti-Trump Republican acquaintances liked the governor at first.
""I think the COVID-denying aspect of him hurt him among those folks, the pro-science people,"" Binder said. ""They're looking and they're saying, 'Geez this guy's dangerous.'""
Link, the former Republican, has the same view of the governor. ""I've got a friend who calls him 'DeathSantis' and I agree with that,"" she said. ""He's really Trumpy. I truly do not like DeSantis and would never vote for him.""",How Florida Democrats plan to win disaffected Republicans
262,"DEERFIELD BEACH, Fla., July 30, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Medify Air is excited to offer discounts and financing for schools and businesses looking to buy air HEPA air purifiers in bulk ahead of the coming academic year. A third pandemic stimulus bill called the American Rescue Plan (ARP) was signed into law in March 2021, providing public school districts across the country $122 billion in Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief (or ESSER III) funds. An additional $2.75 billion was allotted for non-public schools as Emergency Assistance to Non-Public Schools (or EANS) funds.
As educators begin to shift back to full-time, in-person instruction this fall, they will be able to assess the extent of their students' learning loss and determine which interventions are best. Until then, creating a safe environment for learning is paramount.
Medify Air purifiers are equipped with HEPA H13 filters, which remove 99.9% of airborne particles down to 0.1 microns in size - that is smaller than the size of a COVID virus particle. Medify offers discounts and financing for schools and businesses looking to buy in bulk.
ESSER III and EANS funds are intended to help schools reopen quickly and safely and address significant learning loss by U.S. students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Schools can use ESSER III and EANS funds to remediate learning loss in several ways, including:Purchasing health and safety equipment to help prevent the spread of diseases, such as high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers, sanitation stations, and universal cleaners. Furniture and equipment to keep teachers, students, and staff safe and/or distanced during in-person instruction, such as individual desks and mobile chairs, tabletop screens, and personal protective equipment (PPE). The hiring of additional personnel to keep school spaces safe and clean, such as nurses and custodians. Purchasing outdoor furniture and equipment to account for an increase in outdoor activities and dining, such as picnic tables, benches, and portable sinks. Hiring additional educators and support staff. Investing in educational technology and remote learning tools, including hardware, software, and connectivity to support student learning.These are just a few ways schools can use ESSER III and EANS funds.

263,"The final version of a bill spending billions in federal aid was revealed late Wednesday, long after dark. By Thursday morning, the $4 billion package emerged in a nearly empty chamber of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where it was approved without an audible “yea"" or “nay."" Four minutes later, the session was over.The moves ushered the long-sought bill to the Senate and inched it closer to the governor's desk — but with no formal remarks, just six of 159 representatives on hand, and the public still physically locked out of the building.The sweeping spending legislation promises hundreds of millions of dollars for everything from housing to workforce training to Massachusetts' health care system. It also offers the potential of transformational change for industries and communities walloped by the COVID-19 pandemic, lawmakers say.But for a plan with massive implications, such swift movement, like Thursday's, was by design.After missing a self-imposed deadline to reach a deal on the bill — and starting a seven-week recess on Nov. 17 — Senate and House leaders spent two weeks unknotting differing versions of the package behind closed doors, all while Governor Charlie Baker and community leaders fretted about the need to quickly reach a compromise.After they announced they did Tuesday night, the bill itself didn't formally emerge until nearly 24 hours later after legislators needed the day to smooth out its language. The bill officially made it to the House clerk's office at 7:56 p.m., on Wednesday — four minutes before a deadline for so-called conference committee reports to be able to be considered the next day.With lawmakers on recess, their calendar includes only informal sessions, where no roll calls are taken and unanimous voice votes are required, and are often done quickly, for a bill to move.So, about 15 hours after the final package had been released, it emerged shortly into a 10-minute-long House session on Thursday. The House gallery — still closed to the public with the rest of State House after 600-plus days — was empty, save for a toddler in pink overalls teetering about with a House court officer in tow. Some of the half-dozen state representatives dotting the chamber were engrossed in their smartphones.The House approved the compromise with an unrecorded voice vote and no speeches on the floor. The Senate is expected to take up the bill on Friday, when a few procedural votes in both chambers will finally usher it to Baker.While uncommon to move major legislation through an informal session, legislators said Thursday that the bill's debate-less passage isn't indicative of the process that's consumed it.For months, lawmakers touted a deliberate approach over Baker's prodding to move quickly, holding a half-dozen hearings about how to spend the $4.9 billion of once-in-a-generation federal stimulus aid on which the bill is largely built.Both the House and Senate passed their versions unanimously in full, formal sessions, using funds both from the federal American Rescue Plan Act and a $1.5 billion state surplus. Much of what the chambers passed remained in the final compromise version, lawmakers say, though it grew $180 million beyond what either chamber had initially approved. Conference committee reports are not subject to amendments.“I think people wanted to get it done quickly and not necessarily worry about discussions on the floor about it,"" state Representative Aaron Michlewitz, the House's lead negotiator on the bill, said of Thursday's session. “We brought everyone to the table who wanted to be at the table during the discussion. It's bipartisan, it has a lot of good things in there.""Even in moving the bill without the full legislative bodies present, said state Senator Michael J. Rodrigues, “I don't think anything is lost.""“If there's anything lost in the media, it's really the governor's news that is going to trump it,"" the Westport Democrat said, referring to Baker's announcement Wednesday that he won't seek reelection next year.Not all agree.Informal sessions are typically reserved for “non-controversial housekeeping items,"" argued Paul Craney, a spokesman for the conservative Massachusetts Fiscal Alliance, not to pass a multibillion-dollar spending package.And with such hulking legislation — it spans 163 pages and 3,679 lines, and includes hundreds of earmarks — advocates argue that giving the public the time to examine how the money is spent during each step of the legislative process is crucial.While the House and Senate largely agreed on what areas should receive funding, they repeatedly disagreed on how much, prompting various shifts in totals within the compromise. And even in instances where they appeared to be in agreement, such as dedicating $100 million for port work geared toward the offshore wind industry, change proved to be unavoidable. Funding on that item dropped to $90 million in the final version.“Ultimately, the only version of the bill that matters is the final version,"" said Justin Silverman, the executive director of the New England First Amendment Coalition. “And even if there was some opportunity for the public to be a part of the process, to see some of the deliberations and debate over certain amendments, all that matters now is: What is in the final bill? What made the final cut, and what didn't?""A lot did. The bill promises to pump $400 million for mental and behavioral health, in part to help recruit more workers to that field, and dedicates more than a half-billion dollars for housing, including to help spur more first-time homeownership in what is a rapidly growing state.Huge buckets of funding also will flow to local and regional public health systems, the state's hospitals, and schools to upgrade HVAC systems. Funds were set aside for bonuses of at least $500 for low-income essential workers.The package also is littered with earmarks big and small. It carves out $6.5 million to help Boston address the humanitarian crisis at intersection of Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, including $5 million for “post treatment supportive housing."" The city of Lynn will get $2.5 million to help improve the water quality at King's Beach, which on many summer days remains unsafe for swimming. Another $5 million is reserved to help pay down debt service obligations at the Edward M. Kennedy Institute.There are also line items as small as $50,000 for renovations to Townsend's town common gazebo, $100,000 “to nourish and restore"" beach dunes in Edgartown, and $125,000 to help restore a 90-year-old cemetery chapel in Wakefield.“The more resources we can pull in from the state the less we have to pass on to the citizens,"" said Connor Read, the town administrator of Easton, which is in line to receive $2 million toward a $9.2 million project to build three plants for treating the town's water for toxic “forever chemicals"" known as PFAS.“This is going to be an exceptionally expensive endeavor for all of us [in Massachusetts] in the coming decades,"" he said.The Senate ultimately opted to wait until Friday before taking up the compromise, in part to give senators “a full day to look at it,"" said Rodrigues, the chamber's top negotiator on the legislation.Rodrigues said he plans to speak about the bill on the Senate floor. He said he also intends to be brief.Matt Stout can be reached at matt.stout@globe.com. Follow him on Twitter @mattpstout.Credit: By Matt Stout GLOBE STAFF","Massive spending bill, little discourse"
264,"After federal health officials Tuesday said they are recommending a pause in the administration of the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine, Pennsylvania followed suit.
The state has notified all COVID-19 vaccine providers administering the Johnson and Johnson vaccine to pause its use until at least April 20, according to a statement from the Department of Health.
Gov. Tom Wolf and state health officials learned of the federal request for a pause at the same time as the general public. The move comes after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced they are reviewing six reported cases of a rare blood clot found in women after receiving the one-shot vaccine.
Here's what it means for Pennsylvanians:
What if I'm scheduled for a Johnson and Johnson vaccine in Pennsylvania?
Providers throughout Pennsylvania were quick to act Tuesday, although impact varied.
In Southeastern Pennsylvania, Bucks County closed its largest mass vaccination site after reports of blood clots in six individuals who received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine at locations nationwide.
Approximately 1,100 people were scheduled to receive a Johnson & Johnson vaccine at one of five county vaccination sites on Tuesday.
Neighboring Montgomery County temporarily shut down three vaccine clinics.
In Philadelphia, a number of clinics were giving out Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Locations closed or switched to another vaccine, said Dr. Thomas Farley, Philadelphia health commissioner.
""We are very concerned about this new development, and in the interest of safety, we are following the FDA's guidance and telling all of our providers to immediately stop using the Johnson & Johnson vaccine,"" Farley said.
UPMC was set to hold a drive-up clinic on Wednesday and Thursday at Pittsburgh Mills with the one-shot Johnson and Johnson vaccine.
Instead, the clinic will proceed using a supply of the Pfizer vaccine for community members with appointments.
UPMC is currently notifying those with scheduled appointments of the change.
Erie County's largest COVID-19 vaccination clinics have not received a large supply of Johnson & Johnson vaccine, so the nationwide pause will not have much of an impact, county health officials said.
""It was available mostly to the chain pharmacies and the State Correctional Institution at Albion,"" said Charlotte Berringer, R.N., director of community health services for the Erie County Department of Health. ""We have over 14,000 other doses of vaccine available, so there is still plenty of vaccine.""
SCI Albion was scheduled to receive 2,400 doses this week. Plans to vaccinate staff and inmates have been paused, said Maria Bivens, press secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections.
A nearby hospital, UPMC Northwest in Venango County, was planning to vaccinate people with Johnson & Johnson at a clinic on Friday but will provide Pfizer vaccine instead, UPMC officials said.
Community Health Net, a downtown Erie federally qualified health center, postponed a vaccination clinic for local homeless people scheduled for Wednesday due to the J&J pause. CHN officials are working with Erie homeless shelters to vaccinate people with Moderna.
UPMC did not have any J&J vaccine clinics scheduled in the central Pennsylvania region. Past and upcoming clinics are providing either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.
WellSpan Health has not administered any Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to date, a spokesperson confirmed.
""We do not anticipate any widespread operational changes in relation to the guidance issued by the CDC and FDA,"" said Stephanie Andreozzi, co-lead of WellSpan's vaccination team. ""At this time we have ample supply of other vaccine doses and are ready to expand eligibility to all Pennsylvanians 16 and older in accordance with the Governor's orders.""
What if I'm scheduled at another clinic?
Pennsylvanians scheduled to receive the Johnson and Johnson vaccine in the coming days should keep their appointments, the statement notes.
The state has access to both Pfizer and Moderna vaccines from several different avenues for the future that that commonwealth should be able to use right now to put in arms.
Several vaccination sites around the state are also making plans to continue vaccinations with either Pfizer or Moderna. But some sites may have to pause vaccinations and ""reschedule for a later date.""
""This protocol should give all Pennsylvanians confidence in the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine,"" Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said in a statement, ""and individuals should proceed with getting vaccinated as soon as possible to fight the virus, particularly as our case counts rise.""
What if I already received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine?
As of April 12, more than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.
To date only six people in the U.S. — all women between the ages of 18 and 48 — experienced the blood clots that prompted the pause. The blood clots, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration announced in a series of tweets, are severe and extremely rare.
The single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine was shown to have a 72% efficacy rate in the United States in preventing symptomatic illness and an 85% efficacy rate in preventing the most severe disease 28 days after vaccination.
People who got the one-dose J&J vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider, the FDA advised.
Health care providers are asked to report adverse events to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System: https://vaers.hhs.gov/reportevent.html.
What does this mean for Pennsylvania's vaccination effort?
It was just yesterday that Pennsylvanian announced they were opening the vaccine floodgates, allowing all individuals 16 and over to schedule appointments. The impact of the pause on Pennsylvania's vaccination effort won't be known until health officials determine just how long the pause will last.
Beam did not say whether this would affect the pace of vaccine administration as universal eligibility begins in the state Tuesday.
""We have to make sure we get the critical mass of Pennsylvanians vaccinated so, again, we can go on offense against the spread of the virus,"" Beam said.
The CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices on Wednesday to further review the six cases and assess their potential significance, and officials in Pennsylvania will wait to hear their findings.
""While this announcement is challenging, it highlights the vaccine evaluation process,"" Beam said. ""The CDC and the FDA are closely monitoring vaccines for safety and effectiveness, and if there is a cause for concern, they will take action because safety is paramount.""
The White House said that the recommended pause on the use of Johnson & Johnson's COVID-19 vaccine won't have a significant impact on the nation's vaccination plan.
""Johnson & Johnson vaccine makes up less than 5 percent of the recorded shots in arms in the United States to date,"" said Jeff Zients, coordinator of the White House's coronavirus response task force.
Zients said the U.S. has secured enough vaccine doses from Pfizer and Moderna to vaccinate 300 million Americans.
This week alone, 28 million doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines will be distributed nationally, ""more than enough"" to continue at the current pace of 3 million vaccinations a day, Zients said.
Johnson & Johnson had previously promised to deliver 100 million vaccine doses to the U.S. by the end of May.",J&amp;J vaccine paused in Pennsylvania

EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. - If you build it during a pandemic, will they still come?
American Dream put that to the test when it opened the new luxury shopping wing of its megamall in September, just across the Hudson River from Manhattan in East Rutherford, N.J., featuring Saks Fifth Avenue, Dolce & Gabbana, Hermes and other luxury stores, along with exotic fish ponds, gardens and 16-foot sculptures.
Like everything about American Dream, the timing has been less than ideal. The new wing comes as the world grapples with the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, which continues to threaten life - and business - from returning to normal.
American Dream took nearly two decades - and lots of fits and starts in between - to become a reality. When it finally did open in October 2019, the giant shopping and entertainment complex was forced to close five months later as the coronavirus bore down on the globe.
It reopened last October with new safety protocols in place. But the pandemic has complicated its outlook, delayed expansion plans, cut off its cash flow and stolen international visitors. American Dream also lost a handful of key partners that either filed for bankruptcy - like Barneys New York, Century 21and Lord & Taylor - or pulled out like high-end retailer Montcler.
The new luxury wing marks the final construction phase of American Dream's retail and entertainment offerings; it still has plans to add hotels. The luxury wing is expected to be a key highlight to the 3 million square feet of leasable space, more than half of which is dedicated to over a dozen entertainment attractions like a 16-story indoor ski slope and a waterpark. By year-end, it will have leased more than 85% of its space, according to an American Dream representative.
Ken Downing, chief creative officer of the mall's owner Triple Five Group, acknowledged a bumpy start but says he's optimistic about American Dream's future. The spring and summer months were ""very popular"" as people were looking for a safe place to shop, dine and get away, he said.
American Dream's website says it's constantly cleaning the facility. Employees are required to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status while tenants and visitors are encouraged to do the same. The company delayed full-service indoor dining until the opening of a high-end Italian restaurant in its luxury wing.
Saks Fifth Avenue, which just re-entered the New Jersey market with its store here, is focusing on making nervous shoppers comfortable.
John Antonini, director of stores for Saks Fifth Avenue, said that the pandemic forced it to be ""obsessed"" with services that offer more shopping options for people who either don't want to go to Manhattan or go to any physical store.
It's testing a service at the store where shoppers can sit in a private room with a big flat screen TV in the personal shopping area and virtually shop the latest collection at its Manhattan store with one of its style advisers. Customers looking to buy shoes but want to try them on in their home can text their style adviser and someone will arrive with an assortment for selection.
On a recent weekday, the sound of drills and presence of construction crews fixing up store interiors were a reminder that American Dream is still a work in progress. The mall had a constant stream of people, many of them masked, but it was clearly not crowded.
Cristal Fernandez, 24, from Wayne, N.J., visited American Dream for the first time during the luxury wing's opening. She said she felt safe and liked the overall experience.
""It seems like they're definitely on top of keeping things clean,"" said Fernandez, who bought a few items like cosmetics. ""People seem to be pretty good about masks and staying at a distance.""
Downing says the weekends bring 75,000 people to American Dream, which features a mix of high- and low-price retail tenants. When it first opened, American Dream said the initial goal was 45 million to 50 million visitors in the first year. Officials didn't directly address whether they met that goal. Downing says people are traveling from greater New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia area and as far as California and Florida, but that he's looking forward to international visitors, which should account for 20% of the overall base.
Triple Five, a Canada-based mall and entertainment conglomerate, took over American Dream in 2011 from two developers and reimagined it as a community hub for tourists and locals, taking a page from two other malls it had developed: West Edmonton Mall in Alberta, Canada, and Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. - the two largest malls in North America.
But the nearly seven-month closure of American Dream caused the company to default on an underlying mortgage. Meanwhile, the Mall of America has a $1.4 billion loan on its mortgage, according to Trepp, a New York-based research firm that tracks the commercial mortgage-backed securities.
The pandemic has hurt malls in general. Still, analysts say the high-end ones have been more resilient while low-end malls have suffered, with moderate-priced department store chains like J.C. Penney shuttering stores.
The average vacancy rate for all malls across the country climbed by around 2.2 percentage points from the end of 2019 to the second quarter of 2021 and now hovers at 7.4%, says CoStar Group, a real estate research firm. The top-tier malls are seeing vacancies average 4.5% as of this year's second quarter, while the bottom-tier have experienced a much greater slowdown, with an average of around 13%.
Daniel Hodges is CEO and founder of Retail Store Tours, which offers tours to retail executives at prime destinations to inform them of best retail practices. He says he's bullish on American Dream, noting a combination of entertainment and its attention to detail like a meandering design that doesn't overload shoppers, use of natural light and amenities like plenty of seating.
""It is a very stressful time for retail, especially when you are doing epic retail like American Dream but all the fundamentals are strongly entrenched,"" he said. ""This is the future of retail.""
Downing said ""the sucker punch that the pandemic gave the entire world was something none of us were expecting.""
But, he added, ""It's time to open it. And whatever the world has in front of us, we'll deal with that at that time.""",American Dream unveils luxury shopping wing
267,"The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies issued the following news release:The four leading international health and humanitarian organizations announced today the establishment of a global Ebola vaccine stockpile to ensure outbreak response.The effort to establish the stockpile was led by the International Coordinating Group (ICG) on Vaccine Provision, which includes the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), and Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF), with financial support from Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. The stockpile will allow countries, with the support of humanitarian organizations, to contain future Ebola epidemics by ensuring timely access to vaccines for populations at risk during outbreaks.The injectable single-dose Ebola vaccine (rVSV Triangle G-ZEBOV-GP, live) is manufactured by Merck, Sharp & Dohme (MSD) Corp. and developed with financial support from the US government. The European Medicines Agency licensed the Ebola vaccine in November 2019, and the vaccine is now prequalified by WHO, and licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration as well as in eight African countries.Before achieving licensure, the vaccine was administered to more than 350,000 people in Guinea and in the 2018-2020 Ebola outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo under a protocol for ""compassionate use"".The vaccine, which is recommended by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunization for use in Ebola outbreaks as part of a broader set of Ebola outbreak response tools, protects against the Zaire ebolavirus species which is most commonly known to cause outbreaks.""The COVID-19 pandemic is reminding us of the incredible power of vaccines to save lives from deadly viruses,"" said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. ""Ebola vaccines have made one of the most feared diseases on earth preventable. This new stockpile is an excellent example of solidarity, science and cooperation between international organizations and the private sector to save lives.""UNICEF manages the stockpile on behalf of the ICG which, as with stockpiles of cholera, meningitis and yellow fever vaccines, will be the decision-making body for its allocation and release.The stockpile is stored in Switzerland and ready to be shipped to countries for emergency response. The decision to allocate the vaccine will be made within 48 hours of receiving a request from a country; vaccines will be made available together with ultra-cold chain packaging by the manufacturer for shipment to countries within 48 hours of the decision. The targeted overall delivery time from the stockpile to countries is seven days.""We are proud to be part of this unprecedented effort to help bring potential Ebola outbreaks quickly under control,"" said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director. ""We know that when it comes to disease outbreaks, preparedness is key. This Ebola vaccine stockpile is a remarkable achievement - one that will allow us to deliver vaccines to those who need them the most as quickly as possible.""As Ebola outbreaks are relatively rare and unpredictable, there is no natural market for the vaccine. Vaccines are only secured through the establishment of the stockpile and are available in limited quantities. The Ebola vaccine is reserved for outbreak response to protect people at the highest risk of contracting Ebola - including healthcare and frontline workers.""This is an important milestone. Over the past decade alone we have seen Ebola devastate communities in West and Central Africa, always hitting the poorest and most vulnerable the hardest,"" said IFRC Secretary General, Jagan Chapagain. ""Through each outbreak, our volunteers have risked their lives to save lives. With this stockpile, it is my hope that the impact of this terrible disease will be dramatically reduced.""""The creation of an Ebola vaccine stockpile under the ICG is a positive step"", said Dr Natalie Roberts, Programme Manager, MSF Foundation. ""Vaccination is one of the most effective measures to respond to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases, and Ebola is no exception. An Ebola vaccine stockpile can increase transparency in the management of existing global stocks and the timely deployment of the vaccine where it's most needed, something MSF has called for during recent outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of Congo.""An initial 6,890 doses are now available for outbreak response with further quantities to be delivered into the stockpile this month and throughout 2021 and beyond. Depending on the rate of vaccine deployment, it could take 2 to 3 years to reach the SAGE-recommended level of 500,000 doses for the emergency stockpile of Ebola vaccines. WHO, UNICEF, Gavi and vaccine manufacturers are continuously assessing options to increase vaccine supply should global demand increase.[Category: Sociological]MSTRUCK-7348532 MSTRUCK","UNICEF, WHO, Red Cross and MSF Announce the Establishment of a Global Ebola Vaccine Stockpile"

WENATCHEE, Wash., Jan. 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Every 365 days, we pause, consider the year behind us, and anticipate the year ahead. As we reflect now, nothing's ever looked quite like this. And dentists continue to deal with historical shifts in healthcare with little precedent to lean on. Dental practices ground to a halt in March with mandatory restrictions on elective procedures after a strong start to the year. This historical period led to slow re-openings and loosening of some limitations, but in the most recent American Dental Association (ADA) surveys, practices on average continue to report 80% of previous patient volumes. As COVID-19 cases spike again, unprecedented disruption, anxiety, and loss leave us with uncertainty to start 2021.



The new year demands calculated adjustments that reassure patients to offset the attrition brought on by COVID-19.The ADA's Health Policy Institute (HPI) found dental care spending down 38% in 2020, and they project a 20% reduction in 2021. Dental practices need to make strategic, measured decisions soon to navigate through the remaining pandemic. The new year demands calculated adjustments that reassure and attract patients to offset the inevitable attrition brought on by COVID-19.
No one knows what the future holds. But as we study the past and evaluate trends, the following predictions stand:
PREDICTION #1: Dental practices, especially solo practices, will feel extra strain to retain patients and replace churn.
The HPI has tracked consumer sentiment on dental care for the past several months. Every two weeks, the survey connects with people who visited a dental practice in 2019 and gathers their opinion about visiting again. Results in November 2020 revealed the following: 
23% were recently active patients who have already been back to the dentist 60% are ready to go to their dentist when their next appointment arrives 5% are still seeking assurances and may need a little extra signal that it's safe before they'll return for their dentist visit 12% are waiting to get a vaccine before returning for treatmentThe dental industry blends immediate and elective care, which helps maintain a baseline level than many other industries envy. For example, nearly three times as many people report they won't resume traveling until a vaccination becomes available. But the implications still carry negative weight as 17% of patients express a hesitation to continue dental care.
Economic uncertainty may alter dental expenditures, even for patients who can afford care, however. The personal savings rate hit a record 33% as consumers stockpiled cash during the pandemic; reluctant spending will continue to shape consumer sentiment in the near-term. Practices also face patients who've lost their dental insurance benefits associated with vanishing jobs. Patients may delay dental care until their insurance situation and the general economy improves. 
Some people who lose coverage may be eligible for Medicaid. But not all states have dental benefits for adults, and 29 states offer only emergency or limited benefits. Consequently, the benefits for those who are unemployed won't equal previous employer benefits. Many practices don't accept Medicaid, so these patients may drop out of the private-pay system.
PREDICTION #2: Staffing shortfalls will continue to impact the dental industry.
The human resource impact of COVID-19 carries into dental offices. Many employees continue to manage remote schooling for their children and juggle childcare loss during working hours. Dental offices face challenges recruiting the right people to fill critical positions in every economic cycle. A strong job market fueled a simmering staffing crisis before COVID-19, but the pandemic accelerated the strain. Additionally, solo dentists' offices and DSOs rely on full-time employees who possess specific skills and certifications.
According to the ADA, hiring during 2020 for any position in practices hasn't been without stress. The majority of hiring dentists report that it's been extremely or very challenging compared to before the pandemic. Nearly 80% reported it was extremely or very challenging to recruit hygienists, and roughly 70% said the same for assistants.
An inconsistent workflow disrupted by shutdowns and restrictions presents another hurdle for dental practices to overcome. Stress-driven dental problems have increased, including TMJ and broken teeth. Emergency visits related to stress and delayed care present another challenge that may accelerate the longer the pandemic goes.
PREDICTION #3: Teledentistry will gain more traction. The telehealth revolution came into 2020 at a steady pace. Visits were up 33% before the pandemic, but they escalated as patients sought contactless communication channels. Teledentistry lowers the barrier to care, providing patients with direct access to their dentist from the comfort of their own homes without necessitating a physical visit. In a procedure-based profession, teledentistry plays a limited role. But patients can ask questions, perform some post-op visits, provide smile consultations, and review treatment plans. Practices can bill for the visit and collect reimbursement while keeping patients and staff safe.
Innovate practices began offering teleconsults to help patients during the mandatory shutdown in the spring of 2020. COVID-19 forced the accelerated adoption of teledentistry with creative solutions to patient communication. Teledentistry provides significant benefits to at-risk populations for COVID-19, including older people and those with pre-existing conditions. Plus, Over 80% of patients report high satisfaction with virtual visits in at least four recent studies. These findings bode well for the future of this trend. More dentists will adopt virtual consults as an extension of their practices in 2021, and patients and staff will discover more efficient access to care.
RECOMMENDATIONS for 2021Communicate regularly with patients.Dentists are often concerned about inundating patients with too many digital communications. But don't be afraid to over-communicate with your patients in 2021. Establish systems that identify and manage communication channels preferred by patients through texting, email, social media, chatbots, and phone calls. Make sure you build ""safety first"" language into your messaging to let your patients know about the precautions you're taking for their wellbeing. 
Offer your patients and staff convenient, touchless options. Safety and comfort remain the number one priority for your patients. Every step your team takes to ensure a safe environment improves the patient experience and your brand story. Plus, offering touchless ways to interact with your team enhances their desire to schedule appointments. Incorporate tools such as online appointment booking, paperless forms, and a pre-appointment comfort survey to help match the user experience found in other industries.
Digital tools also add efficiency and leverage your staff's time. The need has never been greater as practices juggle recruitment challenges with more patient engagement demands. Every task integrated into a digital workflow frees your team to focus on primary care. Including these vital components can add hours to your team's availability, reduce stress, and deliver first-class service. 
Attract new patients in 2021.In 2021, practices will expend more energy attracting new patients and nurturing existing relationships. Most practices will experience economic impacts in navigating the next phase of COVID-19. Address this challenge by taking action now to meet consumer psychology with smart tools. Develop a strategic plan that anticipates new obstacles and recognizes the opportunity to stand out from the crowd. 
Consumers will choose those practices that provide the safe, convenient, and genuine experience they want. Consider an all-in-one Patient Relationship Management (PRM) solution that integrates to your Practice Management Software (PMS). Keep your current patients engaged, attract new patients, and help your staff deliver service that they're proud to give.

",Legwork: Three Predictions That Impact Dentists in 2021
270,"""Today I'm proud to sign a budget that delivers for Arizonans. Each and every Arizona taxpayer, no matter their income, will experience a tax cut under our historic tax reform.""
Gov. Doug Ducey
In an ending flourish, the Arizona Legislature closed its annual session on Wednesday with a final debate on private-school vouchers, tweaking the program but rejecting plans to expand it.
As lawmakers were saying their goodbyes, Gov. Doug Ducey signed the $13 billion budget that lawmakers had labored over for the last six weeks — work which led to one of the longest sessions in recent history at 171 days.
The education bill was the last major policy piece lawmakers had to reconcile, as the Senate version called for an expansion of the voucher program, while the House excluded it.
The result was a last-minute change targeted at children who already qualify for the program to more easily apply for an empowerment scholarship account. The voucher program allows a portion of the public school dollars intended for the child to go to a scholarship account that they can use for private-school tuition, tutoring and other learning programs outside the public-school system.
The compromise calmed fears that lawmakers would push for a major expansion by adding new categories of students eligible for the program. But it did little to silence voucher opponents, who said the moves show a continued commitment by the Republican-led Legislature to expanding the program, which they say would further erode support for public schools.
Rep. Michelle Udall, R-Mesa, noted the change to House Bill 2898 will not increase the number of scholarship accounts. State records show about 10,000 students in the program today, and Udall said, ""That number would not change.""
But Democrats saw the insistence on reviving the voucher issue hours before they wrapped their session as a sign the debate will continue.
""This is what we are doing, defunding public education,"" said Sen. Jamescita Peshlakai, D-Window Rock.
The move to adjourn sine die — the Latin phrase for ""without a day"" — was punctuated by emotional comments from House Speaker Rusty Bowers, R-Mesa, who choked back tears as he described the distractions he faced in his duties while grappling with his daughter's illness and death earlier this year.
Ducey's office celebrated the session's achievements, from a $1.3 billion tax package that cuts the personal income rate for all taxpayers to increased funding for roads, water security and child care, among others.
""Today I'm proud to sign a budget that delivers for Arizonans,"" Ducey said in a released statement. ""Each and every Arizona taxpayer, no matter their income, will experience a tax cut under our historic tax reform.""
Despite fears a year ago that the COVID-19 pandemic would wreck the state's finances, Arizona's government has enjoyed a surplus estimated to range between $2 billion and $4 billion.
Ducey also touted provisions in the budget to pay off nearly $1 billion in debt and $1 billion in pension liabilities as well as $100 million for wildfire prevention, $50 million in student disability aid and $13 million to equip the department of public safety officers with body cameras.
But the spending plan also included a long list of provisions that have little to do with the budget — many of which legislators crammed in at the last minute — such as a ban on local governments adopting certain public health precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and curbing the authority of the Democratic secretary of state.
Other last-minute additions to the budget either revived separate legislation that did not have the support to pass on its own or that seemed to come out of nowhere.
The budget, for example, includes $500,000 for an investigation of social media companies after one lawmaker was banned from Twitter.
And Democrats called the budget a missed opportunity, arguing more of the surplus should have gone towards education and infrastructure rather than to tax cuts that will mostly help wealthier Arizonans.
""Arizona is a politically purple state with a $2 billion surplus,"" said House Minority Leader Reginald Bolding, D-Laveen. ""We had a once-in-a-generation opportunity to step up in a bipartisan way and make a real difference for a state hit hard by the pandemic and a state that remains plagued by chronically underfunded schools, prolonged drought, inadequate healthcare, a lack of affordable housing and mounting infrastructure needs. The Republican budget squanders that opportunity.""
Tweaks to voucher program
The 229-page education bill contained myriad changes to Arizona's school system, from restrictions on classroom lessons that delve into critical race theory to more funding for special-education classes. But on Wednesday, that was overshadowed by the renewed debate on vouchers.
An amendment from Sen. Paul Boyer, R-Glendale, removed the requirement that children who want to apply for the program and who are eligible for the free or reduced lunch program must wait until they've spent at least 45 school days in a D or F-rated school. With the change, those children don't have to attend a low-performing school; they just need to live within the boundaries of one.
Boyer, like his fellow Republicans, said the change will help children who need it the most, and criticized Democrats who said the public schools need more investment.
""When will it ever be enough to allow poor and minority students to leave schools that are failing them?"" he said, noting the $6.7 billion in the budget directed to education, as well as $5 billion in federal money — much of it one-time spending.
In the House, Udall said the changes she, Boyer and others negotiated won her over. Last week, she joined with two other Republicans to defeat the voucher expansion.
""This is a focus on helping low-income kids who live within D and F school areas,"" Udall said.
The amendment further lowers the wait time for all other eligible children (such as foster children, or the siblings of students already in the ESA program) to 45 days from the current requirement that the student must spend the first 100 days of the previous school year in a public school in order to get an ESA.
This bill changes it to a 45-day period in any year, including the current one, making it much easier for children to leave public school for the ESA program. In addition, private schools and school choice advocates could recruit children to leave public school for a publicly-funded private school in the same school year.
Beth Lewis, executive director of Save Our Schools Arizona, said she was grateful public-education supporters and the RedforEd movement was able to stave off a major voucher expansion.
But she criticized other parts of the measure.
""I think people would be surprised you can keep your rolled-over savings for four years,"" she said, referring to a provision that allows a student to spend money in their account until they graduate from college or for four years after high-school graduation.
Lewis condemned lawmakers who continue to hold up children living in poverty as the rationale for expanding the voucher program. Instead, she said, lawmakers should put more money into schools in low-income areas.
Udall said Ducey has promised to put $20 million into those very schools, using federal dollars.
Higher lawmaker pay gets OK
The last day of the legislative session came with a flurry of efforts to pass a few bills before lawmakers adjourned, even as legislators seemed unsure when — or even if — their session would ever actually end.
The House gave its final approval to raise the daily allowance for lawmakers outside Maricopa County, for example.
Currently, those lawmakers get $60 a day and that sum is cut after the 120th day of the session.
If House Bill 2053 were law today, those lawmakers would earn a daily stipend based on the per diem rates determined by the federal government's General Services Administration. For Phoenix, that amounts to $151 for lodging and $56 for meals and incidentals.
Lawmakers from outside Maricopa County backed the measure, arguing the current rate forces many of them to dip into their personal finances to cover the costs of housing and other expenses during the session.
Legislators also receive annual salaries of $24,000, but raising those salaries requires support from voters. And voters have repeatedly rejected past proposed increases.
In other action, the Senate shot down a proposal to impose stricter penalties for damaging or tampering with a monument. House Bill 2552 comes after a man doused in red paint on a monument to Confederate troops that stood outside the state Capitol (the state eventually removed the monument after years of requests that it do so).
Also on Wednesday, the Senate blocked a proposed constitutional amendment that would have required the governor to call legislators into session within 10 days of declaring a state of emergency. Backers argued the measure would give the Legislature more oversight and a chance to end a state of emergency after Ducey imposed several public health precautions last year to prevent the spread of COVID-19, rankling many Republican lawmakers.
Senate Concurrent Resolution 1003 would have required approval from voters in 2022 at the end of Ducey's last term but will not reach the ballot.
One provision of the budget leaves open the prospect that lawmakers could be back at the Capitol soon, however.
The budget establishes a committee to receive the results of the Senate-ordered review of Maricopa County ballots cast in last year's general election. Comprising the Senate Government Committee, the committee is tasked with coming up with recommendations based on the results — including calling for a special session to act on those recommendations.
It is up to Ducey, however, to decide whether to bring lawmakers back to the Capitol after what already was a lengthy regular session.

Long Island added more than 16,000 net new jobs in March, led in part by hiring in support services such as cleaning and security that could signal workers' return to offices.
The increase in jobs last month from February - a 1.4% increase - was above average for March  and reflects businesses   anticipating increased demand for their services, said Shital Patel, labor market analyst in the state Labor Department's Hicksville office.
""We are seeing some acceleration in job gains in anticipation of further loosening of restrictions and an economic recovery,"" Patel said. ""It's slightly faster than the average growth for March,"" which is a gain of 12,400 jobs. 
Gains in support service industry 
One of the  areas that saw job increases in both February and March and could point to a broader return to office spaces, Patel said, is the support services industry, which includes janitorial services, security services, property maintenance and other temporary help services.
That  sector ""saw an acceleration in hiring, adding 4,600 jobs in February and March, compared to an average of 2,100,"" Patel said. ""As businesses anticipate bringing back employees to their offices, they're going to be using more business support or administrative services."" 
Craig Weiss, president of T. Weiss Realty Corp., which owns 500,000 square feet of office space in Melville, said his firm has hired an additional staff member to help with sanitizing, and that the cleaning companies he contracts for his properties have increased their hiring.
""For the comfort of those employees who may not have been back for a whole year, if they see that 'my employer has enhanced cleaning,' it gives them peace of mind,"" Weiss said.
And while his larger business tenants have continued to keep staffing low, especially those with offices throughout the country, Weiss said many of his smaller tenants have already returned to the office.
""My parking lots are more full,"" he said. ""They're not back to pre-COVID levels, but they're slowly rising."" 
Restaurants, bars hiring 
In addition to those office support jobs, the Island also has seen an increase in hiring for restaurants and bars, Patel said. The increase over the last two months could indicate that owners are prepping for  more active, vaccinated customers.
""Food services and drinking places, which recently began to see capacity restrictions lifted, increased employment by 3,400 in February and March, more than twice the average of 1,600,"" she said.
But overall, the Island's job market remains way down from pre-COVID days.
On a year-over-year basis, the Island was down 94,900 jobs last month compared  with the same month last year. All  nine of the private industry sectors tracked by the state Labor Department were down last month compared with March 2020.
The three sectors with the largest year-over-year decline in jobs were trade, transportation and utilities - a sector that includes retail - which lost 20,200 jobs; leisure and hospitality, including restaurants and bars, down 19,900 jobs; and health care, down 18,900 CAPTION: Suffolk County One-Stop Employment Center hosts a job fair at the Lindenhurst public library recently.

Douglas County students may continue attending classes in person for the time being, but increasing rates for the coronavirus may lead to changes in instruction soon.
Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health announced Thursday that its guidance to schools would remain for another week in the yellow tier, which calls for schools to use hybrid or fully in-person classes. The color-coded guidance is meant to help county school districts navigate reopening schools and conducting activities as the pandemic continues during the school year.
However, both of Douglas County’s 14-day average number of cases and 14-day average positivity rate for the virus have risen recently. If the trend continues, it could push the health department’s recommendation back into the orange tier.
According to the health department’s data, the average number of cases has increased to 54, while the positivity rate has increased to 9.7%, which is just shy of the 10% threshold that suggests an orange tier recommendation. While an orange tier recommendation allows for schools to continue using a form of hybrid in-person learning, it also suggests “high risk” activities and athletics should be prohibited.

Locally, the positivity rates are much worse for some communities. Eudora, which currently uses a modified hybrid model that allows students to attend in-person classes four days a week, has a positivity rate of 19.1%, well above the 15% threshold for a red tier recommendation that calls for schools to use fully remote learning methods.
The school district, which returned from winter break on Tuesday, said on Dec. 31 that it would continue using its modified hybrid model until at least Friday. As of Thursday afternoon, the district has not yet announced its learning method for next week.
Meanwhile, Lecompton has a positivity rate of 11.2%, Baldwin City has a rate of 9.7% and Lawrence has a rate of 8.9%.
Lawrence follows its own gating criteria, which made its first applicable recommendation to the district on Thursday. Previously the criteria was updated, but couldn’t be used because it came right before winter break.
The district’s system collects data for five criteria related to the spread of the virus in the community and school district. That data is then put into a weighted system — giving some criteria more weight than others — to come up with an average rating, which then provides a learning method recommendation.
On Thursday, the system provided a 2.2 average rating, keeping the district in the yellow tier. District spokeswoman Julie Boyle said the district will continue using its hybrid model for two weeks, through Jan. 22, unless its system increases to the red tier next week.
The Lawrence guidance can be found on its website, usd497.org.
The health department’s school guidance can be found on its website, ldchealth.org/457/Smart-and-Safe-School-Reopening. Both are updated on Thursdays.

279,"Morgan Shaver was shocked to learn she had COVID-19 in July.
The virus made her so sick it caused acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, sending her to the hospital for five days.
Ultimately, Shaver's fiance also caught the virus. He spent several days in the hospital too.
They were not vaccinated, but Shaver, a Tipton County, Tennessee, resident thought she would be safe because she always wore a mask at work.
""It was very unexpected,"" she said.
The latest surge of the coronavirus might have caught Shaver by surprise, but medical experts say it was painfully predictable and emblematic of this stage of the pandemic.
Low vaccination rates and the rise of the more contagious delta variant of the virus combined to fuel a dramatic uptick in infections and hospitalizations this summer.
Unvaccinated people account for the vast majority of infections, hospitalizations and deaths, according to the data and medical experts. In places such as Tipton County, where about one in four residents are vaccinated against COVID-19, the problem is particularly grave.
While the vulnerability of Tipton County may be alarming, it is not unique.
One quarter or less of residents are fully vaccinated in approximately 120 counties that are home to more than 3.6 million people across nine southern states, according to a USA TODAY Network analysis of federal and state vaccination data.
Some of these counties may have some level of natural protection from prior outbreaks, but experts say it remains unclear how long-lasting or dependable that protection will be.
Vaccination rates are especially low in the southwestern corner of Arkansas where it borders with Texas, throughout much of southeastern Georgia and along the sparsely populated coast of southwest Louisiana.
Alabama and Mississippi are tied for the lowest vaccination rate in the nation – 34%.
Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey was blunt in her assessment of the state of the virus in the South.
""It's time to start blaming the unvaccinated folks, not the regular folks,"" Ivey told a group of reporters Thursday. ""It's the unvaccinated folks that are letting us down.""
Across states in the South, the least vaccinated communities are generally in more rural, conservative counties, where a combination of more limited access and far-right politics dissuaded many from getting a shot.
But even in southern cities, where vaccines have been easy to obtain for months, few communities are even half vaccinated.
'People don't understand
it until they live it'
The dominance of the delta variant cases terrifies Stephanie Ulrich, whose three young sons are not yet able to be vaccinated. Ulrich and her three boys rarely leave their Biloxi, Mississippi, home.
""I fear I will bury a child,"" Ulrich, 28, said.
As the delta variant crept into the region, Ulrich said the park near their home was the only place she felt safe. They don't visit their largely unvaccinated family.
Her 14-month-old son Wyatt tested positive for the virus in January. The illness complicated preexisting health issues and left him in critical condition.
Her 4-year-old son, Rowan Green, who has the same congenital airway defect as his brother Wyatt, is not allowed to play soccer with his friends or attend pre-kindergarten.
If Rowan got the delta variant, Ulrich said she is terrified he'd be back on a ventilator like he once was in 2018. If Wyatt were reinfected, Ulrich doesn't know if he'd make it to his second birthday.
""People don't understand it until they live it,"" she said. ""I've been that mom in the PICU at 2 a.m., watching a ventilator breathing for a child. You don't want to be that mom.""
Ulrich used TikTok to share Wyatt's story, and recently began speaking out about the delta variant and how it will affect Mississippi schools in the fall.
The comments flooded in, reflecting a deep divide.
There were supportive comments, but there also were conspiracy theories about the vaccines and people who said her son only got sick because of his preexisting conditions.
""They always say they're not going to set themselves or their children on fire to protect my child,"" she said.
Experts continue to stress
the power of vaccinations
Dr. David Aronoff, director of the division of infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said the next phase of the pandemic will be a balancing act.
He said it is important to continue to share messaging about the vaccine: It is by far the most effective tool against the virus and its variants. But, he cautioned, it is vital to present that information without negative judgement.
""Getting people safely immunized is really critically important, but we do need to be careful not to blame the state of the pandemic on any particular person or group of people,"" Aronoff said. ""Rather than pointing fingers we should be extending hands.""
Shaver, the Tipton County resident who got COVID-19 in July, said she initially didn't comprehend the point of a vaccine that wasn't 100% effective. Now her thinking has shifted.
Shaver said she wonders if the vaccine would have kept her from getting the virus, or if it would have curbed her symptoms and kept her out of the hospital.
She said she and her fiance likely will get vaccinated once they are 90 days from the date of their positive COVID tests. She encouraged others to do the same.
""If you haven't been vaccinated, I would strongly suggest going to get vaccinated,"" she said. ""For yourself and for others around you.""",Region vulnerable to delta variant
281,"It's Martin Luther King Jr. Day, we're two days from President-elect Joe Biden's Inauguration Day and here are the updates from Washington: Biden overrides Trump, says international travel restrictions will stay in place President Donald Trump began the process Monday of lifting travel bans on non-U.S. citizens from much of Europe and Brazil – but the incoming Joe Biden administration then said it would keep the restrictions in place. ""With the pandemic worsening, and more contagious variants emerging around the world, this is not the time to be lifting restrictions on international travel,"" tweeted Jen Psaki, who will be White House press secretary for Biden. Psaki spoke out shortly after Trump announced he would lift travel bans for 26 European countries, the United Kingdom, and Ireland as well as Brazil – but those restrictions are not set to expire until Jan. 26, six days after Trump leaves office on Wednesday. Given new rules that international air passengers are required to prove they have had negative COVID-19 tests, Trump said in a proclamation that ""this action is the best way to continue protecting Americans from COVID-19 while enabling travel to resume safely."" Trump said travel restrictions would remain in place for travelers from China and Iran. In announcing that Biden would keep all the restrictions in place, Psaki cited the advice of the new administration's medical team. ""In fact, we plan to strengthen public health measures around international travel in order to further mitigate the spread of COVID-19,"" Psaki said. — David Jackson and Julia Thompson NSA moves forward with installing Trump loyalist as general counsel; Democrats blast move Just days before President-elect Joe Biden takes office, the National Security Agency is moving forward with installing Michael Ellis, a Republican operative and loyalist of President Donald Trump, as the agency’s general counsel. Congressional Democrats blasted the move, accusing the Trump administration of politicizing a critical civil service position at the government’s largest spy agency. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller had ordered NSA Director Gen. Paul Nakasone to install Ellis before a 6 p.m. Saturday deadline, the Washington Post reported, after originally tapping him in November following Trump’s reelection loss. ""Mr. Ellis accepted his final job offer Saturday afternoon,” an NSA official said to USA TODAY, adding that the NSA is “moving forward with his employment."" Politico and CNN reported Ellis will begin his job Tuesday, the day before Biden’s inauguration. Ellis, former counsel to Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., a Trump ally, has worked in the White House since 2017, first as deputy legal advisor for the National Security Council and later senior director of intelligence on the NSA. He is tied to the controversy surrounding Trump’s 2019 phone call with the president of Ukraine that led to the president’s first impeachment. In testimony, Lt Col. Alexander Vindman said Ellis advised that a memo documenting the phone call be moved to a highly classified server. In a letter Sunday to Miller, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi demanded that he halt Ellis' installment. Characterizing Ellis as a recent law school graduate with “a limited resume,” Pelosi said he was chosen over more qualified candidates and was involved in “highly questionable activities that are disqualifying.” “The circumstances and timing – immediately after President Trump’s defeat in the election – of the selection of Mr. Ellis, and this eleventh-hour effort to push this placement in the last three days of this Administration are highly suspect,” Pelosi said. “Further, the efforts to install him or ‘burrow’ him into a highly sensitive intelligence position 72 hours prior to the beginning of a new Administration manifest a disturbing disregard for our national security.” House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff said the appointment is “part of the administration's effort to embed people in the civil service who are political and partisan actors who don't belong there.” “There’s no way someone like Michael Ellis should be confirmed or appointed or hired for a career civil service position,” Schiff said on CBS’ Face the Nation Sunday, “particularly if there were other applicants, which there were that were more highly rated.” — Joey Garrison Biden, Harris volunteer for MLK Day as Trump signs 3 executive orders President Donald Trump issued three executive orders Monday designed to expand gun ownership and create a yet-to-be approved ""Garden of American Heroes."" All appear to be limited. One order is designed to make it easier for judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers to obtain permits for concealed firearms by cutting ""red tape"" in the application process. Local jurisdictions determine gun regulations, and it's unclear if judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement officers face undue burdens. Another order is issued ""to protect Americans from facing unwarranted criminal punishment for unintentional violations of regulations,"" Trump wrote. Those kinds of issues, however, are largely decided by judges and appeals courts in individual cases. A third Trump order seeks to establish a new ""Garden of American Heroes,' though Congress has yet to sign off on the idea. In the order, the Trump administration listed dozens of names of Americans who could have statues in the garden. They ranged from Christopher Columbus to Kobe Bryant; jazz pioneer Louis Armstrong to poet Emily Dickinson; ""Jeopardy"" host Alex Trebek to former slave and women's rights activist Sojourner Truth; and President Franklin Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt. Also Monday, advisers said Trump is putting together a final list of pardons and commutations that could reach more than 100 names. –David Jackson Biden, Harris tout MLK service at part of healing, 'duty' Biden and his family encouraged Americans to join them in volunteer work and acts of service on MLK Day, the only federal holiday to also be designated as a day of service. “Service is a fitting way to start to heal, unite, and rebuild this country we love,” Biden encouraged in an email from the inaugural committee. Biden said his family was focused on supporting COVID-19 relief efforts. “I hope you’ll join us today on the National Day of Service and make a difference in your communities.” Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also took part in the Day of Service. “My mother taught me that service to others not only gives life purpose and meaning, it’s part of the duty each of us has as members of a community,” Harris tweeted Monday. Harris also stepped down from her Senate seat Monday ahead of her swearing in as vice president. California Secretary of State Alex Padilla is set to be sworn in as her replacement. President Donald Trump does not have any acts of service on his agenda for Monday. —Matthew Brown Biden taps Wall Street watchdogs Gary Gensler, Rohit Chopra Biden on Monday nominated two former financial regulators from President Barack Obama's administration to lead two agencies, signaling a shift to tougher oversight of the financial industry after President Donald Trump rolled back regulations. Gary Gensler, a progressive champion of Wall Street reform, is Biden’s pick as chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Biden also named Rohit Chopra director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, tapping a strong consumer advocate who worked with Sen. Elizabeth Warren to establish the agency in 2010. Gensler chaired the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 2009 to 2014, leading the Obama’s administration’s efforts to reform the derivatives market following the financial crisis. Gensler, who is also a Warren ally, is currently a professor of the Practice of Global Economics and Management at MIT’s Sloan School of Management. A former Goldman Sachs partner who transformed into an advocate of stronger regulations over big banks, Gensler served as chairman of the Maryland Financial Consumer Protection Commission from 2017 to 2019 and worked as chief financial officer for Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign and a senior advisor to Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign. Chopra, a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission appointed in 2018, was the assistant director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau when it launched under Warren’s leadership following the 2010 passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law. He led the agency’s efforts on student loans and was later named the CFPB’s student loan ombudsman. As commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, Chopra pushed for has pushed for “aggressive remedies against lawbreaking companies, especially repeat offenders,” the Biden transition team said in a statement, and increased scrutiny over large technology firms. The pick garnered immediate praise from consumer advocacy organizations. “Financial predators, watch out,” the consumer rights nonprofit Public Citizen said in a statement, adding that Chopra has “proven himself a dedicated consumer champion and passionate defender of Main Street Americans against corporate wrongdoing.” “Consumers can rest just a little bit easier knowing that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will not just be on their side, but aggressively establishing rules to stop ripoffs and enforcing the rules against financial cheats and scamsters.” —Joey Garrison What's ahead for inauguration week?

282,"NARAL Pro-Choice America issued the following statement:* * *On the 48th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Roe v. Wade, NARAL Pro-Choice America President Ilyse Hogue issued the following statement:""We celebrate the anniversary of Roe v. Wade at a pivotal moment in the fight for reproductive freedom. The landmark decision and the legal right to abortion are on the line like never before, thanks to the efforts of anti-choice state lawmakers trying to chip away at abortion access at every turn, and Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell's work to stack the courts with judges hostile to our fundamental rights.We must work to ensure that reproductive freedom is a reality for every body- no matter who they are, where they live, or how much money they make. For 48 years, Roe has been a vital part of keeping us on the path to realizing this vision for our future.The Biden-Harris administration embodies a new and welcome era of leadership--one that has committed to taking bold action to safeguard reproductive freedom and connected reproductive rights to the fight for justice and equity. As we work to undo the damage done by Trump and anti-choice politicians, we must carry the guiding principle that Roe is the floor, not the ceiling for the vision we espouse for this country. Fighting to ensure abortion remains legal is critical, but it is only the tip of the iceberg.NARAL and our more than 2.5 million members across the country will not stop fighting until every body is free to make their own decisions about pregnancy and parenting, free from political interference.""The threat to Roe v. Wade and reproductive freedom is acute. Earlier this month, the U.S. Supreme Court allowed a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) restriction forcing people to travel to a hospital, clinic, or medical office to access medication abortion care to be reinstated amid the still-raging COVID-19 pandemic.Any day, the Supreme Court could decide to review a case on Mississippi's 15-week abortion ban, which directly challenges Roe v. Wade and violates nearly 50 years of Supreme Court precedent. If Roe fell tomorrow, 24 states would likely take action to prohibit abortion outright. Ten states already have ""trigger bans"" in place, which would ban abortion immediately if Roe is overturned. If Roe is rolled back and states are able to ban abortion, the consequences would be devastating, Scenarios about punishing and interrogating pregnant people and healthcare providers aren't far fetched--they're already happening. Pregnant people across the country are already charged or prosecuted for experiencing pregnancy loss, for struggling with substance use during pregnancy, for self-managing abortion care, or even suspicion of it. Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC); those in rural areas; and those with low incomes are disproportionately the focus of these cruel overreaches.Despite the anti-choice movement's relentless efforts to overturn Roe and criminalize abortion, they are wildly out of touch with the values of the majority. Across the United States, the vast majority of people believe that abortion should be legal. Polling shows that 77% of Americans support Roe, and there is no state in the country where banning abortion is popular.[Category: Political]MSTRUCK-7361361 MSTRUCK",NARAL Pro-Choice America Releases Statement on the 48th Anniversary of Roe V.

284,"William Lee ""Bill"" Swail, the founder and personality behind Peoples Rx pharmacies, died Jan. 25 after an extended illness. He was 79.
He'll be remembered for his sense of humor, an infectious laugh, his customer service and being ahead of his time in focusing on improving whole body health, starting with the food we eat and the supplements we take.
""He was always so forward thinking,"" said daughter Janeen Swail Schloz. ""People would call him a visionary. He always seemed to know what was around the corner next.""
Swail started Peoples Rx with one location on Pack Saddle Pass in South Austin in 1980. It has grown into four stores and a compounding pharmacy for personalized medications. Peoples Rx is part pharmacy and part grocery store and deli, with a focus on health.
""I used to say, I don't know where Bill Swail ends and Peoples pharmacy begins,"" Schloz said. ""It was what he lived and breathed.""
Swail led the pharmacy until October 2017, when he was in a car accident that forced him to step away. The pharmacy will continue to be owned by the Swail family and has a board of directors to guide it.
Swail is survived by his life partner, Elvie Taylor Swail, their four children and 10 grandchildren, and his sister Marjorie Randall.
A memorial service will be held 2 p.m. Feb. 13 at Antone's, 305 E. Fifth St. It will be livestreamed.
Finding a passion for pharmacy
Being a pharmacist wasn't always what Swail wanted to do. Born Feb. 28, 1942, Swail moved to Austin from Houston to attend the University of Texas in 1960. He also joined the Air Force Reserve.
Swail loved learning. He was close to getting degrees in business administration, fine arts, science and economics. Finally, Elvie told him to pick something and stick with it. He chose to study pharmacy and later got his doctorate in pharmacy from the University of Arkansas in 1973.
The couple returned to Austin in 1974, where he worked at Ace Mart Drug Store before deciding to open his own business.
Creating Peoples Rx
The Peoples Rx he built was a family place, where employees started as teenagers and stayed, or left and came back.
""They loved him,"" Schloz said. ""But they also loved Peoples' mission. He wasn't just generous to customers; he was generous to employees and provided a family-like atmosphere.""
Swail used to have a fleet of used cars that employees could borrow if they needed one, Schloz said.
""Bill was always kind and always wanted to know if you had what you needed to be successful,"" said Deborah Fernandes, who has been with Peoples Rx as a pharmacist for 25 years. If she was working at night, he would come by and check on her to make sure she was OK.
""He was always just to me the textbook definition of an entrepreneur,"" she said, because he was always trying new things.
Swail loved supporting Austin's small businesses in his pharmacy by bringing in local products.
""Long before farm to table was a thing, he started talking about the food and how important it was,"" Fernandes said.
""He was always on the cutting edge of health and wellness. So much of what he implemented was kooky 25 years ago, but now we know that's a thing. He was well ahead of his time.""
When Fernandes travels to compounding association meetings, she said, people are curious about the Peoples Rx model of having a deli and a wellness team with nurses and nutritionists. ""It's a very unique business model, and people are amazed,"" she said.
Pharmacists have come to Peoples to train and then took that model elsewhere.
Caring for customers
Before Austin had 24-hour pharmacies, Peoples' had an emergency line that was Swail's home phone number. He would open the pharmacy at 2 a.m. if someone needed something, Schloz said.
""His philosophies of caring and listening and promoting wellness, it's so engrained in us,"" Fernandes said. ""We are here to support others in whatever capacity it is. That is truly his legacy.""
Often that has meant that if a customer couldn't afford their medication or didn't have insurance Peoples could accept, Peoples would give it to that customer for free. ""We say, 'What would Bill do?' a lot of times,"" Fernandes said. ""It's more important that that little baby have its medicine than the $50 or $60 we would have gotten. He would do that to a fault.""
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Peoples tried delivery like other pharmacies, but it didn't work for Peoples customers.
""People loved his model. They love to go in there and shop around and save up their questions for our wellness team,"" Fernandes said.
Away from the pharmacy
While Swail was building the pharmacy, he was gone from home often, and when they would go out to eat as a family, ""we had to share him with the rest of Austin,"" Schloz said. ""He was only half of the time at our table because he had to say hello to everyone.""
He loved dining at such Austin originals as Fonda San Miguel and Matt's El Rancho.
Swail also loved keeping active, from running to skiing and traveling. He also loved gardening and cooking.
He was passionate about educating people on health and healthful eating. He hosted a weekly Saturday radio program on KLBJ called ""Healthy Choices,"" and another program on KJCE ""Let's Get Healthy,"" and ""The Good News Health Show"" on KLGO.
""He loved to learn, to educate and share cutting-edge health information, and this was yet another way he did so,"" Schloz said.
Fernandes said employees will remember him for the father figure he was to them. ""We loved each other,"" she said. ""He modeled that. He was truly one of a kind.""",Peoples Rx founder leaves legacy of personalized care

287,"
New Yorkers with COVID are eligible for free home deliveries of antiviral treatments, Mayor Adams said Sunday as he touted a continued decrease in case numbers.
The city will provide same-day delivery of the Paxlovid and molnupiravir pills, officials announced at Jacobi Hospital in the Bronx.
The city's partnership with a telepharmacy called Alto makes the Big Apple ""one of the few places around the world offering same-day delivery of these vital therapies,"" said Health Commissioner Dr. Dave Chokshi.
The Food and Drug Administration approved Merck's molnupiravir and Pfizer's Paxlovid in December. Paxlovid was found to reduce the risk of hospitalization or death by 88% and Molnupiravir, 30%.
The treatments can help ""defang"" the virus, said Chokshi, explaining that they ""help stop the virus from reproducing, which reduces the amount of virus in the body and prevents symptoms from getting worse.""
He encouraged vulnerable groups like the elderly and people with weakened immune system to discuss treatment with their doctors if they test positive.
The announcement came as the city's COVID numbers have steeply declined since the highly contagious omicron variant caused a huge spike throughout the country during the holidays.
Cases are down 80% since early January, according to the mayor's office. The state has seen a comparable drop, according to Gov. Hochul's office.
""We are beating back [the] omicron variant,"" Adams said.
""All indicators are saying we're heading in the right direction,"" he continued. 
""A rapid decline in cases - they remain high but clearly, they are declining. 
""Hospitalizations are down. COVID deaths are down.""
While cases are starting to drop in the rest of the country, hospitalizations remain high and deaths are rising. 
The U.S. has seen more than 2,000 COVID deaths per day in recent days - a grim figure that is expected to keep climbing.
More than 880,000 people have died of COVID in the U.S. as of Sunday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University.
New York State saw 124 deaths on Saturday, according to Gov. Hochul's office, bringing the estimated death toll to 65,427.

290,"El Paso has a new COVID-19 online dashboard to track key information on vaccine distribution to help El Pasoans make safe decisions as the state mandate of wearing masks comes to an end Wednesday, officials said.
""If we're asking the community to make decisions, we're giving them the same data that we use,"" El Paso County Judge Ricardo Samaniego said. ""So they'll be able to make a decision individually and as a family. They can make a decision based on what they're seeing here, just like we're seeing it. So it's now very transparent.""
The COVID-19 dashboard was launched Monday at elpasostrong.org. The new dashboard was integrated with the current dashboard the city used to keep track of COVID-19 cases in the El Paso area.
The new parts of the dashboard provide information on the number of vaccines the city has been allocated, doses administered, remaining doses and the age of those who have been vaccinated.
The dashboard also provides ethnicity, gender of those vaccinated and breakdown of how many people have been vaccinated in each zip code.
The data in the dashboard is provided by the state of Texas and includes all medical centers and organizations receiving vaccines in the El Paso area.
The newly released data, which will be continuously updated, is to make sure El Pasoans know what is happening in their community, Leeser and Samaniego said.
Both said they hope the new data will help El Pasoans make the decision to continue to wear masks and follow COVID-19 safety guidelines.
""It's not time for us to let our guards down as we're continuing to vaccinate our community,"" Leeser said. ""We're all fighting. We're all in this together. We're fighting together to make sure that our citizens are all protected ... I urge all the citizens of El Paso to really start looking at this and look at why we talk about why we need to continue to wear our masks and continue to protect each other.""
Leeser said the new data is now being released because of changes the state of Texas made to information gathering when distributing the vaccine. The state did not initially require medical providers to keep track of gender, ethnicity and zip codes, but recently made it mandatory to ask for that information.
""This will be important as the community has asked for us to share this information,"" Leeser said. ""We've been working on it since January and really the state on Feb. 2 changed the requirements that people had in the box (on the registration form) they had to check for them to be able to get the vaccine. So this gave us the ability to really affect this dashboard. So we're very excited that we've been able to do this.""
Just over 150K El Pasoans have received the first vaccine dose
According to the dashboard, El Paso has received 301,620 doses of the vaccine with 240,397 administered. About 20.3% of doses had yet to be administrated as of Monday morning.
The first dose of the vaccine has been given to 150,383 people, while 90,051 people have been fully vaccinated.
El Paso County's population of people over 16 years old is about 640,180, so about 23.5% of that population has received the first dose of the vaccine and 14.1 percent have been fully vaccinated, the dashboard shows.
Women make up about 60% of those who have been vaccinated.
People between the ages of 16 to 64 with underlying conditions make up the largest group vaccinated so far with about 63%. Seniors 85 years and older make up about 5%, while those between 75 and 84 years old are about 12% of those vaccinated.
Vaccinations have been given to about 20% of people between the ages of 65 to 74, according to the dashboard.
El Paso County, which is a predominantly Hispanic population, has 78% of those vaccinated being Hispanic. White residents make up about 16%, while African Americans and Asian residents each makeup about 1% of those vaccinated. The dashboard lists ""other"" ethnicities as 4% vaccinated.
West and East El Paso zip codes have highest vaccination rates
Data provided by zip codes show some areas of El Paso have a much higher vaccination rate than others.
The highest vaccinated zip code areas are the 79912, which encompasses West El Paso, including Mesa Hills and Sunland Park areas, and 79936, which is in East El Paso around Montwood and Pebble Hills areas.
The 79912 area has 10,871 people fully vaccinated and 18,294 residents who have received the first doses, the dashboard shows. The 79936 area has 10,151 people fully vaccinated and 17,849 residents who have received the first doses.
South El Paso, Downtown, the Lower Valley, San Elizario, Fabens and Tornillo have some of the lowest vaccination rates in El Paso County.
Zip codes in South El Paso, Downtown and the Lower Valley range from as low as 727 people vaccinated to a high of about 3,000. San Elizario, Fabens and Tornillo have a range of 171 people in some zip codes to 672 residents in other zip codes in the area.
Leeser and Samaniego said the data will now allow the city and county to target the underserved areas to get more vaccines for those residents.
""It gives us the ability as a city and county to look and see if there's some areas that we need to continue to improve, because our goal is and will continue to be our goal every day is how do we continue to improve our system?,"" Leeser said. ""So now the dashboards can give us that information.""
Samaniego said the new data with help the county and their partner Project Amistad bring transportation to areas where residents might need help to go get the vaccine.
The city, along with University Medical Center of El Paso, has each been receiving more than 5,000 doses of the vaccine weekly. Officials said they are expecting 4,000 doses of the newly approved Johnson and Johnson vaccine this week.
Community members can register for the vaccine at epcovidvaccine.com or by calling 915-212-6843.

292,"FOXBOROUGH — It's looking more like a three-dog night when the underdog Patriots face the Bills Saturday in prime time in the hyperborean Buffalo suburb of Orchard Park, N.Y.The National Weather Service app seemingly drops the predicted temperature for kickoff by the hour, and on Wednesday the service was calling for a low of 2 degrees, with a chance of snow showers.Bill Belichick, who almost always has his charges practice outside, expressed faith that his players will not be deterred by whatever Mother Nature has in store for the club's first playoff game in two seasons.“I think over the course of the year we've dealt with almost everything,” the Patriots coach said. “I have a lot of confidence in our players. Through the course of their careers, they've dealt with multiple situations of all various types, so hopefully we're prepared for that.”Echoing the sentiments of his assistants and players over the last few days, Belichick said his focus is on only one thing.“I'm more worried about the Bills than the weather,” he said. “I think the Bills are what we have to focus on and that's who we have to beat. The weather is the weather.”This will be the third time the teams have met this season, with each winning at the other team's stadium. Belichick said preparing for a rubber match isn't a whole lot different from  when division teams face off for a second time.“I'd say what's a little bit different about this one is just how quickly we've played Buffalo with a couple of weeks in between each of the games,” he said. “Again, we know each other well. I'm sure there'll be wrinkles. I'm sure there'll be things that both teams will do that try to keep the other team off-balance or to give them a little bit of a different look.“I think that's just part of it, whether it's three games or you play a team twice every year for multiple years. It's kind of the same thing. Each game has its own unique circumstances and matchups. The plays won't get called against the same defenses or vice versa. We'll have to see how things play out.”For the record, the Bills practiced inside Wednesday.Practice reportPerhaps trying to conjure the good feelings generated by their last trip to Western New York, the Patriots blared “Outside (100 MPH)” by Meek Mill during Wednesday's practice.It was breezy inside Gillette Stadium, but not nearly as windy as it was during the 14-10 win the Patriots scored over the Bills Dec. 6.Belichick offered a simple explanation for why his team practiced on the turf, rather than the natural grass fields behind the stadium. “It's not frozen,” the coach said with a smile.There was a mixed bag of news from the session. New England was missing a couple of starters, cornerback Jalen Mills (reserve/COVID-19) and left tackle Isaiah Wynn (ankle/hip). In addition, linebacker Jamie Collins did not participate because of an ankle injury.Belichick didn't rule out Mills for the game, saying, “We'll see how it goes.”On the plus side, safety Kyle Dugger, who missed all of last week with a hand injury, was listed as limited, though he was not spotted during the portion of practice media were  allowed to observe. In addition, defensive tackle Christian Barmore, who was carted to the locker room late in Sunday's loss to the Dolphins, was at practice and was moving freely during stretching and individual drills. Linebacker Dont'a Hightower, who missed the Dolphins game because of a knee injury, also was on hand.In addition, defensive back Myles Bryant and offensive tackle Yodny Cajuste practiced after being reinstated from the reserve/COVID-19 list.New faces included cornerbacks Cre'Von LeBlanc and D.J. Daniel, linebacker LaRoy Reynolds, and tight end Jaylen Smith, all of whom were recently signed to the practice squad.Limited involvementIn addition to Dugger, Barmore, and Hightower, eight other players were listed as limited: center David Andrews (shoulder); running back Damien Harris (hamstring); receiver Jakobi Meyers (thigh); defensive lineman Lawrence Guy (shoulder); safety Adrian Phillips (knee); special teamers Brandon King (toe) and Cody Davis (wrist); and kicker Nick Folk (left knee) … According to an ESPN report, the Bears have requested permission to interview Patriots scouting consultant Eliot Wolf for their general manager job … When asked his feelings about the recent firings of Brian Flores (by the Dolphins) and Joe Judge (by the Giants), Belichick said he would keep any conversations he's had with his former assistants private … Recent history would suggest a close game means good news for the Patriots. Of Buffalo's 11 wins, nine were by at least 15 points. The Bills were 0-5 in games decided by 7 points or fewer.",Patriots coach Bill Belichick more concerned with the Bills than the Buffalo weather
293,"
In terms of who beat who this weekend in Eastern Pennsylvania Conference high school football, it was pretty much the status quo.
All of the teams that were supposed to win, won, some with more lopsided wins than expected and others with closer calls than expected.
A few things we know for sure:
Parkland, Northampton, and Freedom are in the District 11 tournament.
District 11's website gave those teams the coveted green shading signifying a clinched berth over the weekend.
Allentown Central Catholic, the defending 4A champion, took a giant step toward returning to the tournament with its win over Whitehall. Vikings need to win just one more game to clinch a spot and they play a one-win Pocono Mountain East team Friday.
And Whitehall, the defending 5A champ, continues to struggle with injuries at key positions that have contributed to a four-game losing streak.
The Zephyrs will make it into a subregional that will include District 2's Wyoming Valley West with a win over either Nazareth Friday or over Northampton on Oct. 29, but Whitehall might have to go on the road for its 5A semifinal.
Who else in the EPC will be playing football in Week 11?
Well, East Stroudsburg North and Pocono Mountain East have a COVID-19 related makeup game planned on Nov. 5 and that seems likely to happen since neither will qualify for districts.
But North and East don't appear to be headed to districts and neither does Bethlehem Catholic unless the Golden Hawks can upset Freedom Saturday afternoon at Bethlehem Area School District Stadium and then beat ACCHS on Oct. 29.
Allen and Dieruff also appear out, making their Oct. 30 game at J. Birney Crum Stadium the season finale for both. Liberty, losers of seven straight since beating East Stroudsburg South in Week 1, has been eliminated from playoff consideration, so the season-ender against Freedom on Oct. 30 will be the Hurricanes' Super Bowl.
Emmaus, Easton, and Nazareth are near locks to join Parkland, Freedom, and Northampton in the 6A and the final two spots will come down to a three-team Monroe County scramble between Stroudsburg, Pleasant Valley, and Pocono Mountain West, which makes Friday night's West at PV game one of the most important of Week 9.
In terms of the rankings, only minor shuffling this week after all of the top teams won.
Here's a look:
18. East Stroudsburg North Timberwolves
Record: 0-7, 0-5 EPC North.
Last week: Lost to Dieruff 47-16.
Last week's ranking: 18th.
What's next: At Allen Friday night.
Comment: The Timberwolves have lost 15 straight since a win over Pleasant Valley late in the 2019 season, but at least they are scoring points. They scored just 17 points and suffered three straight shutout losses to close out 2020 and began this season with two more shutouts, but have since scored in four of their last five games and had a season-high 16 against Dieruff.
17. Allen Canaries
Record: 0-8, 0-6 EPC North.
Last week: Lost to Stroudsburg 49-8.
Last week's ranking: 17th.
What's next: Host East Stroudsburg North Friday night.
Comment: First-year coach Mel Thomas says his young team, which has had low numbers from the start, is improving and that improvement will likely be rewarded with a first win on Friday night. It would end a 14-game losing streak. Allen's last win was a 20-7 victory over Dieruff to end the 2019 season.
16. Pocono Mountain East Cardinals
Record: 1-5, 1-4 EPC North.
Last week: Lost to Northampton 56-6.
Last week's ranking: 16th.
What's next: Host Allentown Central Catholic Friday night.
Comment: Rob Melosky, who is now a member of the CCHS Vikings coaching staff, returns to one of his former coaching perches. In 2017, the last time these two met, Melosky's Cardinals fought hard, but lost 62-43. That came one year after a 77-0 Central win over the Cardinals.
15. Dieruff Huskies
Record: 2-5, 2-3 EPC North.
Last week: Beat East Stroudsburg North 47-16.
Last week's ranking: 15th.
What's next: At Northampton Friday night.
Comment: Dieruff still has an outside shot at districts, but would need to beat unbeaten Northampton. The Huskies got four catches for 96 yards from Christopher Sell in its win over North and Eric Escobales and Mekhi Ashby combined for 115 yards on 10 carries.
14. Liberty Hurricanes
Record: 1-7, 0-6 EPC South.
Last week: Lost to Easton 26-21.
Last week's ranking: 14th.
What's next: Host Parkland Friday night.
Comment: Down 23-0 to Easton, Peyton Carson sparked a comeback by throwing two TD passes, including a 69-yarder to Karim Brice, and also ran for 48 yards and a TD. The Hurricanes, however, gave up 252 yards rushing to the Red Rovers.
13. Pleasant Valley Bears
Record: 4-3, 4-2 EPC North.
Last week: Lost to 42-0 to Freedom.
Last week's ranking: 12th.
What's next: Host Pocono Mountain West Friday.
Comment: The Bears' triple-option attacks scare a lot of head coaches and defensive coordinators, but it only produced 12 points in losses to Northampton and Freedom. The Bears were held to 125 yards in total offense vs. Freedom, 80 on the ground.
12. Stroudsburg Mounties
Record: 4-4, 3-3 EPC North.
Last week: Beat Allen 49-8.
Last week's ranking: 13th.
What's next: At East Stroudsburg South Friday.
Comment: The Mounties uncharacteristically have had an up-and-down season due in part to injury but still have their District 11 fortunes in their own hands. If they can beat either South Friday or Pleasant Valley on Oct. 29, they are in the 6A field.
11. Pocono Mountain West Panthers
Record: 4-4, 4-2 EPC North.
Last week: Lost 44-8 to East Stroudsburg South.
Last week's ranking: 11th.
What's next: At Pleasant Valley Friday.
Comment: The Panthers' four-game win streak came to a rough end as East Stroudsburg South ran for 223 yards and averaged more than 8 yards per carry. Luke DeRiggi caught a 30-yard TD pass from Isaiah Armand for the West's lone score.
10. Bethlehem Catholic Golden Hawks
Record: 2-5, 1-4 EPC South.
Last week: Lost to Parkland 35-7.
Last week's ranking: 10th.
What's next: Host Freedom at 2 p.m. Saturday.
Comment: It hasn't been the year Becahi wanted or expected. Sometimes coaching transitions take time. Still have two opportunities to get themselves a win to savor. Golden Hawks were held to just eight first downs against Parkland and were hurt by three turnovers.
9. Whitehall Zephyrs
Record: 3-4, 2-4 EPC South.
Last week: Lost to Central Catholic 21-7.
Last week's ranking: 8th.
What's next: At Nazareth Friday night.
Comment: Injuries are a part of all sports, especially football. They are to be expected. Yet, when they come in droves they are devastating. They are on the verge of ruining what was once a very promising Zephyrs season. Reduced in weapons, Damonte Foreman had to carry the load for the Whitehall offense and delivered a 152-yard rushing performance.
8. East Stroudsburg South Cavaliers
Record: 5-3, 5-1 EPC North.
Last week: Beat Pocono Mountain West 44-8.
Last week's ranking: 9th.
What's next: Host Stroudsburg Friday night.
Comment: The Cavs ran for 223 yards and passed for 194 in its win over Pocono Mountain West. QB Bobby McClosky was 9 for 16 for 194 yards and three TDs and hooked up four times for 122 yards and two scores.
7. Central Catholic Vikings
Record: 5-3, 4-3 EPC South.
Last week: Beat Whitehall 21-7.
Last week's ranking: 7th.
What's next: At Pocono Mountain East Friday.
Comment: The Vikings figured things out and got their running game going against Whitehall. Caiden Shaffer had a big night and CCHS got back to its traditional mentality of downhill running behind a forceful offensive line. Division I recruit Lavon Johnson was last year's EPC defensive player of the year and his numbers are even better this year: 64 tackles, 26 stops for loss, 7 sacks, 1 pass breakup, 3 forced fumbles.
6. Northampton Konkrete Kids
Record: 8-0, 7-0 EPC North.
Last week: Beat Pocono Mountain East 56-16.
Last week's ranking: 6th.
What's next: Host Dieruff Friday night.
Comment: Sophomore Jacob Dermott carried 9 times for 72 yards and two touchdowns against East. Cooper King was 8-for-9 passing for 201 yards and two TDs. It has been a nice ride for the K-Kids, but let's be honest. So much of how this season will be evaluated will come in Week 10 against Whitehall and in the playoffs.
5. Nazareth Blue Eagles
Record: 5-3, 3-3 EPC South.
Last week: Lost to Emmaus 35-7.
Last week's ranking: 5th.
What's next: Host Whitehall Friday night.
Comment: The concern here has nothing to do with the Nazareth football team. The concern here is this nonsense with bomb scares two weeks in a row. It would be nice to just ignore such sick behavior, but it's obviously something that can't be ignored. In this era of COVID-19, don't teams have enough distractions to contend with?
4. Easton Red Rovers
Record: 4-2, 2-2 EPC South.
Last week: Beat Liberty 26-21.
Last week's ranking: 4th.
What's next: At Emmaus Friday night.
Comment: The Red Rovers didn't have the convincing win many expected over Liberty, but the Rovers took a 23-0 halftime lead and got the job done behind Marcus Williams who ran for 159 yards on 17 carries and QB Cole Transue was 9 of 13 passing for 112 yards and two TDs.
3. Freedom Patriots
Record: 6-2, 4-2 EPC South.
Last week: Beat Pleasant Valley 42-0.
Last week's ranking: 3rd.
What's next: At Bethlehem Catholic 2 p.m. Saturday.
Comment: It was a great week for the Patriots, who got a lot of extra PR, not to mention quality equipment, from famous alum Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson. Johnson appears to be watching what's going on with this team and he has to like what he has seen during a four-game winning streak. Next up is the quest for the Christmas City crown and then it's on to districts.
2. Emmaus Green Hornets
Record: 7-1, 5-1 EPC South.
Last week: Beat Nazareth 35-7.
Last week's ranking: 2nd.
What's next: Host Easton Friday night.
Comment: No extra motivation will be needed for the Green Hornets, who were stung by last year's district loss to Easton and used that defeat as a driving force through the offseason. The story here is the Emmaus defense, which has given up just 17 points in the team's five-game winning streak and has held seven of eight opponents to seven points or less.
1. Parkland Trojans
Record: 6-1, 5-1 EPC South.
Last week: Beat Bethlehem Catholic 35-7.
Last week's ranking: 1st.
What's next: At Liberty Friday night.
Comment: The Trojans have secured a district berth and would love to secure the No. 1 seed and potentially two home games. They're doing it with outstanding defense and a run-heavy offense led by Dahlir Adams, who now has 829 yards on 172 carries. Parkland has now run the ball 270 times compared to 115 pass attempts.","Three are in districts, how many more will make it? EPC football rankings"
294,"OLYMPIA — Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on Tuesday touted his proposals to address homelessness, poverty, mental health issues and climate change, and pressed lawmakers to make it easier to build town homes and duplexes to ease the state’s dire housing shortage.
In a nod to both the COVID-19 pandemic and fears over security, Inslee delivered his annual State of the State address in a Capitol temporarily closed to the public around the time of the speech.
Inslee spoke in the Capitol building’s State Reception Room to an audience consisting only of journalists, who were spaced apart and had received negative coronavirus test results the day before. The House and Senate introduced Inslee by teleconference in a joint session — where governors before the pandemic would give the speech before lawmakers of both chambers.
In his speech, the governor thanked health workers, emergency responders and others working daily amid the pandemic, and offered his condolences to the family of Sen. Doug Ericksen, a longtime Republican lawmaker who died last month after testing positive for the virus.
And the governor urged lawmakers — who began the 60-day legislative session this week — to move forward on a host of pressing issues.
“I can encapsulate the state of our state very simply — we need action,” Inslee said.
“We can wake up every morning the next 60 days understanding we need ‘action, this day’ — which was Churchill’s first order at the beginning of World War II, but it serves to focus on the many tasks before us,” the governor added.
Last month, Inslee proposed a state supplemental budget that uses existing tax collections and federal COVID aid to add billions of spending and adds to the state’s reserve accounts without new taxes.
That proposal spends $815 million on housing and homelessness, including, more than $334 million to acquire existing property and buildings around Washington to be converted into housing and homeless shelters. The governor has estimated that part add roughly 2,460 new housing units of various types.
The governor has also proposed, among other things, dedicating $100 million per year to fund rebates for people buying electric vehicles and another $100 million to expand the use of solar energy, and $187 million to help protect salmon.
He talked up the clean energy economy being built in Washington, including “new solar farms popping up like dandelions in Eastern Washington.”
The decision to close the Capitol for the speech came at the request of Inslee’s staff, according to Tara Lee, spokesperson for Inslee.
The temporary closure comes after lawmakers and the governor last year occupied a Capitol that was closed to the public for the entire session amid the pandemic and civil unrest.
Early on, hundreds of National Guard soldiers stood sentry as last year’s legislative session began just days after the Capitol insurrection in Washington, D.C., and a protest in Olympia the same day where demonstrators breached the gates of the governor’s residence and chanted slogans on his lawn.
“No specific threats, out of caution,” Lee wrote in an email. “Our office staff requested it, not the governor.”
In his speech, Inslee returned to the insurrection and — like he did last week — called on Republicans to denounce three GOP state lawmakers who traveled to an election symposium in South Dakota that focused on debunked conspiracy theories.
In a regularly-scheduled news availability later in the day, several Republican leaders repeated again that they believe in and accepted that the election results — which in Washington were overseen by a GOP secretary of state — were valid.
“I believe in elections so much that I think that if politicians are caught lying, elections are the right way to deal with them,” said House Minority Leader J.T. Wilcox, R-Yelm.
Democratic lawmakers this session are expected to explore changes to some of the new policing laws passed last year, and fixes to Washington’s long-term care program. They are also expected to address funding for transportation projects and salmon recovery, and continuing the coronavirus response.
Sen. David Frockt, D-Seattle, praised Inslee’s speech, saying the governor has long made persuasive arguments on the need to confront climate change.
Meanwhile, “I definitely welcomed his emphasis on housing and homelessness, in particular, the money for rapid housing,” added Frockt.
Republicans, who are in the minority in the Legislature and have felt shut out of the COVID response, have called again for changes to the broad executive powers that Inslee has used to issue emergency orders in response to the pandemic.
The governor, who has weathered such complaints for well over a year, in his speech pointed out that the Legislature chimed last session to extend 26 emergency orders.
Immediately after Inslee spoke Tuesday, state Sen. Chris Gildon gave the official Republican response, and called again for limiting a governor’s emergency powers. Gildon, a Republican from Puyallup, said, “It’s well past time to move away from emergency rule.”
“We need to return to the rule of law, where each of our three branches of government fulfill their constitutional mandate to serve as a check and a balance on the other,” he added.
As lawmakers sprint through committee hearings in the coming days, they’ll see another new face. The Whatcom County Commission Tuesday appointed Simon Sefzik to fill the vacancy created by the death of Ericksen in the 42nd District.
At 22 years old, Sefzik, will be the youngest lawmaker in the Senate. A graduate of Patrick Henry College in Virginia, according to a news release, Sefzik has held internships at the U.S. House of Representatives and the White House Coronavirus Task Force and worked for a time as a White House staffer.",Gov.

ON MARCH 13, 2020, Ben Wachstein, president of the Delaware Valley Association of Synagogue Administrators, thought that the impending COVID-19 lockdown would last two weeks, and that area synagogues would resume normal activity by April.
The following week, Wachstein, along with the other DVASA members, realized that things weren't going to be that easy.
Over the past 15 months, DVASA, a group of a dozen-or-so synagogue administrators across the region, went from meeting sporadically to Zooming weekly, sometimes more, trading tips and tricks on how to stay afloat during the pandemic - and forging deep connections with each other along the way.







* A recent DVASA Zoom meeting


At first, DVASA members were emailing each other ceaselessly, trying to make sense of the rapidly changing climate. Wachstein made the snap judgment to host weekly Zoom calls instead as a way of exchanging information and supplies more efficiently: Where were people getting hand sanitizer? Disinfectant wipes? Were they supposed to be wearing masks?
Wachstein feared for his employees safely.
Brian Rissinger, executive director at Reform Congregation Keneseth Israel and a DVASA member for 34 years, was challenged with laying off dozens of staff members.
Most shuls had to confront the operation of preschools. Many closed over the course of the pandemic and, when some reopened, administrators were tasked with designing procedures to keep both the children and staff safe.
DVASA's direction quickly pivoted when shuls began to close indefinitely.
According to Wachstein, 20-30% of American synagogues were expected to shutter during the pandemic.
Few administrators knew how to apply for federal Payroll Protection Program loans and feared the worst for their synagogues. One member gave the others a crash course in applying for the loans, another taught them how to receive Hie Employee Retention Tax Credit. Wachstein said the synagogues saved thousands of dollars because of it.
Rissinger explained that because there isn't a specific training regiment for administrators, some have backgrounds in business and facilities management, and others in social work or past leadership in their congregation.
""As a group, we are incredibly willing to share our experiences and information,âeuro Rissinger said. ""There's nothing gained by being tight-lipped.âeuro
Beyond career credentials, DVASA members represent a diversity of Jewish backgrounds. While national organizations such as the National American Association of Synagogue Executives and National Association of Temple Executives serve Conservative and Reform administrators, respectively, DVASA spans across denominations.
""We haven't heard of any other local group developing and holding force to provide this type of camaraderie,"" said Robin Minkoff, executive director of Beth Sholom Synagogue in Elkins Park. She has been a DVASA member for more than two years, the entirety of her tenure at Beth Sholom.
Jill Cooper, DVASA's past president and executive director of Beth David Reform Congregation in Gladwyne for the past 14 years, believes that it's DVASA's commitment and connection to one another that sets them apart.
""We hold each other up, and we laugh, and we kibitz and we make fun of each other,"" Cooper said.
Working up to 80 hours a week, Wachstein, who until recently was the executive director of Temple Siani in Dresher before moving to Baltimore, was exhausted. One day, he remembers being too tired to speak. By the end of the day, he had received texts, calls and emails from DVASA members, all saying they were there if he needed them.
""I don't think any of us would have gotten through any of this without each other,"" Cooper said.
After running a synagogue with closed doors for so long, Wachstein, with the help of DVASA, is finally figuring out how to open them.
Last week, congregants at Beth El Congregation of Baltimore, the synagogue at which Wachstein is newly executive director, were able to attend in-person Friday night Shabbat services without having to preregister to attend. There were more than 100 attendees, and Wachstein swore he ""could see smiles almost through their masks.""
Wachstein can breathe another sigh of relief. Between the two synagogues he worked for over the course of the pandemic, there were no workplace transmissions of COVID-19.
At this point, as administrators are busy planning high holiday services - online, in-person and hybrid - for this coming September, DVASA still holds meetings weekly over Zoom.
But Cooper hopes that doesn't continue for too long: She'd rather have the next meeting in person. *

",Synagogue Admins Built Community During COVID
297,"They came from across South Florida, law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, proving again there are times when the uniform knows no city boundaries.
They joined family and friends at the FLA Live Arena in paying final respects to slain Hollywood Police Officer Yandy Chirino, whose body lay in a coffin draped with an American flag.
Yandy was more than an officer, said Hollywood Police Chief Chris OBrien, addressing a crowd that included Chirinos parents, family and girlfriend. He was a true hero. He sacrificed his life protecting our community. He described Chirino as easy to befriend, dedicated to his duty, and passionate about protecting his community.
Officials estimated at least 2,000 mourners attended, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody, and U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, along with Hollywood Mayor Josh Levy and other city officials.
You can shed tears because he is gone, or you can smile because he lived, said Pastor David Rosa, leading the bilingual service for Chirino, a Cuban immigrant who became a U.S. citizen at age 10. You can do what he would want: Smile, open your eyes, love and go on.
His friends echoed the tributes.
I love you, brother, said his best friend and fellow officer Henry Martinez, who was there the night Chirino died. I know you got our six.
In police jargon, to have someones six is to be their protector, keeping an eye for danger coming from the back.
He knew there was a risk putting on that uniform every night, said Chirinos girlfriend, Chelsea Howell, who praised his devotion to his family.
Earlier, officers walked somberly past Chirinos bright blue Jeep Wrangler and Hollywood Police Department vehicle in a silence that was almost palpable.
Projected on screens on either side of the stage: photos and videos from the life that was lost  -  the 28-year-old officer flashing smiles and celebrating birthdays, weddings, beach days, pool days and amusement park rides with friends and family, many of whom were in the arena, still processing the fact that hes gone.
Chirino had just begun his shift on Oct. 17 when he was called to the Emerald Hills neighborhood after a resident called to say there was a young man or teen riding around on a bicycle trying to open car doors.
Within 30 minutes of the call, Chirino was shot in the face.
That night, as I ran to you, Martinez said Monday, I could not believe that the life of the party was not responding to my cries.
Martinez described arriving at the emergency room at Memorial Regional hospital, encouraging his friend that help was close.
Chirino died at 1 a.m. on Oct. 18. He was 28.
Police arrested 18-year-old Jason Banegas of Miami. The teen has a criminal history that goes back to when he was 12. At the time of his first-degree murder arrest, Banegas had only been out of lock-up for juveniles for some 30 days.
Court records say Chirino was trying to get control of Banegas gun when he was shot in the face. Banegas told police he meant to turn the gun on himself and not the police officer. The gun had been reported stolen out of Miami-Dade County a month earlier. Banegas 16-year-old sister was arrested for the stealing the gun. Like her brother, she too has a record that dates back several years.
Chirino was born in Cuba and came too the United States when he was a young child. He was naturalized at age 10. He excelled in sports and was a natural leader among his teammates. He joined the Hollywood Police Department four years ago.
Chirinos death is the first line of duty death for the Hollywood Police Department, not related to COVID-19, since 2008 when police officer Alex Del Rio died after an automobile crash. Also killed in the line-of-duty for the Hollywood Police Department was officer Frankie Mae Shivers, in 1982 of gunfire; officer Byron William Riley in 1973 after a vehicle pursuit; officer Phillip Carl Yourman in 1973 after a vehicle pursuit; officer Henry T. Minard in 1972 of gunfire; officer Owen Coleman in 1926 of gunfire. In 1997 K9 Kimbo was also killed by gunfire.
On Sunday, over 100 police officers, family members and friends gathered at the Vista Memorial Gardens and Funeral Home to pay personal respects to the family.
Attending were police and other first responders from multiple agencies, including Hollywood Police, Hollywood Fire Rescue, Florida Highway Patrol, Miami Police, Brevard and Palm Beach County Sheriffs Offices, New York Police Department and others.
A U.S. flag was flown out front of the funeral home at half staff.
Weve all dealt with the loss of life of [law enforcement officers] down here, said Lee Milstein, president of the South Florida chapter of the Blue Knights, a motorcycle club, which comprises former law enforcement officers.
Hopefully the situation with whats going on will get better and hopefully we dont have to do this too many more times. Its really difficult, he said at the viewing Sunday.
New York Police Department Sgt. John Macfarlane is a member of Brotherhood of the Fallen, an organization that flies police officers to the funerals of fallen officers around the country.
Theres a brotherhood, not only locally, but around the country thats there, giving support to families of law enforcement officers, Macfarlane said Sunday.

300,"Hundreds of Mississippi students tested positive for the coronavirus last week and more than 4,000 students and hundreds of teachers and staff were quarantined after possible exposure to COVID-19.
The flood of positive cases is forcing schools to move to virtual learning again, including six public schools in Lamar County, which had the largest number of infected students the week of from Aug. 2-6.
In what was the kickoff week of the 2021-22 school year for many districts, students in 38 of 43 counties reporting data to the Mississippi State Department of Health tested positive for COVID-19.
Students were quarantined in 41 of those counties, the data shows. There are 82 counties in the state.
Between Aug. 2 and Aug. 6, 943 students and 296 teachers and staff tested positive for COVID-19. There were 69 coronavirus outbreaks since the start of the month, according to the data.
While a handful of Mississippi-based health organizations — the American Academy of Pediatrics Mississippi Chapter, the Mississippi State Medical Association and the Mississippi State Department of Health — have endorsed universal mask-wearing for K-12 students and staff, there is no statewide mask mandate for schools. Instead, districts are left to decide whether students, teachers and staff will have mask-wearing requirements.
According to the health department's K-12 schools guidance, quarantine requirements vary depending on symptoms and vaccination status. The following options apply:
Students, teachers and staff who are not fully vaccinated and are identified as a close contact to someone who tests positive for the coronavirus should quarantine for 14 days.
10-day option: Quarantine can end after 10 days if the close contact has no symptoms during the 10-day period.
Seven-day plus test option: If the person has no symptoms for seven days and has a negative COVID-19 test collected on Day 5, 6, or 7 of the quarantine period, the quarantine period can be discontinued quarantine after seven days.
Fully vaccinated students, teachers and staff do not require quarantine after contact with an infected person.

301,"The Illinois Gaming Board gave preliminary approval Thursday afternoon to a proposed Hard Rock casino in Rockford, despite the agencys ongoing investigation into the lead developers other gambling interests in the state.
In a unanimous vote affirming the preliminary suitability of both the project and its backers, gambling regulators did not mention their probe into developer Dan Fischers 2018 purchase of a chain of video gambling cafes that investigators previously have said raised significant concerns.
Without elaborating, Gaming Board Chairman Charles Schmadeke did raise concerns before the vote, saying he had questions about current and former relationships among some of the investors involved in the Rockford project. The concerns, however, did not rise to the level of halting the project without more information, he added.
Frankly, I have some questions, Schmadeke said. But these are questions and not evidence.
Gaming Board officials declined to comment further on Schmadekes remarks. During the meeting, Gaming Board Administrator Marcus Fruchter said evaluations of the participants suitability are ongoing. If investigators find problems, investors could be forced out. Hard Rock officials said in that event their company would step in and take over the partnership stakes in question.
Fischers company, Illinois Cafe and Service Co., which operates the Dottys chain of video poker cafes, purchased Laredo Hospitality Ventures, the parent company of the Stellas and Shelbys chains in a deal that concerned gambling regulators. The Tribune detailed the questions surrounding the transaction in a story published Wednesday.
Under the deal, Fischers company put up $2 million to buy Laredos 57 gambling locations, while a slot machine supplier who works exclusively with Fischers cafes put $44 million into the deal, in payments characterized as an equity stake and noncompete clause buyout for Laredos chief executive. Gambling regulators said in internal reports at the time that the transaction appeared to be a scheme to place Laredos cafes under the control of the slot machine supplier, Midwest SRO.
In Illinois, it is illegal for a slot machine supplier to own a gambling cafe. It is also illegal for a slot machine supplier to offer inducements to cafe owners to lease their machines. The Gaming Board revealed in a court filing last summer that they are investigating the deal.
A Fischer spokesman said in a statement that we look forward to meeting with the staff to address any questions in the days and weeks ahead.
Before the vote, a letter of support from Rockford city officials for the project, which is incorporated under the name 815 Entertainment LLC, was read into the record. Hard Rock International issued a statement lauding the vote immediately after the brief meeting.
We are grateful to the state and the Illinois Gaming Board for their support and for allowing this process to get one step closer to reality. We have a lot of work to do to complete this process, and we are excited at what lies ahead, as we know the city of Rockford is as well with respect to the jobs and revenues this project will create, Hard Rocks chief operating officer, Jon Lucas, said in a statement.
The states push to welcome new casino licenses to an industry already crowded with existing riverboat casinos and thousands of video poker outlets has been hindered over the last year by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Hard Rock project, which would occupy a former hotel site along Interstate 90 where tens of thousands of cars headed to and from Wisconsin pass by every day, is the first venue to move forward in the Gaming Board approval process since the expansion bill was passed in 2019.
The casino is planned for the former site of the Clock Tower Resort, a sprawling hotel that was a regional landmark in northern Illinois for decades. In addition to a 64,000-square-foot casino, the new project plans a hotel and 1,600-seat music venue. The local partners attached to the project include Rick Nielsen, guitarist for the rock band Cheap Trick, which hailed from Rockford and was one of the most successful groups of the late 1970s and early 1980s.

303,"
CASTELLINA IN CHIANTI, Italy - For decades, the rolling hills of Chianti in Tuscany have been a holiday destination for tourists from all over the world. Nearly year-round, visitors take on the region's winding roads in their rental cars, admiring the landscape laboriously sculpted by farmers, where vineyards blend into olive groves, and forests of oak trees give way to cypress-lined drives.
For me, this is home.
More than 114,000 tourists passed through my village in 2019, and the number was even higher in previous years.
But the pandemic - which has unsettled the globe and taken more than 75,600 lives in Italy alone - has brought tourism to a halt across the country and in my village, Castellina in Chianti, a hamlet of 2,800. Foreigners, who usually would be sipping espressos on the local bar's terrace or grocery shopping at the farmers market, are nowhere to be seen. And without them, the town seems to have slid back in time.
Decades ago, villagers needing medical advice, paperwork for health services and even some routine procedures such as blood tests often turned to the local pharmacy, which sits on the ruins of the town's late Medieval gateway, just across from the church. Over time, though, national policies required the town's health office to expand its services, so people went there instead.
But local authorities closed the health office in March because of the coronavirus, and residents again found themselves relying on the pharmacy for basic health care and routine tests.
""People came to us like they used to decades ago,"" said Alessio Berti, 68, who has run the pharmacy for the past 46 years.
In the first wave of the pandemic last spring, villagers lined up in front of the pharmacy every day to hunt for vitamin supplements and face masks, he said. The four pharmacists - all members of the same family - worked long shifts and spent hours at the computer trying to help residents with paperwork. The shop became a communal clinic, the access point to online health services and an impromptu emergency room.
""They are well organized,"" said Sonia Baldesi, a 67-year-old retiree who joked that she was old enough to remember when Berti started working as the town's pharmacist. ""They offer small services that allow us to skip a trip to Siena, and that's not a small thing these days.""
It's a personal touch that is characteristic of the town. Masked, people greet each other on Castellina's street, even if they aren't sure to whom they are speaking.
""Residents all know each other and help each other if they can,"" said Roberto Barbieri, 52, who manages the village's Coop supermarket.
Castellina was not hit hard by the coronavirus in the spring, but clusters emerged in town by the fall. The virus was the topic of conversation on the street or at the supermarket, as relatives of people who tested positive hoped their loved ones would be spared.
So far, only one Castellina resident has died from the coronavirus, in November.
""This time, it's close to home,"" said Claire Cappelletti, the 62-year-old co-owner of a leather goods store in town that has been in her husband's family for more than a century.
Like other business owners who depend on the tourist season, the Cappellettis have had a disastrous year. 
When the nationwide lockdown was imposed in March, they were preparing for the start of the tourism season. But until restrictions were loosened in June, they could not sell a single item - from a handmade leather bag to colorful loafers.
They installed hand sanitizers and kept the wooden shop doors wide-open for better ventilation, but the first few Europeans who ventured to Castellina did not arrive until late July. The usual throng of Canadians, Americans and Australians never showed up.
Many tourists and some locals, however, were pleasantly surprised to find the village free of crowds. The summer was reminiscent of the late 1990s, before the buses loaded with tourists started arriving in Chianti.
""It was like it used to be, like stepping back in time,"" Cappelletti said.
Nostalgia, though, is not good for sales. Cappelletti said her shop's revenues were down 80% since the pandemic started, a figure mirrored throughout the village. But by working round the clock, and keeping expenses low, the family has kept the business afloat.
They also opened an online store. Their usual clients - some longtime Chianti visitors - started ordering goods from across the ocean, some just to help the Cappellettis.
""We now have great-grandchildren of our first customers,"" said Claire's daughter, Nicole Cappelletti, 32. ""Our customer base saved us.""
For others in the village, the year was not so terrible.
""We were shut for a good part of the year, but when the restaurant opened, Italians and some foreigners who own property here came and did not skimp on food or wine,"" said Giuseppe Stiaccini, co-owner of the town's oldest restaurant, La Torre. It opened in 1922 and served as a cafeteria for Allied troops during World War II.
Some locals - exasperated by the town's slow internet service as they tried to work remotely - hope that is one good thing that the pandemic will bring: faster Wi-Fi.
Recently, workers were digging a hole on the provincial road crossing the town where eventually fiber-optic cables for faster connections will be buried. A crowd of residents gathered to watch - with hope.
""Maybe we'll jump into the 20th century soon,"" an 87-year old resident joked.

304,"In March 2020, Delta pilot Chris Dennis left a note in the aircraft he was parking in a storage lot in Victorville, California, thinking it would be found after a two-week quarantine. But after being discovered 435 days later, the note is now being called a ""time capsule.""  Dennis said he parked the aircraft with dozens of other planes and said each represented hundreds of jobs. He described the scene as ""Chilling, apocalyptic, surreal"" in a Facebook post in March 2020. Airlines were parking passenger planes en masse as travel fell to historic lows. Dennis wanted to commemorate his emotions in a note for the next pilot to find. ""Hey pilots - It's March 23rd and we just arrived from MSP,"" Dennis wrote in the note. ""Very chilling to see so much of our fleet here in the desert. If you are here to pick it up then the light must be at the end of the tunnel. Amazing how fast it changed. Have a safe flight bringing it out of storage!"" At the time, the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning. In the year that followed, life was put on largely on pause.  Log into Facebook The pilot who found the note was First Officer Nick Perez on June 1. He said he was instantly taken back to the memories of how different world was in the pandemic's early days. Airlines in March 2020: American, Delta plan additional flight cuts for May amid coronavirus pandemic New rules: Delta Air Lines will require COVID-19 vaccine for new hires Last March, Delta Air Lines announced flight cuts because of the pandemic, and in October the airline reported a $5.4 billion quarterly loss. Perez said many pilots and workers assumed they'd lose their jobs.  ""He had to have been thinking he was leaving his job,"" Perez said in a Delta press release. ""Back in March, I was 100% certain I was going to lose my job."" Now, as millions of Americans are receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and restrictions are lifting, Perez reflected on the note and just how much has changed. On Friday, for the first time since the pandemic, the Transportation Security Administration screened more than 2 million people, marking a victory for the industry.  “I kept thinking about my mindset now compared to his when he left this note,” Perez said. “We were getting good at landing empty airplanes; now we’re going in the right direction. I’m in good spirits. I’m very optimistic.” Follow Gabriela Miranda on Twitter: @itsgabbymiranda This article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Delta pilot finds note marking 'apocalyptic, surreal' pandemic moment.

Nafissa Cisse Egbuonye
Public health director in Black Hawk County
An Iowa county that had one of the nation's highest coronavirus infection rates at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic plans to offer incentives to residents hesitant to get vaccinated.
Black Hawk County's board of health signed off Wednesday on tapping $10,000 from a private foundation to encourage more residents to get the shots, likely making it the first community in Iowa to offer vaccination incentives.
""We've hit a wall with vaccination rates. It's going much slower than we'd like,"" said Nafissa Cisse Egbuonye, public health director in Black Hawk County, core of the Waterloo-Cedar Rapids metro area, one of the state's largest. ""And we're trying to be as creative as possible.""
About half of the county's population 16 and older has been fully vaccinated, but the county would like to reach 80%.
Nationally, 39% of Americans 12 and older — and 43% of Iowans — are fully vaccinated.
Egbuonye said her team has watched the success some states have had in offering perks for pokes. Ohio has grabbed national attention by entering vaccine recipients in a $1 million lottery and, for those who are students, a drawing for scholarship, efforts credited with increasing vaccination rates there by 55% among residents ages 20-49.
Other states, as well as cities and companies, also are providing freebies to the newly vaccinated, from lottery tickets to marijuana, beer and concerts. United Airlines this week offered a chance at free flights for vaccinated customers.
And employers are offering workers time off — and sometimes extra cash — for COVID shots.
Black Hawk County is weighing offering gift cards and possibly some type of a lottery. Egbuonye hopes to roll out an incentives program by mid-June.
She would like to see the state provide vaccine incentives through its own program and by helping counties set them up. Black Hawk County plans to use money from the Otto Schoitz Foundation, a local nonprofit that also has provided financing for outreach to immigrant workers and families.
Kevin Grieme, director of the Siouxland District Health Department in Sioux City, said other Iowa public health officials are weighing perks, especially as counties find themselves returning vaccines for which there aren't enough takers.
But none have taken action he's aware of, said Grieme, whose county, Woodbury, has considered incentives. ""Other counties have mentioned it and are batting around the idea. But I don't know what the incentives would be,""
The Iowa Department of Public Health said all counties but Calhoun told the state this week they wouldn't need part or all of their vaccine allocation.
Egbuonye said Black Hawk has returned COVID-19 vaccine as its struggles to get people to accept inoculations.
Health officials are offering evening and walk-in clinics and mobile vaccinations, including at farmers' markets, and are trying to piggy-back shots with other health care visits.
Still, vaccination rates have plateaued, and are low by comparison to the nation for those ages 18 to 24.
In Black Hawk County, home of the University of Northern Iowa, the board of health approved spending $10,000 to join Story County, home of Iowa State University, Johnson County, with the University of Iowa, and Polk County, with colleges including the state's largest private one, Drake University, in a vaccine advertising campaign targeting college-age Iowans.
Grieme, an Iowa State Association of Counties board member representing county public health agencies, said people might not feel the urgency to get vaccinated with fewer people testing positive, going into the hospital or dying from COVID-19.
""We're still getting new cases, but nowhere near a year ago,"" he said.
Gov. Kim Reynolds lifted a limited state mask mandate in February. And last week she signed a bill approved by the Iowa Legislature that bans schools from requiring masks.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said two weeks ago that fully vaccinated people no longer need to wear a mask or to maintain safe social distance when in the presence of other vaccinated adults, except where governments, businesses or employers require it.
Last year, Black Hawk County was in the national spotlight as it struggled with one of the nation's largest COVID-19 outbreaks. Tyson Foods, which has the nation's largest pork processing plant in Waterloo, shut down for two weeks after roughly 1,000 workers tested positive for COVID-19. The plant employs about 2,800 workers.
The Arkansas-based meatpacking giant said roughly 44,000 employees across the country had been vaccinated, including about a third of the Waterloo workers. Tyson is giving employees up to four hours of pay if they're inoculated outside the workplace.
Egbuonye said the county is working to prevent another COVID-19 outbreak.
""It's been a pretty hard 15 months, and we're really pushing to get people vaccinated,"" she said.
""We want to ensure that people are protecting their health, they're protecting their neighbors and their friends,"" she said.
""It's been a pretty hard 15 months, and we're really pushing to get people vaccinated. We want to ensure that people are protecting their health, they're protecting their neighbors and their friends.""

311,"No Seth Jones and Jake McCabe?
No problem.
Despite playing without two of their top defensemen, the Blackhawks buckled down and beat Columbus 4-2 on Tuesday to salvage a road trip that started with a disappointing loss in Arizona.
It got a bit scary at the end for the Hawks as Columbus scored short-handed with 1:21 remaining, but Alex DeBrincat scored his second goal of the game into an empty net to ice the victory. Calvin de Haan (1) and Connor Murphy (3) also scored, and Marc-Andre Fleury made 24 saves in net.
Jones, who spent 5 1/2 seasons in Columbus before being traded to the Hawks, was placed in COVID protocol. Joining him were McCabe, trainer Mike Gapski and head equipment manager Troy Parchman.
""Pretty good road win for us,"" said interim coach Derek King. ""Had some new bodies in the lineup, new ‘D’ core. Different guys stepped up tonight and solid effort.""
Murphy (24:22 time on ice) and de Haan (21:14) teamed up on the No. 1 ‘D’ pair and were a huge part of the victory. The Hawks’ other Wblue liners were Riley Stillman (21:49, assist), Caleb Jones (12:29, 3 blocked shots), Ian Mitchell (9:12) and Jakub Galvas, who played nearly 24 minutes in his NHL debut and quarterbacked the No. 1 power play.
""I was very surprised how good he played,"" King said of Galvas, a fifth-round pick of the Hawks in 2017 who has played 20 games in Rockford this season. ""I knew he was pretty calm with the puck and he could skate and he could make plays and he’s a smart player. But he looked really good today.""
The Hawks fell behind at 12:51 of the first period, but DeBrincat knotted things up just 24 seconds later after taking a perfect feed from Stillman.
A charging de Haan snapped the 1-1 tie when he took a pass from Philipp Kurashev and snapped a shot that beat Columbus goalie Joonas Korpisalo at 15:40 of the second period. De Haan now has 1 goal in each of the last five seasons.
""D-men getting some loving is always nice,"" said Murphy, who made it 3-1 at 6:36 of the third period. ""I feel like Stilly’s had a couple great games making some plays offensively and continuing to be a hard defender.
""And (de Haan) too. He had a couple blocks. His hands were all bruised up. I think he had to get an X-ray to make sure the one was OK in between periods.
""Guys knowing that that’s what it takes to win is (important). Block some shots and play smart ‘D’ and you get rewarded with some offense.""
The Hawks (13-18-5) return home to face Montreal on Thursday and Anaheim on Saturday before playing at Seattle on Monday. They were supposed to play Edmonton on Tuesday, but that game was canceled.
Columbus is 4-11-1 in its last 16 games and 16-17-1 overall.",Hawks buckle down for 2nd straight win
312,"SAILOR'S REMAINS RETURNED
I know I speak for many, in expressing my gratitude to the Star Tribune staff, especially Matt McKinney and Jerry Holt (photo), for sharing the heartfelt story of 1st Class Neal Todd's homecoming to the Todd and Staffenhagen family for final rest (""Home, at long last, from Pearl Harbor,"" front page, July 9). No one of us can imagine the excruciating pain of nearly 80 years of not knowing the fate of a loved one lost during military service: the endless uncertainty, the wondering -- did he suffer, where and how was he lost, will a chance to say ""goodbye"" ever happen? What we can do, however, is today celebrate with this family, together honoring him on behalf of this nation, assuring his sacrifice will never be forgotten. No matter the circumstances, Todd's long-awaited ""coming home"" is a proud moment, one we all joyfully share!

MINNESOTA'S BUDGET
Bipartisanship notwithstanding, long-term challenges persist
Two weeks ago, the Star Tribune Editorial Board approvingly noted a number of bipartisan compromises contained within the state's budget deal. Some of these, such as increased education funding and bonus pay for emergency workers, are indeed worth celebrating. But it would be a mistake to conclude that ""bipartisan"" means ""reasonable.""
The truth is that Minnesota's budget has become entirely decoupled from the state's spending needs. Total state and local spending has declined by 15% since the 1990s, and our basic services are suffering as a result.
Minnesota schools, for example, receive less per pupil (adjusted for inflation) today than they did in 2001 and are short an estimated 6,000 nurses and guidance counselors. Likewise, experts estimate that the Department of Transportation is $900 million per year shy of what it needs to meet minimum safety and sufficiency standards for our roads, bridges and transit.
Considered in this light, the problem is less with where budget negotiations ended and more with where they began -- a status quo that is unacceptable to Minnesotans commuting on potholed roads and sending their children to underfunded schools.
To help close the investment gap and address Minnesota's staggering racial disparities, Gov. Tim Walz and the DFL proposed a series of tax hikes on corporations and the wealthy. But Republicans refused any tax increases, even on millionaires and corporate tax avoiders.
Republicans and the DFL can be commended for the country's only bipartisan budget, but long-term funding challenges will persist so long as the revenue shortage goes unaddressed.

RONDO
Overcome any barriers to direct community involvement
In response to ""Rondo dreams becoming a reality"" (front page, July 6), I am thrilled at the intent, scope and support of the Rondo land bridge and the work of ReConnect Rondo. The emphasis placed on reclaiming social justice through increased housing, employment and community space is long overdue and exciting to watch come to fruition.
However, I was given pause when the article states that ""[e]fforts to engage Rondo residents in person … have been hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic but should ramp up in September."" I understand that the pandemic has created immeasurable obstacles, but who is this land bridge for if not the residents of the Rondo neighborhood and surrounding community? Regardless of circumstances, pandemic or otherwise, all moves forward must be done in complete partnership with the individuals from the Rondo neighborhood.
This project has been many years in the making, and the continued planning and implementation will span years into our future. My hope during that time is that engaging residents is never an afterthought and that any barriers to including the community are swiftly overcome for the betterment and success of the project.

COSBY-TRUMP PROSECUTIONS
A dubious comparison, and the question left unanswered
I read the July 8 commentary by Minneapolis lawyer Marshall H. Tanick (""What Bill Cosby and Donald Trump have in common"") and dispute his premise. He states that although Bill Cosby admitted to tranquilizing multiple women so he could rape them, he made the confession under a deal that made clear he would not be charged. He was charged, though, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court declared that his subsequent trial had been unfair. Tanick revels in this decision as a ""scathing rebuke of prosecutorial wrongdoing."" Bill Cosby walks free after three years in prison.
Tanick leaps then to Donald Trump's CFO Allen Weisselberg, who for 15 years has doctored the Trump Organization's books, it is alleged, to greatly enhance his own bottom line by nearly $2 million and to avoid paying taxes. Tanick calls the methodical investigation ""unseemly,"" ""bordering on irresponsible bullying,"" and the charges ""trumped up."" He even brushes off the crime by stating that tax evasion like this is ""usually handled without jail time.""
What crime, may I ask, is great enough for Mr. Tanick to agree to its investigation and to imprisonment of the suspects if found guilty? I imagine that the huge number of mostly poor, often members of the BIPOC community, currently sitting in prisons and jails for minor drug offenses and nonviolent crimes, would like to know. Because the ""law and order"" folks definitely want them in jail. Why does a person not go to jail if they steal $2 million from American taxpayers, but rot in prison and have an endless record to harm future job and housing prospects for selling drugs or stealing catalytic convertors?
White-collar crime, indeed.

UPTOWN ART FAIR
A National Guard presence? There's an old precedent.
A July 9 letter writer's proposal for the National Guard to patrol the Uptown Art Fair in Minneapolis may seem outlandish. But the National Guard had a role in a watershed event in art history: the first public exhibition of modern art in the United States. The exhibit, with paintings by Europeans such as Matisse, Duchamp and Picasso, was held in 1913 at New York City's 69th Regiment National Guard Armory. One way or another, you could probably trace most of the art at the Uptown Art Fair back to the 1913 Armory Show.

315,"Jan. 11NORWALK  Bob Colish thinks it is time for people to step up and do their part in the fight against COVID-19.
Colish, 82, of Norwalk, has a banner on the side of a military vehicle in his front yard telling people what they should be doing to protect themselves and others.
The sign reads:
Congress  slow down death, government has no plan.
We will keep distance and wear masks.
Don't wait for the vaccine  save lives now.
Step 1: Get extra PPE and ventilators for all 50 states.
Step 2: Employ laid-off workers to test and trace.
Step 3: Set up enough testing stations and labs for quick turnaround.
Step 4: When ready  go for broke  defense production act.
""We are running out of supplies,"" Colish said. ""Each state is competing with each other. I think it has to be national. We are lacking information and we are ill-prepared with supplies.
""I hope things get better when (President-Elect Joe) Biden gets in.""
Colish is a veteran of the Marines (1956 to 59) and the Army (1962-65).
He went back into the service during the Cold War, a period of tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II.
""That's when (President John) Kennedy and (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev were going at it,"" Colish said. ""When they got into it I said 'Oh boy.' I was involved in missiles ... you can get more with a missile than you can with a gun.
""It was close.""
Colish lives at 11 E. Washington St. and has ""eight to 10"" military vehicles in his yard. He has been a regular at parades for years in town.
This year was different from the pandemic.
""They all run ... they are ready to go,"" Colish said. ""I had time to work on them because we didn't have a parade this year.""
While there were no official parades, Colish and others had ""unofficial"" events on Memorial Day and the Fourth of July.
""We got together with everybody from the American Legion, VFW and the Marine Corps League,"" Colish said. ""They were small and we didn't tell many people. We thought it was a good idea so we did it.""
Is the sign doing any good?
""I have only talked to a couple but I see a lot of people stopping and taking a picture,"" Colish said.

The New York City jail system is in disorder and use of force against inmates is at a five-year high, a court-appointed federal monitor said in a newly published report.
The 342-page document said the rate of use of force in city jails was higher in 2020 than any year since at least 2015, with an average of 11.3 incidents of force per 100 inmates. That figure is 38% higher than the 2019 average rate of 8.2 incidents of force per 100 inmates. Slightly more than half of the incidents had either procedural errors or involved avoidable or problematic force, according to the report.
While some use-of-force tactics have been curtailed, the report said, the federal monitor Steve Martin and his team were concerned about the overall state of reform within the city's Department of Correction, which runs the Rikers Island jail complex and other city detention centers. ""The pervasive level of disorder and chaos in the Facilities is alarming,"" the report said.
Mr. Martin was appointed a monitor to oversee overhaul efforts at city jails as part of a 2015 settlement of a civil-rights lawsuit involving alleged abuses at the complex.
As part of his appointment, Mr. Martin was tasked with producing reports on efforts to improve jail conditions. His latest report, submitted to a federal judge on Tuesday, was the 11th about city jails.
The report followed an announcement earlier in the week that Department of Correction Commissioner Cynthia Brann was leaving her post after 3 1/2 years.
On Wednesday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that Ms. Brann would be succeeded by Vincent Schiraldi, a former commissioner of the city's Department of Probation.
In response to the latest federal monitor report, Ms. Brann said the Department of Correction recently instituted systems that allow the agency to investigate and review use-of-force incidents in near real-time. The Covid-19 pandemic impacted operations of the jail system, she said.
""We appreciate the monitor for acknowledging our ability to adapt in many areas,"" Ms. Brann said.
A representative for the correction officers' union didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mary Lynne Werlwas, director of the Prisoners' Rights Project at the New York nonprofit Legal Aid Society, which was among the plaintiffs in the 2015 class-action suit that prompted the federal oversight, said Correction Department leadership was at fault for not taking actions ""needed to dismantle the culture of brutality and incompetence in the jails.""

Individuals can sign up for notifications so state officials can communicate with them when doses become available at new and existing sites. Vaccine.ky.gov also lists regional vaccination partners statewide, so Kentuckians can search their county or region and see how to schedule an appointment.Kentucky's COVID-19 Vaccine Hotline, 855-598-2246, has the same features as the website. Kentuckians can get assistance completing the vaccine eligibility questionnaire and scheduling an appointment when doses are available.Free or reduced-cost transportation to and from vaccine appointments is offered by public transit agencies across the commonwealth.

Kentuckians can find transportation services near them by heading to kycovid19.ky.gov for a full list of participating public transit agencies and their phone numbers, or by calling the Kentucky COVID-19 Vaccine Hotline.Weather UpdateKentucky Division of Emergency Management Director Michael Dossett updated Kentuckians on the response to major floods across the commonwealth.Twenty cities and 44 counties have declared a state of emergency. Over 194 county roads closed due to flooding. Three counties have reported power outages: Breathitt, Jackson and Owsley. Lee and Owsley counties each have one shelter open; Breathitt County has two.""Fortunately, no fatalities have been reported due to flooding this week,"" said Director Dossett. ""But the damage is significant. Lee County's downtown business district was submerged in approximately six feet of water. Several manufactured homes as well as single family dwellings have been destroyed. Lee County Courthouse has suffered a major loss and other state and local government offices have been impacted. In Breathitt County, there was 5.48 inches of total rainfall, and some residents are still blocked in by water. We are still monitoring the breach at the dam that sits under Kentucky Highway 15 in Jackson and connects to Panbowl Lake, but the sand bag patch is holding, and Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, Division of Water Dam Inspector, Marilyn Thomas, has declared the dam is safe.""""I just want people across Kentucky to know you're not forgotten - we're here every step of the way to try to bring relief to this devastation that's happened to you and your communities, your homes and personal property, and to try to do everything we can to help with that recovery as we move forward,"" said Rocky Adkins, senior advisor to Gov. Beshear.Adkins added the state would be requesting two federal disaster declarations: one for ice storm damage and one for flooding damage.""For you homeowners and those of you who have had personal property damage, as well as road crews and local leaders - document the damage, take pictures,"" said Adkins. ""Make sure that's part of our information we send into Washington D.C. for those declarations. We need a full application that will go in for approval to come back and bring relief to our people who are hurting so bad.""Pandemic-Electronic Benefit Transfer UpdateToday, Gov. Beshear updated Kentuckians on the Pandemic-Electronic Benefit Transfer (P-EBT) program, which helps ensure Kentucky's kids do not miss meals during virtual learning that would have been provided to them if their school was open in-person.""We are so pleased to announce the launch of Round Three of Pandemic Electronic Benefits assistance, which applies to the time period from October through the remainder of the 2020-2021 school year,"" said Gov. Beshear. ""Our expert family support team estimates we will have a total monthly issuance of almost $74 million to Kentucky families, and a total program issuance - that covers the entire eight-month academic year - of $590 million. The dollar figures don't mean as much to us as knowing the thousands of school children who will get access to nutritious meals through this funding.""P-EBT is approved for both public and private school students who receive free or reduced price meals through the National School Lunch Program and who were are unable to attend school in-person due to COVID-19 school closures since October. Eligible students and families don't have to do anything - approval is automatic. There is no application process. P-EBT for October 2020 and beyond will be added to existing cards.* If the student currently receives food benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), P-EBT benefits will be added to the head-of-household's EBT card.* If the student does not receive SNAP, P-EBT will be added to the cards that were previously issued (fall 2020) in each student's name.* If an individual no longer has the card and their address has not changed, they should call 1-888-979-9949 to request a replacement card.If their address has changed, they should call the Department of Community Based Services (DCBS) at 1-855-306-8959 to report the change and request a new card.An eligible student will receive the equivalent of 20 days' benefits - that equals $136.40 - if his or her school district exclusively operated a virtual-only learning model for all students in a given month. An eligible student whose school district operated a combination of in-person and virtual learning environment - also called ""hybrid"" learning - in a given month will receive the equivalent of 12 days' benefits - which equals $81.84. Individuals should expect to receive the first issuance of P-EBT the week of March 15.Some families may have mistakenly received P-EBT cards during the last round of stimulus. Individuals are not obligated to use them if they do not want to or if they know their child does not qualify. If you do not want to receive P-EBT, call DCBS at 1-855-306-8959 to opt out.Unemployment Insurance UpdateToday, Amy Cubbage, general counsel for Gov. Beshear, updated Kentuckians on a new call center and tips for combatting fraud and verifying identification in the unemployment insurance (UI) system.New Call Center Opening in April""Due to some additional federal funding we've been able to procure, we will be opening a new call center in April. We are currently hiring for that call center and as soon as those people are trained and we have everything in place, that will significantly increase our call capacity,"" said Cubbage. ""This is just one of the ways we're trying to give you a better experience. Soon, our new user interface we've been working on will be rolled out, and this will hopefully get us through to the point where we can rebuild the entire system.""Reset Four Digit PIN to Combat Fraud""In an effort to combat fraud against your UI account, we are recommending a change to your four digit PIN if it resembles any personal information about you such as your house number, birth year, last four of your social security number or phone number,"" said Cubbage.Also, avoid simple number sequences like 1234, 9999, 5678, etc.New Partnership with Nationally Renowned Company for ID Verification""ID.me is a federally certified identity verification provider that specializes in digital identity protection,"" said Cubbage. ""They are the only provider to offer a video chat option for citizens that may need additional assistance.""More than 36 million people use ID.me to manage their digital identity.

320,"(TNSsro) -- The Washington State Utilities and Transportation Commission issued the following order (No. TG-210437):In the Matter of the Petition of HAROLD LEMAY ENTERPRISES, INC. d/b/a PIERCE COUNTY REFUSE, Certificate G-98, Petitioner, Seeking Approval of Cost Recovery through Rates; Seeking Exemption from WAC 480-07-520(4) Relating to Submission of WorkpapersORDER ALLOWING TARIFF REVISION; GRANTING EXEMPTION FROM WAC 480-07-520(4)BACKGROUND1 On June 8, 2021, Harold Lemay Enterprises, Inc., d/b/a Pierce County Refuse (Pierce County Refuse or Company) filed with the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission (Commission) proposed revisions to Piece County Refuse's Tariff No. 10 to recover costs of $252,860, equivalent to 0.73 percent of annual revenue, related to the COVID-19 pandemic divided over a two-year period, beginning September 1, 2021, and ending August 31, 2023. In its cover letter, the Company also requested an exemption from WAC 480-07-520(4) (Petition). The result is $129,350 (0.37 percent) of additional annual revenue. This request affects approximately 59,000 residential, 5,000 commercial, 177 roll-off garbage customers, and 58,900 residential recycling, 600 multi-family recycling, and 29,600 yard-waste customers in Pierce County and Joint Base Lewis-McChord served by the Company.2 The Company is requesting an exemption from WAC 480-07-520(4), which requires companies to submit specified workpapers when filing for rate changes. The Company states in its filing that the recovery of these funds is being treated like a pass-through of known, incremental costs, similar to a disposal fee filing. Pierce County Refuse's last general rate increase took effect May 1, 2020, during which all the Company's expenses were reviewed./13 The Company submits that it has adequately tracked costs incurred for safety supplies and equipment, COVID-related sick-leave, and bonus wages paid to ensure a safe working environment and adequate staffing in dedicated general ledger accounts. The Company supplied the ledger accounts as workpapers supporting its request and provided documentation showing how the tariff revision was calculated, along with tariff pages with an expiration date of August 31, 2023, for the increased rates and tariff pages to be implemented upon expiration of the recovery period.4 Commission staff (Staff) recommends allowing the Company's tariff revision to become effective by operation of law and granting an exemption from the workpaper requirements in WAC 480-07-520(4). Staff requested regulated companies to submit COVID-19 cost recovery filings separately from general rate cases as these are significant but abnormal costs incurred during a state of emergency. If the Company were to seek recovery of these expenses through a general rate case these costs would normally be amortized over a similar period as proposed in this filing. Staff believes allowing the expenses to be recovered separately from a general rate case over a specified period will ensure the costs are recovered, but not over collected.5 Staff has reviewed the resulting rates and finds them to be fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient.DISCUSSION6 We agree with Staff's recommendation and approve Pierce County Refuse's Petition for an exemption. Pursuant to WAC 480-07-110, the Commission may, in response to a request or on its own motion, grant an exemption from its own rules when ""consistent with the public interest, the purposes underlying regulation, and applicable statutes.""/27 Staff recommends the Commission grant an exemption from the workpaper requirements of WAC 480-07-520(4). This exemption is consistent with the public interest because the rate increase seeks to recover short-term expenses incurred during a government declared state of emergency necessary to maintain safe and reliable service. The Company recorded costs and expenses incurred in such a manner the records could be provided to Staff for review independent of a general rate case. Staff believes the records adequately support the rates and time frame requested by the Company.8 We also find that the the Company's proposed tariff revisions to recover costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic are fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient. Accordingly, the Commission concludes that Pierce County Refuse's proposed tariff revisions should become effective by operation of law on September 1, 2021.FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS9 (1) The Commission is an agency of the State of Washington vested by statute with the authority to regulate the rates, rules, regulations, practices, accounts, and affiliated interests of public service companies, including solid waste companies.10 (2) Pierce County Refuse is engaged in the business of providing solid waste services within the state of Washington and is a public service company subject to Commission jurisdiction.11 (3) Pierce County Refuse is subject to WAC 480-70-520(4), which requires solid waste companies to submit specified workpapers when filing for rate changes.12 (4) Under WAC 480-70-051, the Commission may grant an exemption from the provisions of any rule in WAC 480-70 if doing so is consistent with the public interest, the purposes underlying regulation, and applicable statutes. See also WAC 480-07-110.13 (5) This matter came before the Commission at its regularly scheduled meeting on August 26, 2021.14 (6) After reviewing Pierce County Refuse's Petition filed in Docket TG-210437 on June 8, 2021, and giving due consideration, the Commission finds the proposed tariff revision is fair, just, reasonable, and sufficient, and should become effective by operation of law on September 1, 2021.15 (7) The Commission also finds that Pierce County Refuse's Petition for exemption is in the public interest and is consistent with the purposes underlying the regulation and applicable statues and should be granted.ORDERTHE COMMISSION ORDERS:16 (1) Harold Lemay Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Pierce County Refuse, is granted an exemption from WAC 480-70-520(4), for the purpose of the tariff revision filed in this docket on June 8, 2021.17 (2) The tariff revision Harold Lemay Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Pierce County Refuse filed on June 8, 2021, will become effective by operation of law on September 1, 2021.18 (3) The Commission retains jurisdiction over the subject matter and Harold Lemay Enterprises, Inc. d/b/a Pierce County Refuse to effectuate the provisions of this Order.DATED at Lacey, Washington, and effective August 26, 2021.WASHINGTON UTILITIES AND TRANSPORTATION COMMISSIONDAVID W.

321,"Forty Republican senators argue that the Biden administration broke the law in suspending congressionally authorized border wall construction and are asking the Government Accountability Office for its opinion on the matter.
President Biden’s Jan. 20 action pausing the wall’s construction amounts to a “blatant violation of federal law” that “directly contributed” to the current border crisis, the senators said in a letter outlining their case to Comptroller General Gene Dodaro.
“In the weeks that followed, operational control of our southern border was compromised and a humanitarian and national security crisis has ensued,” the letter said.
In his order, Biden directed that the pause applies to wall projects funded by redirected funds and those funded by direct appropriations, a move the senators said infringes on Congress’s ""constitutional power of the purse.”
BIDEN HAS NO PLANS TO VISIT THE SOUTHERN BORDER 'AT THE MOMENT'
Appropriations for former President Donald Trump’s border wall priorities passed in recent Congresses helped to prevent surges in illegal immigration such as those being managed now, the senators said.
“Not coincidentally, and in conjunction with a number of other important immigration policy reforms, the rate of illegal border crossings fell substantially and operational control of the border increased dramatically,” they said.
Biden has rolled back a number of Trump-era immigration policies. He ended the emergency declaration that Trump had made with regard to the southern border, and his administration stopped U.S. Customs and Border Protection from expelling unaccompanied migrant children.
Congressional Republicans have been fiercely critical of the Biden administration’s approach.
“At a time when the president will keep our country closed, when maybe we have hoped for a Fourth of July to get together just with their family, how much spread of COVID is he creating every single day by his policies along this border?” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said in a Monday press conference in El Paso, Texas.
Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who led the effort on Wednesday’s letter to the GAO, said the border situation ""is a result of the president — President Biden and his, not just even signaling, but his statements of ‘Nobody’s going to be turned back.’”
Tweet
Senate Democratic leadership did not give as grim an assessment of the border in a Tuesday press conference but did discuss the need for action.
“I think we need to deal with this reality at the border,” Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin said, discussing legislative possibilities. “I said to the administration, ‘Come forward with your plan.’”
Of Biden's order on the wall, the Republican senators said, “The only lawful justification of for these actions would be if the president: (1) transmits to Congress a special message proposing the deferral of the funds; (2) transmits to Congress a special message proposing the permanent rescission of those funds; or (3) can point to a pragmatic delay responsible for the pause in obligation.""
“The Biden administration has pursued none of these paths,"" they wrote.

The Washington Examiner reached out to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, as well as Vice Chairman Richard Shelby, who undersigned the Republican letter, about what effect Biden's actions on border wall funding have on the appropriations process but did not receive a response.

324,"""Prices have clearly gone up, and we're seeing that trend continue.""
Peter Lukszys
University of Wisconsin School of Business
Lois  Horne of Wauwatosa went to Sentry Foods in Milwaukee the first week of November in the hope of getting her Thanksgiving turkey.  It was a Thursday afternoon. The Wednesday coupon sheet she got in the mail had an Essential Everyday brand turkey that would go on special Thursday morning. By the time she got there at 4 p.m., the turkey was sold out.  ""I'm sure a lot of people are buying them at this price because I heard everything is supposed to be a lot higher,"" Horne said. ""Grocery shopping recently, it's terrible. There are many things that are doubled.""
Name-brand turkeys were still available, but Horne was hoping to get the deal.
But deals might be harder to come by this year. With many supply chain issues, especially many increased costs involved in moving products, Thanksgiving dinners in 2021 are likely to cost more than they ever have.
All grocers have seen price increases, according to Joe Zink, vice president of store merchandise at Festival Foods.
""There will still be the same key Thanksgiving items we know and love advertised, but the prices will likely not be as low as they were prior to 2020,"" Zink said in an email. ""There have been difficulties not only from the manufacturing standpoint in keeping up with demand, but also in regards to transportation.""
Cass Information Systems released a report in September that showed shipping cost 34% more than the previous September.
""Prices have clearly gone up, and we're seeing that trend continue,"" said Peter Lukszys, University of Wisconsin School of Business expert on logistics and supply chain management. ""Consumption during last year was down because fewer Thanksgivings were being celebrated. This year there is more demand, and when there is more demand, it is more likely to have shortages.""
Aside from transportation issues, many other cost increases are being calculated before food hits the grocery shelf.
The price of steel is up about 130% from a year ago. That cost can translate to higher prices for canned goods.
A survey from the Wisconsin Potato and Vegetable Growers Association showed that fertilizer cost farmers 63% more than before COVID-19.
""I've heard anecdotes that everything is going up. It's fair to expect increases in the cost of food just based on the cost of production increases occurring all across agriculture,"" said Tamas Houlihan, executive director of the Wisconsin Potato & Vegetable Growers Association.
Because of a difficult growing season, about 100 million fewer pounds of cranberries were grown in the state, according to the Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association.
Fresh cranberry fruit will likely go fast.
""I'd purchase my Christmas fruit now, because I don't think they'll be available after Thanksgiving,"" said Tom Lochner, executive director of Wisconsin State Cranberry Growers Association.
Libby's pumpkin puree is going for about $2.79 for a 15-ounce can at stores around the Milwaukee area. Jennie-O turkeys at Sentry were going for $1.79 a pound.
""Shop early, shop local and, probably, you'll have to substitute and be flexible,"" Lukszys advised. ""You might not be able to get that exact cranberry that you get every year. There are shortages in everything.""
Shop early for Thanksgiving
Lukszys said shopping early is especially important in getting a potential deal. Off-brand items that are usually cheaper could be the first to go, leaving just name-brand, more expensive, Thanksgiving food items closer to the holiday.
The American Farm Bureau Federation estimated the average cost of a Thanksgiving dinner in 2020 to be about $47. It has not released numbers estimating how expensive a Thanksgiving dinner this year could be.
To get an idea of how much more expensive groceries are in 2021, the Consumer Price Index showed that in September this year, at home food prices were up 4.5% from the previous September. In particular, the meat, poultry and fish category was up 10.5% over last year.
When it comes to shopping local, there is less shipping involved, therefore fewer logistical issues, Lukszys said. But local food products can go more quickly.
For example, Kettle Range Meat Co., in Milwaukee and Elm Grove, sold out of turkey. Owner Mark Bearce said it was not unusual for them to be sold out by early November.
""We source all of our stuff locally, and we have turkeys raised for us, so it doesn't have anything to do with the supply chain,"" Bearce said.
This year they sold about 600 turkeys by Nov. 4.
""We are a small shop and can't handle a lot more than that, even if there is higher demand,"" Bearce said. ""We have to commit to our turkeys in February. We buy the babies and put them on our farms.""
Early planning goes a long way for feeding people on Thanksgiving, especially in a year with as many economic disruptors as 2021 has had. That goes for local food banks, as well.
""Hunger Task Force preplans Thanksgiving holidays. We have bought truckloads of turkeys, and we are ready to feed seniors, families and everyone in our network,"" said Sherrie Tussler, executive director at Hunger Task Force.
Tussler said they are confident in their supply of food. The task force has large donors such as the Milwaukee Bucks, Fiserv Forum, local television stations and many individual donors.
Wisconsin shoppers who can go early have seen some savings.
Mountain resident Lynn Huntley, food blogger at Turnips 2 Tangerines, is semi-retired and has much of her Thanksgiving meal prepared. She has pie filling ready to be baked the day before Thanksgiving, cranberry sauce set, and stuffing.
She saw a turkey on sale for 89 cents a pound and purchased it immediately.
One thing she's skipping this year because of prices? A side salad.
""I saw a head of lettuce was $4.99, so forget about the salad this year, or anything that will use it all together,"" Huntley said.

325,"Erica Belling, Investor and Financial Communications, 416-594-7251, erica.belling@cibc.com TORONTO, March 8, 2021 /CNW/ - CIBC (TSX: CM) (NYSE: CM) today released its 2020 Sustainability Report, providing an update on the bank's sustainability progress across all areas of its operations. The report also provides examples of how CIBC is tackling relevant sustainability challenges head on – from climate change and social justice issues to the economic challenges faced by families, businesses and communities.
""2020 was an unprecedented year for the global economy as we faced a pandemic that had deep repercussions for society. Guided by our purpose of helping make ambitions real, we responded to COVID-19 and the accompanying social and economic disruption by decisively supporting our clients, team members and communities,"" said Victor G. Dodig, CIBC President and CEO. ""We also mobilized our people, resources and expertise to move towards a lower carbon world and a more sustainable and inclusive economy.""  
Over the past few years, CIBC has accelerated its contribution to creating a more sustainable future. In 2020, the bank intensified its investments in key environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives. Highlights from the past year include: CIBC made continued progress against its target of mobilizing $150 billion for environmental and sustainable finance by 2027, achieving 28% of its 10-year target over the last three years. CIBC issued a US$500 million, five-year green bond to help finance new and existing green projects, assets, and businesses that mitigate the risks and effects of climate change. These include renewable energy, green buildings, clean transportation, natural resource conservation, biodiversity conservation, energy efficiency, and pollution prevention and control. CIBC was recognized by CDP as one of the highest-ranking Canadian financial institutions and in the top-tier of global banks for climate change actions with a score of A-. The bank expanded its inclusion targets to ensure that newly-recruited team members reflect the communities and clients served by CIBC, including actively seeking top talent from the Black community. CIBC President and CEO, Victor Dodig, co-chairs the BlackNorth Initiative, which encourages leading organizations in Canada to make specific commitments to combat anti-Black systemic racism. CIBC invested $75 million in more than 4,800 community organizations across North America, toward its target of $350 million between 2019 and 2023. More than 6,500 CIBC team members volunteered and raised funds in the annual Canadian Cancer Society CIBC Run for the Cure, which was reimagined as a hybrid virtual and physical experience. Variable compensation tied to ESGBuilding on these results, CIBC aligned its variable incentive plan to its ESG performance, becoming one of the first Canadian banks to link employee and executive pay to ESG-related criteria. As more investors seek to invest in companies that perform better on ESG metrics and policy makers increasingly look to banks to support the transition to a low-carbon economy, CIBC's incentive compensation will be tied to performance towards its sustainable finance investment target and other key metrics.
Transparency in reporting CIBC's approach to sustainability reporting continues to evolve, reflecting the bank's commitment to continuous improvement, transparency and being responsive to the information needs of its stakeholders: During 2020, CIBC completed a materiality assessment to better understand the issues that matter most to stakeholders. The bank commissioned an independent research consultancy to study priority issues and drivers of trust among CIBC's key stakeholders. CIBC's reporting is aligned with international standards, including the Global Reporting Initiative, Sustainability Accounting Standards Board and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. More recently, CIBC has announced the following commitments:  RMI's Center for Climate Aligned Finance as a Strategic Partner and the first Canadian bank to announce its partnership in the Center's efforts to develop the agreements and tools necessary to align financial decision-making with the long-term decarbonization of the real economy. Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF), an initiative led by the financial industry to develop a harmonized global standard to measure and disclose the greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of loans and investments. CIBC is further investing in Black leaders, changemakers and entrepreneurs by doubling funding for education and resource programs for the Black community to $2 million annually. This includes the creation of a scholarship program, and the opportunity for internship and mentorship experiences, aimed at supporting members of the Black community in achieving their ambitions.

335,"BRANFORD — When Barbara “Bobbi” Racette learned of the 13 U.S. service members killed during the recent suicide bomb attack outside of Kabul’s Hamid Karzai International Airport, she immediately thought of the lunch trays she distributes to veterans each September at the Stand Down at Rocky Hill.
The two-day event gives veterans access to in-person services like medical screenings, legal assistance, and meals to go.
“Each year I hand out lunch trays and the veterans thank me for volunteering and then they turn and give the tray to the person behind them,” she said.
It was the same display of selflessness, she said, that prompted her to fly the flag at half-mast at her Brushy Plains home in recognition of the fallen service members — and go one step further.
Racette said she didn’t want to get into politics, or policy. “Those 13 signed on the dotted line to go where they were needed, and they paid the ultimate price. This is about honoring their sacrifice.”
Around the larger flag, she planted 13 smaller flags, one for each of the service members.

She joined an outpouring of tributes across the country for the men and women killed in the attack, from 13 boots lining the road leading to Camp LeJeune; to 13 patrol cars in the shape of a heart in Kissimee, Fla.; to 13 pints of ale at a table at Guilford Mooring.
“I can’t speak for everyone who’s found different ways to honor them, but I know I needed to do something,” Racette said. “My heart hurts for those we’ve lost and for their families, and this is my way of showing that they’re not forgotten.”
As an associate Blue Star Mother — her son is a first responder — Racette said she’s been in touch with Blue Star Mothers, defined as those who have sons or daughters in active military service.
“It’s not only the sense that their work has come to nothing,” she said. “It’s also all the months of separation and the missed special occasions, and a real fear of what’s going to happen to the Afghan people they formed close bonds with.”

For that reason, “I don’t want anybody to thank me, that’s not the purpose of this at all,” said Racette, who’s also been active in the Wreaths Across America movement. “Don’t thank me, thank someone who served.”
Adrian Bonenberger, a Connecticut-based writer and combat veteran of Afghanistan, said he was inspired by the tributes being paid to the fallen service members.
“It reminds me of all the others who gave their lives so that the Afghans would not have to live under an oppressive regime,” he wrote via Facebook. “The resonance of their sacrifice testifies to our collective capacity for hope.”
Racette recalled attending a Veterans’ Day parade in Branford with her daughter Irene.
“It was cold and rainy, and the wind was whipping around, and we were miserable,” she said. “Irene asked if we could leave.”

336,"It was everything any athlete dreams of for a playoff game.
A big, loud crowd and a gym crackling with energy.
A dynamic game with two quality opponents trading big swings of momentum back and forth from the first minute to the last.
And everything the Fort Collins High School girls basketball team worked for — perfect until the finish.
Instead of continuing a tumultuous but sensational season, it ended.
No. 19 Pine Creek beat No. 14 Fort Collins 42-40 in a Class 5A second-round playoff game.
""The band came, we had fans, we have awesome parents. That's the atmosphere you want. That's the type of game you want. Everything but the final score,"" Fort Collins coach Kerstin Young said.
Fort Collins (17-7) looked bound for its first Sweet 16 since 2013 in the fourth quarter as the Lambkins held an eight-point (37-29) lead with just over 5 minutes left.
The hosts had used a late third- and early fourth-quarter run to take control. But as had been the case all game, there was another momentum change coming.
Pine Creek (16-9) cut into the lead and, in the final minutes, harassed Fort Collins with ball pressure that disrupted the Lambkins throughout as turnovers proved decisive in the game.
Multiple turnovers in the final 2 minutes brought Pine Creek back within one, and the Eagles took the lead (41-40) via free throws with 28.7 seconds left.
Fort Collins turned it over on the next possession, then had to foul. Pine Creek made one, and Fort Collins star Shayne Young had a shot to win it with a deep step-back 3-pointer at the buzzer. But it came up tantalizingly short of a dramatic winner.
""They worked their butts off,"" Kerstin Young said. ""Obviously, there's plays here and there that I'm sure we could have done a little bit better, but they worked their butt off. They did exactly what I needed them to do.""
Fort Collins senior Emily Johnson and sophomore Penley Park had 13 points each. Paige Fry had nine points.
It was a tough end to a sensational season. The Lambkins won seven in a row to end the regular season and earn a first-round bye. It was the first time Fort Collins hosted a second-round playoff game since 2012. The 17 wins is the most since 2018.
There were several records set along the way. Johnson set the program's career rebounds mark. Young set the career 3-point record, and freshman Avery Alcaraz set the single-season 3-point record.
And all of it came during a tumultuous season. Not only was it another wonky season with COVID concerns lurking, but head coach Matt Hower left midseason for a job on the University of Colorado women's basketball staff.
In stepped Young, and the team managed to thrive as the season went on.
""Everything they took in stride. I couldn't have asked for a better team. That was hard. They could have easily crumbled midseason and they didn't,"" Kerstin Young said. ""I just fell in love with this team and these girls. They're amazing.""

337,"People in New Orleans will be required to show either proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid-19 test to enter certain indoor places starting Monday, according to the city.
The new rule will apply to those who want to visit bars, restaurants, breweries, gyms, fitness centers, sports complexes and stadiums, New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell said Thursday, as officials work to stem the latest rise in Covid-19 infections.
At least 2,901 people in Louisiana are hospitalized with Covid-19, health officials said on Thursday, which is the state's highest number of Covid-19 hospitalizations since the start of the pandemic.
""This update represents increases across all regions and age groups,"" the Louisiana Department of Health tweeted.
Approximately 37.9% of the state's total population are fully vaccinated, which is one of the lowest rates in the country, according to federal health data Thursday.
Late last month, Cantrell instituted a mask mandate in indoor settings and large outdoor crowds in New Orleans for everyone regardless of vaccination status. At the time, she said emergency medical responders were hit so hard with a spike in Covid-19 cases that they didn't have the capacity to handle 911 calls.
NFL's Saints, others to follow requirements
The order will become effective Monday, and the city will begin aggressive enforcement on August 23.
""But again, I'm encouraging our businesses, you don't have to wait, you can go ahead and activate,"" Cantrell said. ""Don't look for reasons to be the exception. Don't look for the loopholes. Look for your vaccination card and be prepared to show it.""
People must prove they have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine or that they tested negative for the virus no more than 72 hours prior.
Concert centers, music halls, event spaces, adult performances, casinos and racetracks are expected to adhere to the latest public health safety measure, intended to mitigate Covid-19 infections in places considered to have higher transmission of the coronavirus. Large outdoor activities of more than 500 people are also ordered to follow the new rule.
The New Orleans Saints will implement the new requirements, saying in a statement that the changes will allow for ""full capacity"" at the Caesars Superdome stadium.
""We must comply with those regulations to safely return to full capacity for the first time in more than a year and a half,"" the team said Thursday. ""We are committed to doing everything we can in the current environment to protect your health and safety while at the same time providing the best game day experience in the NFL.""
The Saints added that masks will also be required, in accordance with the state's mandate that lasts until at least September 1.
""We understand some will be frustrated, as are we, that we find ourselves in this position. We, as a community, have overcome so much in our history and come back stronger every time,"" the team said.

339,"With winter underway and cases of Omicron surging nationwide, you may be wondering if  that runny nose or aching throat is a dreaded case of COVID-19 that's finally tracked you down, or if it's merely a symptom of the common cold.On top of that,  the flu virus, which had all but vanished last year as the pandemic gripped the nation, appears to be making a comeback, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Distinguishing between it all can be hard, and finding a COVID-19 test can be harder. Here we try to break down what we know about Omicron symptoms so far (remember, much is unknown this early in the outbreak) and how they may differ from the common cold and flu, or even from the previous variant, Delta.What does early data tell us about Omicron?Omicron is now the dominant variant in the country and is spreading at a rapid rate, with cases rising about 23 percent in the past two weeks or so alone, according to data from the CDC. The variant has an unusually high number of mutations, some of which may be enabling it to evade immune protection. And early data has demonstrated that it is about two to three times more transmissible than the Delta variant. As a result, many, including those who are vaccinated, are likely to test positive for the virus.Because the variant is a relatively new discovery, scientists are still studying the severity of illness  and  what symptoms it will bring  — and if they vary from other strains. Some hopeful news arrived this week, with three teams of scientists, who studied the course Omicron took in South Africa, Scotland, and England, releasing preliminary results that showed infections more often resulted in mild illness compared to those from the Delta variant before it.  The findings suggested those infected were less likely to be hospitalized, but there were caveats.How are Omicron symptoms similar to Delta or other variants?Preliminary reports indicate that those infected with the variant generally display similar symptoms to those who have been infected with either Delta or the original coronavirus.Data scientists with the health company ZOE used the most recent data from London, where the prevalence of Omicron is higher than in other regions throughout the United Kingdom, to analyze symptom data  and compare it with data recorded in early October when Delta was dominant. The analysis found no clear difference between the two — and only about half of people experienced the “the classic three symptoms of fever, cough, or loss of sense of smell or taste.”  The top five recorded symptoms in both periods were a runny nose, headache, fatigue, sneezing, and sore throat. They tended to be  “mostly mild” and “cold-like.”Here in the United States, possible symptoms of the coronavirus listed by the CDC include fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea.How might Omicron symptoms differ from Delta or other variants?When Delta became the dominant variant and led to an uptick in cases, cold-like symptoms became more common, as the lead scientist on the ZOE COVID Study app noted last week. It appears to be the same case with Omicron,  and some of the key symptoms first seen earlier in the pandemic — namely a loss of taste and smell — are not as typical.An analysis published by researchers in Norway following a small Omicron outbreak among “fully vaccinated” people found that only 23 percent of patients reported a loss of taste, and only 12 percent reported a loss of smell. Meanwhile, a runny or stuffy nose, fatigue, cough, and a sore throat were the most common symptoms.Early evidence also suggests that Omicron is less likely to spread deep into the lung tissue, despite it replicating in the upper airway quickly, which could help to explain why infections may appear milder. A study undertaken by Hong Kong University researchers found that replication of the variant in deeper lung tissue was more than 10 times lower than the original strain of the virus.It should also be noted that, according to data collected by ZOE, the symptoms one experiences can vary depending on vaccination status.What about the common cold or flu?Both the flu and the common cold are contagious respiratory illnesses that share similar symptoms despite being caused by different viruses, according to the CDC. In general, flu symptoms are more intense and begin more abruptly, while colds are usually milder and do not typically result in serious health problems.The symptoms of the flu, according to the health protection agency, can include muscle or body aches and “fever or feeling feverish/chills.” It can have associated complications. Meanwhile, people who have a cold tend to have a runny or stuffy nose.Compared to the flu, COVID-19 can cause more serious illnesses in some people, according to the CDC. It can also take longer for people to experience symptoms and they can be contagious for a greater period of time.The CDC also stressed that because some of the symptoms of both the flu, the coronavirus, and other respiratory illnesses are so similar, testing is required to “tell what the illness is and to confirm a diagnosis,” especially because people can be infected with both the flu and COVID-19 at the same time.Still looking for answers and have places to be?In short, for those looking to determine what they are sick with for travel or planning purposes, public health experts recommend getting tested for the coronavirus beforehand.Read NextWhile COVID cases soar in Massachusetts, new Omicron data offers promisePCR or rapid antigen?

340,"The U.S. Department of Defense issued the text of the following transcript:* * *MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Ladies and gentlemen, foreign and defense ministers.Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We will now start the joint press conference of the ROK-U.S. foreign and defense ministers. The opening remarks will be made in the order of Minister Chung, Secretary Blinken, Minister Suh, and Secretary Austin.After the opening remarks of the four ministers and secretaries, we will have a Q&A by two journalists from the Korean and the U.S. side, respectively.First, Minister Chung.FOREIGN MINISTER CHUNG (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Good morning, everyone. It is my utmost pleasure to welcome and to stand with Secretary Blinken, Secretary Austin, and Minister Suh.First of all, regarding the gun shoot that happened in Atlanta, Georgia last night, I would like to send our deepest heart to those who are sacrificed. Among those sacrificed, we confirmed that there are Korean Americans as well. It is our utmost interest to seek the safety of those Koreans living in the U.S. Our heart also go to those who are sacrificed as Americans. Also, in the starting of the meeting today, both Secretary Blinken and Secretary Austin expressed their concerns and also the disheartening of the incident. Thank you very much for mentioning that.And also, I'd like to welcome two secretaries once again for coming to Korea in the early days of their appointment. It has been 11 years since we had the both secretaries of the State and Defense from the U.S. that happened in 2010. We confirmed once again today in this meeting that both countries are the linchpins of the peace, security, and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula, and the South -- in Northeast Asia with the ROK-U.S. Alliance having the 70 years of history. Based on the solid alliance, we made sure of the commitment to strengthen our strategic communications. Also, we are expecting that this kind of effort will be -- lead to the summit meeting between our two countries in the coming future.Also, we decided that reciprocal and the future-oriented cooperations will be further expanded having the cooperation of the discussions on the coming issues. The signing ceremony that happened right before -- regarding SMA -- has been reaffirming the solidity of the ROK-U.S. Alliance, having resolved a long-term issue.And also, both countries have confirmed our consensus on three major areas. First of all, the North Korea nuclear issue is the most immediate issue and it is necessary to have the close coordination between our two countries.Secondly, in order to resolve the North Korea nuclear issue in a peaceful manner, the best diplomatic efforts will be made based on the solid security base.Lastly, in the process of review process of the North Korea by the U.S., as well as the implementation period, fully coordinated strategy will be the base for our coordination. Both countries will continue to have the cooperation for the sake of the progress of the Korean peace process. Also, for the regional peace, security, and prosperity, both countries have decided to continue our cooperation, reciprocal, and the futuristic manner among the three lateral countries, with Japan. Also with the New Southern Policy and its cooperation, we decided to have the common prosperity and stability, especially in the Indo-Pacific area. Regarding climate change and COVID-19, we decided to have the joint responses based on our alliance. We also decided to have that cooperation of the 2+2 meeting. It will be very meaningful.And also, we reaffirmed that when both countries are together, we can have the strongest power, and also our greatest asset, which is the U.S. alliance, can be sound and is reciprocal in the future and meet the time of the demands.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you very much. Secretary Blinken, please.SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, good morning, everyone, and Mr. Minister Eui-yong, thank you for hosting us. It's an honor to join you, to join the defense minister, and of course, my friend and colleague Secretary of Defense Austin, for today's 2+2 ministerial meeting.Thank you also just for hosting me for two days in a row, and to the people of the Republic of Korea for, as always, their incredibly warm hospitality. And I want to reiterate again our outrage and grief over the deaths of eight women in Atlanta yesterday, including, we hear, four of Korean descent. We stand with the Korean community and everyone united against violence and hate.This trip, as has been noted, is the first by any member of President Biden's cabinet overseas, and it's no accident that Secretary Austin and I came here. The U.S.-Republic of Korea Alliance is, as we have long said, the linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity in Northeast Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and around the world. But we came here not only to reaffirm that fact and to reaffirm our alliance, but to build on it, and that is exactly what we've been doing.We just witnessed, as the minister said, the initialing of an agreement in principle on the text of the Special Measures Agreement. And this is the result of very diligent efforts by both sides to arrive at a fair and equitable agreement. It will strengthen our alliance. It will strengthen our shared defense.This effort and our trip to the region is part of the Biden-Harris administration's commitment to reinvigorate and modernize our alliances and partnerships around the world, which are critical and crucial to the security and prosperity of the American people. That's the message we've underscored earlier this week in our meetings with our counterparts in Japan. That's the message you see reflected in the joint statement that we signed and we'll release today.Our renewed engagement will put us on firmer footing to address a series of shared security challenges in the region and beyond, including the threat posed by North Korea. President Biden plans to complete a North Korea policy review in the weeks ahead in close coordination and consultation with the Republic of Korea, with Japan, with other key partners, including reviewing pressure options and potential for future diplomacy.But as we conveyed to the foreign minister and the defense minister, the goals of this policy are clear: We are committed to the denuclearization of North Korea, reducing the broader threat the DPRK poses to the United States and our allies, and improving the lives of all Koreans, including the people of North Korea who continue to suffer widespread and systematic abuses at the hands of their repressive government.We also discussed China. We are clear-eyed about Beijing's consistent failure to uphold its commitments and we spoke about how Beijing's aggressive and authoritarian behavior are challenging the stability, security, and prosperity of the Indo-Pacific region. Beijing's actions make forging a common approach among our allies all the more important at a time when we're seeing a rollback of democracy and human rights around the world, including in Burma, where the military is attempting to overturn the results of the democratic election by brutally repressing peaceful protesters.It is more important than ever that we stand together for the values, for the interests that unite us. And we covered a range of challenges that transcend borders, including cyber security, health security, climate change. At the time this alliance was forged, many of these threats were not even on the horizon, but they certainly are now, and we're determined to work together, particularly through trilateral cooperation among the United States, South Korea, and Japan to meet them. While our diplomacy and security ties are ironclad, I think it's also very clear that the U.S.-ROK relationship goes even deeper than that. It's rooted in mutual trust, in shared values, deeply intertwined economic interests, and, of course -- and maybe most important -- generations of family and community ties and having one another's back in the most difficult times.That's what we saw in the early days of the pandemic when the Republic of Korea donated two million face masks to our country to help us fill a critical shortfall. Five hundred thousand of those masks went to our Department of Veterans Affairs, which means that some Americans who 70 years earlier had fought side by side with Koreans found themselves protected from a deadly virus thanks to the masks donated by the Republic of Korea today. That is what an alliance looks like.Thank you, and it's really wonderful to be with you.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Minister Suh, please.DEFENSE MINISTER SUH (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Today, we have held the ROK-U.S. foreign and defense ministers meeting in five years. It was a great opportunity for us to reaffirm the rock-solid ROK-U.S. Alliance that has been growing in the last seven decades based on trust and commitment. We have appreciated the strong combined defense posture of the alliance based on the Mutual Defense Treaty, and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to the defense of Korea and extended deterrence.Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, we have successfully completed the Combined Command post training in the first half of this year and created the necessary conditions for OPCON transition in enhancement of the preparedness of the alliance. The alliance has made coordinated efforts to reach the conditions for a successful OPCON transition and agreed to continue to cooperate for OPCON transition. The ministers also agreed to closely communicate and cooperate to achieve common goals of complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and establishing permanent peace.We have also decided to continue the harmonious cooperation between the New Southern Policy of Korea and the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the U.S. for peace, stability, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific. The two ministers will continue to cooperate in a future oriented manner. Thank you.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Now, Secretary Austin, please.SECRETARY AUSTIN: Well, Minister Suh, Minister Chung, Secretary Blinken, it is a privilege to be here in Seoul with all of you.And first and foremost, as my colleagues have pointed out, I am also saddened by the horrific attacks in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday, where we believe several women of Korean descent were killed. Our deepest sympathies go out to all those affected by this horrific crime and specifically the families of those who were killed. And I share my colleague's view that violence of this type or any other type has no place in our society.Now today's meeting is a testament to the importance of our alliance. With the many challenges that we face, our bond, forged through shared sacrifice, is more important now than ever. For 70 years, the U.S. commitment to the U.S.-ROK Alliance has remained -- as Secretary Blinken described, has remained ironclad. It is founded on our shared interests and values and is among the strongest bilateral, interoperable, and dynamic alliances in the world. And it is critical not only to the security of the Republic of Korea and the United States, but also to the peace and stability of Northeast Asia and a free and open Indo-Pacific region.The United States remains fully committed to the defense of the Republic of Korea, using the full range of U.S. capabilities, including our extended deterrent. As the United States and the Republic of Korea continue to maintain a robust combined defense posture, we also remain committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. There is no daylight between us on this point.And today, we discussed the way forward on a host of critical strategic and operational issues. And at the top of my agenda was ensuring a shared understanding of the importance of maintaining military readiness. Our force remains ready to fight tonight and we continue to make progress toward the eventual transition of wartime operational control to an ROK-commanded future combined forces command.While meeting all the conditions for this transition will take more time, I am confident that this process will strengthen our alliance. And so we have a lot to look forward to as, together, we address global security -- the global security challenges and engage in long-term strategic competition, mainly with China, which, as some of you know, is our department's pacing challenge in the years ahead.Today, we continue to work together to identify areas for collaboration within our respective regional strategies, particularly upholding a rules-based international order and building capacity for partners in the region. I'm especially pleased with the initialing of the Special Measures Agreement, which reflects our commitment to this alliance and illustrate the Biden administration's promise to revitalize our network of alliances and partnerships. And so that is why we reaffirmed our commitment to the U.S.-ROK-Japan trilateral defense cooperation, because we recognize the value of multilateralism. And we value a forward-looking agenda to address both current and future shared challenges.Our work in today's foreign and defense ministerial meetings reflects our firm belief that leading with diplomacy backed by a strong combined defense posture and working closely with our allies and partners will allow us to meet every challenge and outmatch every competitor. It is why we place great value on the U.S.-ROK Alliance, which has remained the linchpin of peace, security, and prosperity in the Indo-Pacific for nearly three quarters of a century.We face many challenges together and we've risen to the occasion each time. And we are grateful to the call of the Republic of Korea, one of our closest friends and most steadfast partners, and I'm confident that our two countries will work to -- continue to work shoulder-to-shoulder to meet all challenges and any competitor for the next 70 years and beyond.As I said to Minister Suh in our meeting yesterday, we will continue to go together in the future. Thank you.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Next, we're going to have Q&A. Due to time constraint, as previously arranged, two journalists from the Korean and the U.S. sides will ask questions respectively. First, the Korean side. We have Mr. Hong Ju-hyeong from Segye Daily to ask a question.QUESTION (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Nice to meet you all. My name is Hong Ju-hyeong. I have two questions.First of all, North Korea policy -- this question goes to Minister Chung and Secretary Blinken: Do you believe that the U.S. needs to respect the Singapore agreement? Recently, Choe Son-hui of North Korea said that the difficult situations will continue unless U.S. stops its hostile policy to North Korea.The second question goes to global cooperation. Minister Chung, have you been asked to join Quad in this series of meetings? Secretary Blinken, do you believe Korea can contribute to the strengthening of Quad? And what kind of active engagement are you planning toward the ROK-U.S. Alliance?FOREIGN MINISTER CHUNG (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Let me answer the question first.Regarding North Korea policy, now the Singapore agreement, from the Korean Government's perspective, is a confirmation of fundamental principles to resolve the UK -- resolve the U.S.-North Korea relations, establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula, and denuclearization, though it needs to be considered seriously. Recently, Kim Yo-jong made a statement and Choe Son-hui made another statement today, and I am closely monitoring the situation. It seems North Korea is reviewing its policy toward the U.S., and it seems that North Korea is closely monitoring the dialogue between ROK and U.S. regarding North Korea policy. I believe it's their own way of sending messages to us and the U.S. Today, we briefly discussed on this issue. Now we will continue to closely coordinate on this issue with the U.S., and I support the Biden administration's efforts to engage North Korea, and hope that the talks will be resumed.On the visit of the secretaries from the U.S., there was no direct discussion about Korea joining Quad. However, we discussed how we can harmonize and coordinate the New Southern Policy of South Korea and the Indo-Pacific Strategy of the U.S. As I have stated several times, the Korean Government's position is that if it conforms with the national interest of Korea and transparency and inclusiveness is ensured, we can join any regional cooperative body.SECRETARY BLINKEN: Well, thank you very much for the question. I think as you know, with regard to North Korea, we're engaged in a comprehensive policy review, which we hope to complete in the weeks ahead. But what's significant about that review is it's being done in very close consultation with the Republic of Korea, with Japan, with other allies.We have a shared concern, a shared interest in having a strong, effective, and coordinated policy and proceeding together in lockstep. We're focused on reducing the threat to the United States, to our allies, posed by North Korea's nuclear program, its missile programs, and to improving the lives of people in North Korea, throughout the region as well. And we will continue to consult very closely in the weeks ahead as we complete the review.With regard to the Quad, I would just say it's -- I think as you know, it's an informal grouping of likeminded countries that have come together to deepen cooperation on a whole host of issues. Many of these issues we're also working very closely with the Republic of Korea. We find that working through some of these sub-regional groupings, including the trilateral, the work we do with Korea and Japan, is very beneficial in addressing some of the challenges we face.One of the -- one of the, I think, realities of the moment we're in is that when you consider virtually all of the issues that are actually affecting the lives of our people and of our citizens, whether it's climate, whether it's the pandemic, whether it's emerging technologies -- and I could go down the list -- not a single one can be effectively addressed by any one country acting alone. We have to find ways to deepen cooperation, to deepen coordination with likeminded countries. That's exactly what we've been doing with our close allies and partners here. It's what we do in our trilateral cooperation as well with Japan. It's what we do through the Quad. It's what we do through ASEAN.That is, I think, the imperative of the moment we're in. And we're very, very pleased that we've been able to do the work we've done here today because it's evidence of our determination to revitalize, to strengthen our alliances, to build on them, because that is the single best way to tackle the problems that actually affect the lives of our citizens.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you very much. Now, moving on to -- would like to receive the questions from the U.S. press.MR PRICE: The next question will go to Christina Ruffini of CBS.QUESTION: Good afternoon, gentlemen. Mr. Secretary, North Korea has so far not responded to U.S. attempts to engage, and as was just mentioned, today the vice minister of foreign affairs called such efforts a cheap trick and said U.S. calls for complete denuclearization were groundless rhetoric. When it comes to this policy review that you mentioned, given how far the two sides are apart, is the U.S. considering a policy of containment rather than engagement with North Korea? And will you be asking the Chinese to take any specific actions regarding Pyongyang when you meet in Alaska?And Mr. Foreign Minister, if I may, you said it appears North Korea is reevaluating its relationship with the U.S. Do you feel North Korea is more or less dangerous after the efforts of the previous administration, and have you asked Secretary Blinken to convey any message or request from your government to the Chinese? Thank you.SECRETARY BLINKEN: Thank you very much. Look, the -- with regard to North Korea, the most important outreach and engagement we're doing is with our partners and allies. That's a big part of the reason why we're here. It's a big part of the reason why, as part of the review that we're doing, we're in close consultation with the Republic of Korea, with Japan, with other allies and partners who are concerned by the actions and activities of North Korea. And I don't want to get ahead of the review and pre-judge its conclusion. We'll have an opportunity, I know, to talk about that going forward.China has a critical role to play in working to convince North Korea to pursue denuclearization. China has a unique relationship with North Korea. Virtually all of North Korea's economic relationships, its trade go -- are with or go through China, so it has tremendous influence. And I think it has a shared interest in making sure that we do something about North Korea's nuclear program and about the increasingly dangerous ballistic missile program.So I would hope that whatever happens going forward, China will use that influence effectively to work on moving North Korea to denuclearization.FOREIGN MINISTER CHUNG (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Since 2018 on the Korean Peninsula, the peace building, indeed reconciliation of these tensions have been fruitful, in my opinion, especially in September 2018. The Comprehensive Military Agreement between the two Koreas was a great achievement and meaningful, and that agreement is still the basis for both Koreas to be abiding by. So that should -- worthy of notice.For the last three years, the ROK and the U.S. have been maintaining close coordination, and based off of that, we have maintained our engagement policy with North Korea. And we believe that there is a possibility for us to have the denuclearization, and that has been proven in principle.Through the 2+2 meeting today, both the ROK and the U.S. demonstrated that we have the fully coordinated strategies and plans, and we decided to have further plans in the future. Based off of that, we can have the full and effective engagement with North Korea. Having said that, we believe that it's possible for us to have the full peace building in the Korean Peninsula.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you, Mr. Secretary, Mr. Minister Chung.Now the Korean side. Mr. Lee Seung-yun from YTN.QUESTION (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Good morning. I have two questions for Minister Suh. First, the U.S. is strengthening cooperation with Quad member-states. Was there any request from the U.S. for a combined military exercise with Quad members or intelligence sharing with the Quad members? Second, now the U.S. DOD is reviewing the USFK deployment posture. Did you have any discussion on that?(In English.) This question goes to Defense Secretary Austin. Welcome to South Korea.In order to strengthen national defense, the Korean Government wishes to build nuclear-powered submarine and a light aircraft carrier. Do you think that they will be feasible and essential assets for Korea-U.S. combined forces? And is the U.S. willing to help Korean Government to build nuclear-powered submarine?Second, although you emphasized the challenges posed by North Korea and China yesterday, China is still necessary to solve out the North Korean nuclear issues. So how would you cope with this dilemma? Maybe Secretary Blinken can answer for these questions, too. Thank you very much.DEFENSE MINISTER SUH (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Let me answer the question first. So the question about intelligence sharing or combined military exercise with Quad member-states, there is no such request from the U.S. We discussed measures to ensure stability in the Indo-Pacific and shared the understanding of the two sides, however there was no specific mentioning or a request on those issues you just raised.Regarding the military cooperation with the U.S., the U.S. discussed emerging security threats in our responses and stressed the necessary cooperation with the U.S., Japan, and Korea. Basically, Korea agrees that the trilateral cooperation is important. With the occasions of bilateral meetings and multilateral meetings, we will continue to cooperate with the U.S. in terms of military cooperation. And I believe Secretary Austin is better positioned to answer this part of the question.Now, the U.S. DOD is reviewing the USFK redeployment or repositioning. And we didn't discuss this issue specifically in this meeting. However, basically, the U.S. reaffirmed the importance of USFK in ensuring stability and peace in Northeast Asia, and U.S. commitment to the defense of Korea is steadfast.SECRETARY AUSTIN: Yeah, so thanks. On the issue of nuclear submarines or any other capability that the Republic of Korea might seek to acquire, I think it's best that the leadership of the republic speak to that versus me. And so I'll leave it to Minister Suh to entertain those questions in the future.You should know, though, that we're focused on ensuring that we have the required capability to defend the alliance and to defend the ROK if and when called upon to do that. And our efforts to continue to work together routinely to strengthen our capability I think is evident in kind of everything we do. It's all -- it's what we really spent a lot of time talking about in the last two days.So we have tremendous capability at hand. We're going to increase that capability by ensuring that we can continue to operate as a combined team.SECRETARY BLINKEN: And I want to first commend you on demonstrating the art of the multi-party, multi-part question. (Laughter.)And again, with regard to Beijing, Beijing has an interest, a clear self-interest, in helping to pursue the denuclearization of the DPRK, because it is a source of instability, it's a source of danger, and obviously a threat to us and our partners. But China has a real interest in helping to deal with this.It also has an obligation under the UN Security Council resolutions to implement fully the sanctions that the international community has agreed are there in response to North Korea's program and to its provocations. So we look to Beijing to play a role in advancing what is in, I think, everyone's interest.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you very much. Now the last question, back to the U.S. press.MR PRICE: The final question will to go Lara Seligman of Politico.QUESTION: Good afternoon, gentlemen.Secretary Austin, you spoke about the importance of maintaining military readiness. For the past three years, the joint military drills between South Korea and the United States have been downsized due to ongoing negotiations over North Korea's nuclear arsenal. What impact has that had on readiness? And do you plan to continue the smaller-scale exercises in future, or will they return to their former size and scope?Secretary Blinken, if I may: As has been mentioned, North Korea's vice minister of foreign affairs said today that there would be no dialogue until the United States drops what she called its ""hostile policy."" Can I get you to respond directly to that? And by insisting from the start that the end state is its complete denuclearization, aren't you closing the door to talks and setting the stage for four years of stalemate?And finally, if I may, for Minister Chung: The U.S. delegation has repeatedly called for the denuclearization of North Korea -- specifically North Korea, not the Korean Peninsula. So does the Government of South Korea back this call rather than the Korean Peninsula? Or can I have you just to respond to that, please?SECRETARY AUSTIN: Well, thanks, Lara. I'll start, and the question was training and readiness. And as you would expect, for me and for everyone that works with me and for me, readiness remains a top priority. And I know that that is a top priority for our teammates here in the republic as well. And so we're always looking for ways to make training better, and I think not only here but around the globe we've learned to be flexible, we've learned to be adaptive, and we have always, always been effective.In terms of whether or not -- what the training regimen will be going forward, that will be a joint decision between us and the ROK, and we'll continue to work with the leadership here in the ROK to address those issues.SECRETARY BLINKEN: And Lara, with regard to the comments from North Korea, I'm aware of them. But what I'm most interested in right now are the comments and thoughts of our allies and partners, which is why we're here, as we complete our review. So that's what we're focused on.FOREIGN MINISTER CHUNG (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Yes. Regarding the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was the result of the agreement of the denuclearization of the -- both Koreas. And also because of that we have the manufacturing and positioning and seven very concrete measures of denuclearization measures that have been under that agreement. And also, that means that we are quite having the very sure definition of the denuclearization in the Korean Peninsula, and also the nuclear weapons will not be owned by -- as according to our declaration. And that was the declaration we made.When we talk about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it means that to the North Korea we are showing that South Korea has been already denuclearized. And also, according to the agreement made in 1995, we are suggesting North Korea that we have to go along together, and the North Korea is fully aware of that as well.And the international community, rather than talking about the denuclearization of the North Korea, if we can say the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, we are very much more confident that we can convince the North Korea to follow our suit. So I believe that it is more correct to say that it is about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.MODERATOR (THROUGH TRANSLATOR): Thank you very much.Now this concludes the joint press conference of the ROK-U.S. foreign and defense ministers meeting. Thank you very much.MSTRUCK-7424268 MSTRUCK","Secretary of Defense Austin III, Secretary of State Blinken Conduct Press Conference With Their Counterparts After U.S.-ROK Foreign, Defense Ministerial, Hosted by ROK's Foreign Minister Eui-yong, Minister of Defense Wook"
341,"Confused about inflation? You're not alone.
Inflation is, paradoxically, both incredibly simple to understand and absurdly complicated.
Let's start with the simplest version: Inflation happens when prices broadly go up.
That ""broadly"" is important: At any given time, the price of goods will fluctuate based on shifting tastes. Someone makes a viral TikTok about brussels sprouts and suddenly everyone's gotta have them; sprouts prices go up. Meanwhile sellers of cauliflower, last season's trendy veg, are practically giving their goods away. Those fluctuations are constant.
Inflation is when the average price of virtually everything consumers buy goes up. Food, houses, cars, clothes, toys, etc. To afford those necessities, wages have to rise too.
It's not a bad thing. In the United States, for the past 40 years or so (and particularly this century), we've been living in an ideal low-and-slow level of inflation that comes with a well-oiled consumer-driven economy, with prices going up around 2% a year, if that. Sure, prices on some things, like housing and health care, are much higher than they used to be, but other things, like computers and TVs, have become much cheaper — the average of all the things combined has been relatively stable.
Still with me?
All right, let's cut to today, and why inflation is all over the news.
When 'inflation' is a bad word
Inflation becomes problematic when that low-and-slow simmer gets fired up to a boil. That's when you hear economists talk about the economy ""overheating."" For a variety of reasons, largely stemming from the pandemic, the global economy finds itself at a rigorous boil right now.
In the United States, prices have climbed 6.2% — the biggest increase since November 1990, and well above the Federal Reserve's long-term inflation goal of around 2%.
And here's where Econ 101 merges a bit with Psych 101. There's a behavioral economics aspect to inflation where it can become a self-fulfilling prophecy. When prices go up for a long enough period of time, consumers start to anticipate the price increases. You'll buy more goods today if you think they'll cost appreciably more tomorrow. That has the effect of increasing demand, which causes prices to rise even more. And so on. And so on.
That's where it can get especially tricky for the Federal Reserve, whose main job is to control money supply and keep inflation in check.
How'd we get here?
Blame the pandemic.
In the spring of 2020, as Covid-19 spread, it was like pulling the plug on the global economy. Factories around the world shut down; people stopped going out to restaurants; airlines grounded flights. Millions of people were laid off as business disappeared practically overnight. The unemployment rate in America shot up to nearly 15% from about 3.5% in February 2020.
It was the sharpest economic contraction on record.
By early summer, however, demand for consumer goods started to pick back up. Rapidly. Congress and President Joe Biden passed a historic $1.9 trillion stimulus bill in March that made Americans suddenly flush with cash and unemployment assistance. People started shopping again. Demand went from zero to 100, but supply couldn't bounce back so easily.
When you pull the plug on the global economy, you can't just plug it back in and expect it start humming at the same pace as before.
Take cars, for example. Automakers saw the Covid crisis beginning and did what any smart business would do — shut down temporarily and try to mitigate losses. But not long after the pandemic shut factories down, it also drove up demand for cars as people worried about exposure on public transit and avoided flying. Automakers had whiplash.
Cars require an immense number of parts, from an immense number of different factories around the world, to be built by highly skilled laborers in other parts of the world. Getting all of those discreet operations back online takes time, and doing so while keeping workers from getting sick takes even more time.
Economists often describe inflation as too much money chasing too few goods. That's exactly what happened with cars. And houses. And Peloton bikes. And any number of other items that became hot ticket items.
How's the supply chain involved in all this?
""Supply chain bottlenecks"" — that's another one you see all over, right?
Let's go back to the car example.
We know that high demand + limited supply = prices go up.
But high demand + limited supply + production delays = prices go up even more.
All modern cars rely on a variety of computer chips to function. But those chips are also used in cellphones, appliances, TVs, laptops and dozens of other items that, as bad luck would have it, were all in high demand at the same time.
That's just one example of the disconnect in the global supply chain. Because new cars have been slow to roll in, used car demand shot through the roof, which drove overall inflation higher. In some cases, car owners were able to sell their used cars for more than what they paid for them a year or two prior.
What happens next?
Prices and wages are likely to keep going up well into 2022, officials and economists say. But for how long and how much depends on countless variables across the globe.
Policymakers' top priority is to unclog the supply chain bottlenecks to get goods moving at their pre-pandemic pace. That's a lot easier said than done. And there's no telling what kind of shocks — a resurgent Covid variant, a massive shipping container getting stuck in a key waterway, a natural disaster — could set back progress.
Economists and investors in the United States expect that the Fed will tighten monetary policy by raising interest rates and dialing back emergency stimulus, thereby slow the pace of inflation. When money becomes more expensive to borrow, that can take the heat off price increases and bring the economy back down to that nice, gentle simmer.
By Allison Morrow, CNN Business","Inflation, explained: Why prices keep going up and who's to blame"
342,"Dec. 4 - Cameron Heyward missed Pittsburgh Steelers practice Friday because of an illness, but according to the league-mandated official game status report, the star defensive tackle remains on track to play in Sunday's game.
Heyward and fellow defensive lineman Isaiahh Loudermilk were listed on the official injury report as absent from Friday's final practice of the week because of ""illness."" But neither was placed on the NFL's covid-19 list, a move that would have been required if either had tested positive.
Heyward (like Loudermilk) was not given a status designation (i.e., ""out"", ""questionable"" or ""doubtful""), which, by league rules, indicates each will play Sunday against the rival Baltimore Ravens.
Teams, however, can update their game status report for injuries/illnesses over the weekend, with the caveat that it ""must be reported immediately if the injury or event could affect a player's ability to play in that week's game."" The NFL got rid of its ""probable"" designation in 2016.
There is a 4 p.m. Saturday deadline for roster moves, but the pandemic compelled the league to add an exception: A team can elevate a player from its practice squad up until 90 minutes before kickoff if there is a positive covid-19 test.
What that means is Heyward, in theory, could test positive in the 24 hours before Sunday's game. A high-profile example of such a scenario was last month when the evening before a game the Steelers announced that of quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.
In contrast to the Steelers, three Ravens players who had illnesses and did not practice Friday were given the ""questionable"" designation: cornerbacks Malon Humprey and Travon Young and outside linebacker Jaylon Ferguson. A former All-Pro, Humphrey did not practice Thursday or Friday.
It might be worth noting Heyward wore a mask during Thursday's media availability, which is not mandated by protocol and something Heyward had not done for more than a dozen prior interviews this season.
Also of some note in light of the Heyward illness: New teammate Montravius Adams said Friday that Heyward, a defensive captain, this week took all the defensive linemen out ""off site"" to dinner and to get treatment.
Three players were on the Steelers' covid list Friday evening: linebackers T.J. Watt and Robert Spillane and offensive lineman Joe Haeg.
Heyward has been carrying the load of a depleted defensive line that has been without its other starters (Stephon Tuitt and Tyson Alualu) virtually all season. With Isaiah Buggs (ankle injury) out Sunday and Carlos Davis still on injured reserve, the Steelers could play Sunday without any of the top six defensive linemen they had on their roster at the start of camp.
Davis, though, is a candidate to be activated off IR. He has been practicing the past 2  1/2  weeks. The Steelers defensive line group could be Henry Mondeaux and the newly-signed Adams from the active roster and Daniel Archibong and Khalil Davis off the practice squad.
A two-time defensive player of the year finalist, Watt went on the covid list Monday. It is still possible Watt could be placed on the active roster by the 4 p.m. Saturday deadline. Players must test negative on consecutive days and be symptom-free for 48 hours before they can re-join their team.
The irony of the Steelers playing the Ravens at Heinz Field without some important starters because of covid is that it was 53 weeks ago the teams played on a Wednesday afternoon with star Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson and more than a dozen other Ravens players on the covid list.

345,"If Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys are going to see Tom Brady again this season, as the star quarterback boldly told the seven-time champ, they’re going to have to change recent history. Some older stuff, too.
Those were Prescott’s parting words after Brady led the Buccaneers to the winning field goal in the final seconds of a 31-29 victory for the defending Super Bowl champions in the opener.
The Cowboys missed the playoffs the past two seasons, in large part last year because of the ankle injury that ended Prescott’s season in Week 5. They haven’t been the NFC championship game since the last of the franchise’s five Super Bowl titles 26 years ago.
“I think I told everybody we’d see them again and that’s just the confidence that I have in this group,” Prescott said. “The expectations I have is this is a playoff team that is going to make a big push this year.”
Prescott had a remarkable return 11 months after the injury, going 42 of 58 for 403 yards and three touchdowns when it was clear the Cowboys didn’t think Ezekiel Elliott would be able to do much against last year’s No. 1 run defense.
Dallas forced four turnovers, but the defense couldn’t get the key stop late. That’s what has helped keep the Cowboys out of the playoffs, and from going deeper in the postseason when they were good enough to reach it in recent years.
“We got to make sure young guys mix in with the old guys and I think we got a chance to be a really good defense,” rookie linebacker Micah Parsons said. “There was some people that have never played in this defense before until today, so I think we can build off this week and then go on to next week and get even better.”
WHAT’S WORKING
Barring injury, the Cowboys have will have one of the best receiving groups in the league. Amari Cooper and CeeDee Lamb combined for 20 catches, 243 yards and three touchdowns. Drops are the only concern. Lamb was among the league leaders as a rookie last year and had a costly one on Dallas’ opening drive. A daring throw over the middle later in the game went through Lamb’s hands, resulting in Prescott’s only interception.
WHAT NEEDS HELP
Coach Mike McCarthy thought Brady getting rid of the ball quickly kept the Cowboys from getting pressure on him. Regardless, the first chance for DeMarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory to get most of the snaps as a pass rushing pair was a bit of a dud.
STOCK UP
Connor McGovern probably made the Cowboys feel better about their depth in the offensive line after filling in nicely for four-time All-Pro RG Zack Martin, who was out after testing positive for COVID-19. Prescott was sacked once. It was hard to gauge the run blocking because Dallas didn’t do enough of it. Elliott had just 11 carries for 33 yards.
STOCK DOWN
K Greg Zuerlein missed most of the preseason coming off back surgery, and it showed. He badly missed a 31-yard field goal early, then an extra point. While he was perfect on a 48-yarder for a one-point lead with 1:24 remaining, doubts are going to linger about his consistency without much chance to get “Greg the Leg” in football shape.
INJURIES
WR Michael Gallup, the third option behind Cooper and Lamb, injured an ankle against the Buccaneers and was walking with a slight limp after the game. ... Martin, who tested positive five days before the opener, should have enough time to recover before the next game, Sept. 19 at the Los Angeles Chargers.
KEY NUMBER
400-plus, 1-3 — Prescott has thrown for at least 400 yards in his past four full games. Yet the Cowboys have a 1-3 record. The averages are astounding: 38½ completions on 55 attempts (70% completion rate), 457 yards, almost three touchdowns per game. Dallas just isn’t getting enough defense to go with it.
NEXT STEPS
The schedule gets easier, as expected after opening against the defending champs. The Chargers will be tricky, though, after such a strong rookie year from quarterback Justin Herbert. Dallas figures to be favored the three games after the LA visit, but an 0-2 start will only increase the anxiety coming off a 6-10 season in McCarthy’s less-than-stellar debut. And now there’s more instability in the offensive line with right tackle La’el Collins suspended five games for violating the NFL’s substance-abuse policy.

346,"
MIAMI - The Caleb Countdown is over.
Operating over the first half of the season amid concern about the playing-time limitation on the two-way contract of emerging forward Caleb Martin, the Miami Heat no longer face such apprehensions.
A package of NBA rules adjustments on the personnel side amid heightened coronavirus worries has removed the restriction on the number of games a player on a two-way contract can be on the active roster.
Under the previous rules, Martin would have been limited to 50 of the regular season's 82 games on the active roster.
Having already been active for 24 games, the clock no longer is ticking for Martin, a clock that could have expired at the end of January. Instead, once the third-year forward reaches 50 games on the active roster, his salary for all remaining such games will be paid at the rate for standard contracts. Two-way contracts pay half standard scale.
Because of their roster status, operating at 14 players on standard contract, one below the NBA limit, the Heat had been limited to a total of 90 total games on the active roster for their two two-way players. That restriction now has been removed, which also will allow for unlimited appearances for undrafted rookie guard Marcus Garrett, the Heat's other two-way prospect.
According to the revised two-way agreement, two-way players will not be playoff eligible unless converted to a standard contract by season's end. For the Heat, that could be as basic as converting Martin to a standard contract the final day of the regular season, provided they continue to retain an open roster spot.
In addition, the NBA has notified teams that players signed to 10-day emergency contracts as replacements for those entering health-and-safety protocols no longer will count against a team's salary cap or luxury tax.
Had such a rule been in place when Martin entered protocols, the Heat could have added an additional player on such a contract.
Among players who recently have been signed to such emergency 10-day contracts are former Heat players Tyler Johnson, with the Philadelphia 76ers, and James Ennis, with the Brooklyn Nets.
The safety net of such contracts not counting against the tax and cap leaves open the option of the Heat adding a 15th player on their standard roster in March without moving into the punitive luxury tax.
Spoelstra added
Heat coach Erik Spoelstra on Monday formally was named to USA Basketball's coaching staff for the National Team that will compete in the World Cup in 2023 and the 2024 Paris Olympics.
Spoelstra will serve as an assistant on the staff of Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr alongside Phoenix Suns coach Monty Williams and Gonzaga coach Mark Few.
Spoelstra coached USA Basketball's Select Team that trained against Team USA in July ahead of the Tokyo Olympics, placing him as a potential front-runner to coach Team USA in the 2028 Los Angeles Olympics.
""I'm also beyond excited to work with three coaches I have enormous respect for in Erik Spoelstra, Monty Williams and Mark Few,"" Kerr said in conjunction with Monday's announcement. ""Coaching the USA Men's National Team comes with great responsibility - one that calls for a group effort with a team of coaches committed to the team, to the goal and to each other - and I couldn't ask for a finer group of high character individuals to help me lead our national team. Our goal, of course, is to win and make our country proud. We will work hard to do so.""
Spoelstra is in his 14th season as an NBA coach, all with the Heat, the winningest coach in franchise history. He has guided the Heat to two NBA championships, five conference titles, seven division titles and 10 postseason appearances, having never missed the playoffs in consecutive seasons.
Status quo
The Heat said Tuesday that their COVID rules for attendance at FTX Arena remain status quo, including the requirement of wearing a mask when not actively eating or drinking. Added vigilance is expected with those seated close to the court.

347,"It's been a trip two years in the making, but it's finally happening on Tuesday.
The Gibson County Mass Band, made of band members from five high schools in Gibson County (Gibson County, South Gibson County, Humboldt, Peabody and Milan), will board an airplane and head for Southern California for about a week.
While there, the band will play a parade at Disney Land and will also march in the Tournament of Roses Parade.
Jeremy Tate is the band director at Gibson County High School and is the coordinator for the entire trip that was supposed to happen last year but was postponed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""There's still a lot going on with coordinating the trip and talking with different people associated with the trip,"" Tate said when asked about how much was happening in the week leading up to the trip. ""I'm very thankful for the fact that the other band directors from the other four schools are very much involved in the planning and coordination because this wouldn't have happened without teamwork among all of us and a number of other people, and I'm glad we've put in the work as a band to really refine our performance because we're not practicing again until we're there.""
Tate said all of the bands have balanced work with the Mass Band and work with their own bands throughout the fall to prepare for this performance, and based on what he saw the last three weekends during Saturday rehearsals, he's looking forward to seeing how well the band performs on national television Saturday.
Fundraising
With 250 bandmembers and 237 others flying in an airplane, staying in hotels and doing things like going to Disneyland, the total cost of the trip is $1.3 million.
With such a lofty price tag, Tate divided that total by each of the 487 people making the trip, which equals a little more than $2,600 per person.
""We set out fundraising, and we opened an account with the travel company for each person where they had to reach that $2,600 goal,"" Tate said. ""And some folks are blessed enough that they were able to write a check and their part of the trip was paid for, but not everyone had that ability.
""So we had various fundraisers to help everyone reach that goal.""
That goal was met and the final payment was made by its due date of Dec. 1 that allows everyone to make the trip, which includes about 10 band members who graduated in May, were supposed to go last year but still wanted to go this year.
""Fortunately we were able to give last year's seniors that option to come with us if they wanted and were able,"" Tate said. ""And I think 10 were able to, but I know it was difficult for more to do it because that first semester of college is chaotic as you're figuring college out.
""So a lot of others that wanted to weren't able to take part in fundraising activities. But a few were, so they're coming along with some members of this year's high school freshman class.""
Working toward the parade
One advantage of the postponement is the Mass Band got a chance to do some extra work to prepare.
They got some practices in together in the spring and actually marched in the West Tennessee Strawberry Festival Parade in Humboldt in May when the president of the Tournament of Roses Parade was in town to officially invite the band to the January parade in Pasadena, Calif.
""What we performed in the Strawberry Festival is what we'll perform next week, so that gave us a great opportunity to establish a good starting point there,"" Tate said.
After the Strawberry Festival, the Mass Band didn't do any combined work through the summer or fall as each of the bands had their own annual obligations throughout this past semester with football halftime performances on Friday nights and band competitions on Saturdays.
""We took a break for a week after state championships for band in November and all came together on Nov. 15 to begin practicing together,"" Tate said.
Every Saturday in December was a full day of work for the band. They met at Johnnie Hale Stadium in Milan and worked in the morning on the field's artificial turf in the mornings, took a break for lunch and then practiced marching for the parade that is 5.5 miles long through the streets of Milan from the stadium to the middle school, practiced marching past the cameras for the broadcast and making sure everyone was prepared for the two-hour performance.
""I don't think that's a concern, but we'll have plenty of time to practice leading up to the parade and performing at Disney will help us get used to the dryer air out there, which will affect us and the instruments,"" Tate said.
Full schedule
The band is set to leave from Trenton early Monday morning with a full itinerary set until they return home late the following Sunday night.
Mornings are met with a wake-up call around 6 a.m. most days, but earlier on New Year's since the parade is in the morning. After a couple of hours of practice, the band is set to enjoy lunch and an afternoon and evening of enjoying the sights and sounds of Southern California before lights out at curfew time between 10 and 11 p.m., depending on what's scheduled for the day.
""Of course, we're making this trip for the Tournament of Roses Parade, but everything else we get to do will be special for these kids,"" Tate said. ""The other day during one of our practices, I asked them how many had never flown in a plane or seen the ocean or been to Disney or stayed in a hotel.
""And about 75 percent of them raised their hands saying they never had done at least one of those things. And that's what this trip is partly about – making memories and having experiences they might not have had otherwise. I remember the first time I flew in a plane or saw the ocean, and a lot of these kids will have that because of this trip. And hopefully it will be a great one they'll all return from next weekend with great memories from to look back on for the rest of their lives.""

348,"It did not take long for J.R. Konieczny to figure out Blake Wesley was a special talent. They were in second grade, playing for the APA Select travel team out of South Bend.
""He stood out, for sure,"" Konieczny said. ""His quickness, his athleticism, just the way he was able to play defense really stood out. He's been able to carry that with him ever since and he's still one of the best defenders I've ever seen.""
After years of playing together, then against each other in high school, Konieczny and Wesley are again on the same team this week with the Indiana All-Stars. It is a special week for the seniors from South Bend, who will continue their friendship as teammates at Notre Dame.
It was not necessarily destined that way. The 6-7 Konieczny lived in LaPorte until his seventh-grade year, when his family moved to South Bend. He attended a few football and basketball games at Notre Dame and coach Mike Brey had Konieczny on his radar even before high school. ""But Notre Dame never really stood out to me until I got the offer,"" Konieczny said.
When he did, in the summer before his junior season, the South Bend St. Joseph star jumped on it over offers from Butler, Creighton, Iowa and others. That is when Konieczny turned up the volume on his old buddy, Wesley, a 6-5 standout across town at South Bend Riley.
""It's kind of funny,"" Konieczny said. ""We got the offer on the same day of the (NCAA Basketball Academy in Champaign, Ill., in July of 2019) and we were kind of talking, joking around like, 'What if we both stayed home.' Every single time I'd see him after that it was like, 'OK man, when are you going to commit?'""
Wesley held off until November of his senior year before making a commitment to the Fighting Irish, giving Brey a four-star prospect in the 2021 class (he is ranked No. 111 in the country on the 247sports composite). Wesley, a player many believe has the most NBA potential of any in-state prospect in the class, picked Notre Dame over Creighton, Maryland and Xavier.
Like Konieczny, Wesley was not necessarily sold on the idea of staying home for college.
""I wasn't thinking 'hometown hero' when they first offered me,"" Wesley said. ""I wasn't thinking about that. But then when I started narrowing down my schools, I started thinking about family and what was going to be the best fit for me. And that's why I chose Notre Dame. I've got my grandparents there, my cousins there. It will be nice for them to come to the games.""
There is, too, the connection between the players that led them to Notre Dame. Konieczny, the leading scorer in the history of St. Joseph County with 1,996 points, and Wesley, who averaged 27.1 points and 6.1 rebounds as a senior, seem to have strengths that will play well off the other.
""You're looking at a future NBA player, for sure,"" Konieczny said of Wesley. ""There are things he's able to do with his athleticism and defense that people are going to be looking at him like, 'Wow, he can really do things on the court that a lot of other people can't do.' He wants to go out there and play defense. He wants to guard the best player. He has that guard mentality that a lot of people lack. I think he's going to carry that with him for long time.""
Konieczny figures to give Notre Dame a perimeter shooting threat right away. He was 34.9% shooter from the 3-point line as a senior. But Wesley warns that Konieczny is more than a shooter, picking him as a potential winner if the Indiana All-Stars had a dunk contest.
""J.R. is a great player,"" Wesley said. ""He can shoot, he can dunk. He's 6-8 and it looks easy. He's definitely a great player. We're a great duo together. That's what I saw when I committed to Notre Dame. I saw what we could do together. He's a catch-and-shoot player but also can finish. I can mostly do the same things. But I definitely see him going there and starting.""
Notre Dame, coming off a 11-15 season, will be looking for the freshmen to contribute. Konieczny and Wesley will get to work soon enough, moving to campus on Sunday — the day after the second of the two Indiana All-Stars games against Kentucky.

349,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, March 5 -- Edward C. Freni, director of aviation at the Massachusetts Port Authority, East Boston, has issued a public comment on the Federal Aviation Administration notice entitled ""Overview of FAA Aircraft Noise Policy and Research Efforts: Research Activities to Inform Aircraft Noise Policy"". The comment was written on March 2, 2021, and posted on March 3, 2021:* * *On behalf of the Massachusetts Port Authority (Massport), we are submitting this comment letter to the FAA's Federal Register Notice ""Overview of FAA Aircraft Noise Policy and Research Efforts: Request for Input on Research Activities to Inform Aircraft Noise Policy"" (Docket No. FAA-20210037) and to provide our perspective on the FAA's research portfolio on noise and air emissions including the recent issuance of the Neighborhood and Environmental Survey (NES).Massport and the FAA have a strong, historic partnership in collaborating on environmental research and in implementing one of the oldest and most successful airport noise mitigation and sound treatment programs in the nation. The most recent example of this collaboration is the ongoing Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between Massport and the FAA that leverages current research by the FAA's Aviation Sustainability Center (ASCENT) and MIT. The focus of the MOU is to identify and evaluate opportunities to reduce the noise impacts of the FAA's nationwide rollout of Performance-Based Navigation (PBN) procedures at Boston Logan International Airport (Boston Logan).Given the uncertainty facing the aviation industry due to the COVID-19 crisis, Massport appreciates the FAA's decision to ""not make any determinations based on the findings of these research programs for the FAA's noise policies, including any potential revised use of the Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) noise metric, until it has carefully considered public and other stakeholder input ... ""/1As the aviation industry recovers and returns to growth, we believe that a critical part of our success and that of our airline partners is to continue this important research. The results are expected to benefit communities in close proximity to airports, through more efficient flight operations, reduced noise, and an overall reduction of aviation's impact on climate change.Massport fully supports the FAA's research related to noise and annoyance. The original Schultz Curve, which underpins the science of noise impacts, is based on research dating back to the 1970s. Although there has been additional research conducted in the U.S. and internationally, Massport welcomes the FAA's decision to update this work.The results of the NES indicate that today there is greater community sensitivity to noise energy then captured by the Schultz Curve. These findings were not a surprise to Massport given growing community engagement, even as the industry has realized significant reductions in noise and air emissions. At Boston Logan, for example, the 65 DNL contour has shrunk significantly as air carriers phased out stage 2, stage 3 hush-kitted, and older stage 3 aircraft. As a result, the number of people within the Boston Logan 65 DNL contour has dropped from over 100,000 in the 1980s to approximately 40,000 in the 1990s and fewer than 10,000 in 2019, while our passenger levels more than doubled.We are, however, surprised at the magnitude of the change from the Schultz Curve (from 12% highly annoyed to over 60% for people within the 65 DNL) and are interested in understanding the reasons for the significant changes. We request that the FAA analyze the survey data and methodology to be able to better describe the causes of the magnitude of the shift including broader trends: e.g. economic, demographics, use of social media, increased sensitivity to the environment, land use, and the advent of PBN procedures. A deeper analysis of the NES data may help better explain this shift and inform the type and effectiveness of policies that may be evaluated to further reduce aviation impacts over the long run. The additional information would also help airports discuss these new findings with our communities.Massport fully supports FAA's ongoing research related to noise, health impacts, sleep disturbance, and air emissions. We believe that the industry and the FAA are better served with informed research so that we can continue to accommodate growth while reducing our overall environmental footprint. This research will also help identify and target future industry efforts to address noise impacts while informing the public on the relative impact of aviation to the local environment and their daily lives.We also encourage the FAA to better integrate supplemental noise metrics beyond the DNL metric in its interactions with the public. Supplemental metrics often provide more easily understood measurements of noise than the DNL alone. The additional metrics offer opportunities to better communicate and visualize (through the use of enhanced, interactive mapping for example) proposed changes to the national airspace system.

351,"""There is already strong interest in the site. We have five, six people waiting to go through the building.""
Aidan Cleghorn
Partner with Syracuse, New York-based commercial real estate broker BellCornerstone, which is handling the marketing and sale of The Courier Journal building
It has been filled over seven decades with reporters, editors, photographers, designers, salespeople, press operators, executives, custodians and countless other employees.
It has been the site of a mass shooting in the '80s and the target of an angry mob protesting the newspaper's support of school busing in the '70s.
It has welcomed visitors through its historic front entrance and up to its fourth-floor newsroom, including some rather unexpected guests, including a buffalo.
It has played host to long nights, passionate arguments, joyful celebrations (including for more than a half-dozen Pulitzers), welcome gatherings for new staff and emotional departures.
Now, nearly 75 years after it was built, The Courier Journal's home at 525 W. Broadway is up for sale.
The property, with its Streamline Moderne architecture, was constructed in 1947 on the north side of Broadway between Fifth and Sixth streets at the edge of downtown Louisville.
The building went on the market Friday with a listing price of $17 million, according to Aidan Cleghorn, a partner with Syracuse, New York-based commercial real estate broker BellCornerstone, which is handling the marketing and sale of The Courier Journal building.
""There is already strong interest in the site,"" Cleghorn said. ""We have five, six people waiting to go through the building.""
Irby-Jones: Sale won't affect
Courier Journal publishing
The building has been largely devoid of Courier Journal staff the past year, with the COVID-19 pandemic necessitating a work-from-home schedule.
In March, the printing presses for Kentucky's largest newspaper fell silent, with Courier Journal newspapers now getting printed and trucked in each day from Indianapolis.
The sale of its building is just the latest change for the 153-year-old paper, with parent company Gannett putting other newspaper buildings up for sale around the country in recent months.
Despite the sale, the newsroom staff will continue publishing online and in print as normal as The Courier Journals explores other property options downtown, Executive Editor Mary Irby-Jones said.
""We are committed to Louisville and Kentucky, and the sale of the building will not change how we cover our communities, region and state,"" Irby-Jones said.
Cleghorn concurred the newsroom likely would remain in the city's center. For the roughly $100 million worth of Gannett property that Bell Cornerstone helped sell last year, and the couple dozen news building this year, he said ""we have always kept them downtown.""
While the sale of a newspaper's building oftentimes brings with it concerns about the ""end of a newspaper,"" Cleghorn said that is not the case.
""In reality, these buildings are massive, (and) they're extraordinarily expensive to maintain,"" Cleghorn said.
Focusing on a digital audience
The building is roughly 660,000 square feet and has eight stories, though Cleghorn said the ""usable square footage for the buyer is going to be much less than that.""
Tours and the normal sales process likely will commence by the last week of April, Cleghorn said, and he thinks any sale will probably be completed by spring 2022. Portions of the building, such as the now-quiet printing area, could be knocked down depending on what a buyer wishes to do with the space, Cleghorn said, noting his Apple Watch recorded roughly 2.5 miles when he walked through  the entire building.
""Gannett and Bell are working with a local architect to determine the exact amount of usable square feet,"" Cleghorn said. ""I still think it will be north of half a million.""
Gannett, based in McLean, Virginia, is the parent company of USA TODAY and more than 260 other local daily news outlets in the U.S.
Declining print advertising revenue combined with corporate consolidation has rocked the media industry and killed off hundreds of newspapers in the 21st century. In response, Gannett and other publishers have focused on growing their digital audiences and subscriptions to remain viable.
""By rightsizing and getting into a new space, it saves a lot of money"" and puts The Courier Journal in a place more in line with today's modern, fast-paced world of news, Cleghorn said.
""We want to get you into a nice, new, modern, techy space that feels like what you're doing,"" he said.
""There is already strong interest in the site. We have five, six people waiting to go through the building.""

353,"Ben Milligan waited three years to compete in an outdoor track and field meet and the Oregon senior made it a memorable return.
Milligan set a two-inch personal best in the high jump with a clearance of 7 feet, 4 1/2 inches last Saturday at the SDSU Aztec Invitational and in the process took over second-place all-time in the school record book.
On Wednesday, Milligan was named the Pac-12 Conference field athlete of the week for his performance.
He wasn't the only Duck honored, as redshirt freshman sprinter Xavier Nairne was named the Pac-12 track athlete of the week.
Nairne ran in three events at the Aztec Invitational, first anchoring the Ducks' 4x100-meter relay to victory in 39.02 seconds, a time which ranks fourth in Oregon history and fifth in the NCAA this season.
He broke a 38-year-old meet record in the 100 with a PR time of 10.20 seconds, which leads the Pac-12, ranks sixth nationally, and moves him to No. 6 on Oregons all-time list.
He then placed third in the 200 in a PR 20.73.
Milligan was competing outdoors for the first time since the 2018 NCAA championship meet. He missed 2019 because of a season-ending knee injury, then had his 2020 season canceled due to COVID-19.
His previous PR was 7-2 1/2 from the 2018 regular season. He came up short Saturday during his three attempts at the school record of 7-5, set by Jason Boness in 2000.
Milligan is entered in the high jump Saturday during the final day of the Hayward Premiere meet, which will mark the grand opening of the $200 million remodel of Hayward Field. Nairne is not entered in an individual event.
The Ducks haven't hosted a meet since the 2018 NCAA championships.

357,"The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization issued the following news:The 34th session of FAO's Committee on Fisheries (COFI34) ended its week-long meeting on Friday with its Members endorsing the first-ever Declaration for Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture, urging stronger action to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing, and stressing the importance of recovering from impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.The Declaration outlines a global vision for fisheries and aquaculture, while highlighting the sector's essential contributions in the fight against poverty, hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This is central to efforts to implement the 2030 Agenda and make agri-food systems more inclusive, resilient and sustainable, a global concern that will be discussed at the UN Food Systems Summit, in September.In her closing remarks on the last day of COFI34, FAO Deputy-Director General, Maria Helena Semedo, said fisheries and aquaculture were of critical importance for global agri-food systems transformation.""We all share a common goal - the sustainable management of our valuable aquatic resources,"" Semedo said. ""This is vital to having better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life for all so that, together, we can achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.""The Declaration builds upon existing international instruments aimed at promoting sustainable fisheries and aquaculture around the world, such as the landmark FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, recognizing successes since the endorsement of the Code and identifying new and urgent priorities.COFI34 marked the 25th anniversary of the Code with a High-level Special Event. Since its adoption in 1995, the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries has been the main instrument for developing international agreements, guidelines and tools to ensure the effective conservation, management, utilization and production of living aquatic resources.In 2018, global fisheries and aquaculture production (excluding aquatic plants) reached an all time record of nearly 179 million tonnes. Overall capture fisheries, with 96.4 million tonnes represented 54 percent of the total, while aquaculture, with 82.1 million tonnes, accounted for 46 percent.The 2020 State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (SOFIA) report estimates that total fish production is set to increase to 204 million tonnes in 2030, up 15 percent from 2018, with aquaculture's share growing from its current 46 percent to 53 percent. Aquaculture has been the fastest expanding food production sector globally over the last decades, growing at an average of 5.3 percent per year since the turn of the century.FAO estimates that 34.2 percent of all marine fish stocks are fished beyond biological sustainable limits, a threefold increase since monitoring started in 1974.IUU fishingAt COFI34, Members acknowledged the need for greater monitoring and transparency in fishing operations, and noted further efforts were needed to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Countries were urged to become a party to the FAO Agreement on Port State Measure (PSMA), considered a potent international instrument to combat IUU fishing.During COFI34, the Russian Federation announced it was becoming a Party to the PSMA, joining another 68 FAO Members including the European Union on behalf of its Member States, which have adhered to the Agreement since its adoption in 2009. Earlier this year, the United Kingdom also agreed to become a Party to the Agreement, following its departure from the EU.FAO confirmed that it would be further strengthening its $20 million Global Capacity Development Programme to support countries in enhancing their capacity to implement the PSMA and complementary international instruments. COVID-19 responseCOFI Members also requested that FAO supports fisherfolk communities affected by the pandemic through its COVID19 response and recovery programme .The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the fisheries and aquaculture sector through changing consumer demands, market access and logistical problems related to transportation and border restrictions.The report The impact of COVID-19 on fisheries and aquaculture food systems, featured during the COFI34, showed that fish supply, consumption and trade revenues for 2020 are all expected to have declined due to containment restrictions, while global aquaculture production is expected to fall by some 1.3 per cent, the first fall recorded by the sector in several years.The report also noted that global fisheries and aquaculture could face further disruption in 2021 as lockdowns affect supply and demand across the sector.COFI34 recognised the importance of the sustainable use of aquatic resources for biodiversity conservation. In addition, the meeting stressed the crucial need to improve data collection in the fisheries sector to support evidence-based decision making, especially in support of small-scale fishers, whose critical role will be celebrated during the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture in 2022.FAO is working with Duke University and WorldFish, a non-profit research organization, to assess the economic, environmental and social contribution of small-scale fisheries to food security, nutrition and development at global level.The next COFI session (COFI35) will be held from September 5-9 in 2022. The committee is the only global inter-governmental forum where FAO Members meet to consider issues and challenges facing fisheries and aquaculture.Fisheries and aquaculture will also be discussed at the World Ocean Summit in March, as well as the UN Climate Change Conference (COP26) in November and in the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP15) in December.MSTRUCK-7378878 MSTRUCK",FAO Members Endorse Declaration for Sustainable Fisheries and Aquaculture

BLOOMINGTON  A 2008 graduate of Normal Community High School, Andy Etheridge grew up attending basketball games at Illinois Wesleyans Shirk Center.
In a strange confluence of circumstances, Etheridge found himself in charge of the home team on Wednesday.
As IWUs acting head coach, Etheridge did not disappoint the Titans and they did not disappoint him in a 78-67 College Conference of Illinois and Wisconsin victory over Millikin.
The eighth-year IWU assistant was elevated to the top spot because head coach Ron Rose was home in COVID-19 quarantine. Etheridge took over a team ranked third nationally but was missing two starters and two key reserves for COVID concerns.
It was super rewarding, Etheridge said after the Titans improved to 10-2 and 3-1 in the CCIW. The guys were awesome. They competed and fought like crazy. It was mental toughness across the board.
""It was truly a testament to Coach Rose and the program hes built having something like this happen and being able to sustain what we do. 
Etheridge was appreciative of the encouragement offered to him by IWU alumni.
The alums were awesome how theyve been supporting me. Im very grateful for that, he said. Its really special to be part of this Titan family.
Here are more takeaways from a memorable night at Shirk Center.
Saints alive
The matchup of the evening was IWU junior Luke Yoder against Millikin freshman JT Welch. The guards are former teammates at Central Catholic High School.
It was fun playing him for the first time. I always played with him and never against him, Yoder said. It was cool. Hes a good player, and hes going to get a lot better.
Yoder finished with 18 points, a career-high seven rebounds and three steals.
Welch was intimately familiar with his surroundings at Shirk Center.
I was running around here as a little guy. I practiced and played here, Holiday Classic, Intercity (Tournament), said Welch. I wish we could have got a win, but it was fun.
The son of Central Catholic coach Jason Welch, JT totaled 10 points and five rebounds.
Luke is a good friend of mine. Hes a great player and an even better person, Welch said. Im always going to be good friends with Luke. I dont like playing against him, and I didnt like practicing against him ever. But hes a great guy.
Heflen delivers
With starters Cory Noe and Pete Lambesis among the Titans sidelined, junior Lucas Heflen made his first career start and scored 15 points to match a career high.
I didnt really try to act different. I just played my role, Heflen said. I knew some guys would have to step up, but you dont want to do too much. You want to flow within the system. Some of the shots came to me, and I was able to knock some of them down.
Heflen scored 13 of his points in the second half, including eight straight to bolster the Wesleyan lead from four points to 48-36.
The first half I didnt come out timid, but I was not playing nearly as physical as I can or I should, said Heflen. That second half I started using my body more and taking some advantage I had over some of the other guards being a little smaller.
Sroka 3-pointer
Sophomore Ryan Sroka was the other starting lineup replacement and connected on 1 of 6 shots. But that make was critical.
After IWU roared out to a 25-10 lead, Millikin stormed back with 17 straight points to briefly forge ahead.
Srokas 3-pointer in transition 2:58 before halftime was the first Titan shot to find its mark in nearly seven minutes and gave Wesleyan a lead it would not relinquish.
A new Big Blue?
Millikin slipped to 8-7 and 3-3 in the CCIW. The Big Blue were a combined 5-33 the past two seasons.
I was displeased with the start, said first-year coach Kramer Soderberg. But in the face of adversity against a damn good ballclub, they didnt blink. They battled back and took the lead. That shows real character out of our guys which Im really proud of.
Welch hopes to part of a turnaround in the Big Blue program.
I came here and all my teammates came here with Coach Sodie trying to make a culture change, Welch said. Anyone at that game can tell its a different Millikin than in the past. Thats one thing were definitely proud of.

359,"Philadelphia on Thursday announced it would expand vaccine eligibility next week to include four more categories of essential workers.
The groups are: sanitation workers, maintenance and janitorial staff, utility workers, and postal and package delivery workers. They are part of the city’s classification known as 1C, which also lists other categories of people not included in Philadelphia’s expansion that starts Monday. The city, which oversees its own vaccinations separate from the rest of the state, will widen eligibility to the others in 1C later this month, officials said.
Groups in Philadelphia’s 1C not immediately eligible for vaccination include higher education, public-facing finance roles, transportation workers, construction workers, telecommunications and IT, media, the legal industry, and public health workers.
City Health Commissioner Thomas Farley said this week that Philadelphia would open eligibility to all adults no later than May 1, following federal guidance.
The news came the day after Pennsylvania officials said they would allow everyone 16 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine starting April 19, with many able to schedule appointments sooner. For people outside of Philadelphia, the entire 1B group, which includes first responders and education workers, will be eligible on Monday, and 1C will be eligible a week later, on April 12.
The city is still working to vaccinate all residents 65 and older, along with other groups of people already eligible. Farley said it is especially important to vaccinate people 65 and up as quickly as possible because coronavirus case rates are rising.
Pennsylvania reported 3,893 new COVID-19 cases Thursday, and the state is now averaging 4,073 new cases a day over the last seven days — a 54% jump over the last two weeks.
The rise is being driven in part by the B.1.1.7 variant of the virus, which was first detected in the United Kingdom and spreads more easily than the coronavirus that emerged in China 15 months ago. COVID-19 hospitalizations are also rising in Pennsylvania, with patients getting younger as more older people receive vaccinations. On Thursday, 2,075 residents were hospitalized with COVID-19, up from 1,450 hospitalizations two weeks ago. Pennsylvania also reported 27 new deaths, driving the death toll to at least 25,120 people across the commonwealth.
Philadelphia announced 482 new confirmed cases of the coronavirus Thursday. The city also announced 12 additional deaths. A total of 3,282 Philadelphia residents have died of COVID-19. The rate of new cases and hospitalizations has been increasing in the city in recent weeks. As of Thursday, there were 447 patients with the coronavirus in Philadelphia hospitals, with 56 of them on ventilators.
New Jersey also is experiencing a rise in COVID-19 cases, and the state on Thursday announced 30 new confirmed deaths. bmoran@inquirer.com

As coronavirus cases and deaths soared in India recently, doctors began to notice another disturbing trend. Some covid-19 patients who had been released from hospitals were coming back with different symptoms, including sinus pain, blurred vision, black and bloody nasal discharge and a dark discoloration around the nose.
The culprit was a deadly fungal infection called mucormycosis that physicians say is increasingly preying on people with immune systems weakened by covid-19 and the steroids used to treat it.
Though cases of what is known as ""black fungus"" remain rare, its lethality and increasing prevalence have prompted government warnings, put doctors on high alert and added to the country's health crisis.
""The death rate from mucormycosis is 50 percent,"" said Amarinder Singh Malhi from All India Institute of Medical Science, a public hospital in New Delhi. ""The death rate from covid is 2.5 percent. So we have to use these steroids very cautiously.""
Malhi said his hospital had not seen a spike in mucormycosis cases. But about a week ago, a journalist connected him on WhatsApp with a woman who had lost vision in one eye and was going blind in the other.
""I referred that case to the emergency room,"" he said, suspecting the woman had mucormycosis. ""She needed antifungal drugs immediately.""
Unless treated early, the aggressive fungal infection can often only be stopped with surgery.
One Mumbai-based eye surgeon said he saw 40 mucormycosis cases last month alone, and 11 had to have an eye removed.
""I will be removing her eye to save her life,"" the doctor, Akshay Nair, told the BBC shortly before operating on a 25-year-old woman who had recovered from covid three weeks ago only to contract mucormycosis. ""That's how this disease works.""
""I've seen 24 cases in 2 weeks!"" he tweeted recently. ""Scary.""
Nair told the BBC that between December and February, six colleagues in five cities reported 58 cases of the infection, most contracted 12 to 15 days after the patient recovered from covid.
P Suresh, head of ophthalmology at Fortis Hospital in Mulund, near Mumbai, told Reuters his hospital had treated at least 10 mucormycosis patients in the past two weeks - twice as many as in the year before the pandemic. All had been infected with covid-19, he said, and most were diabetic or had received immunosuppressants, such as steroids.
Mucormycosis infections are now four to five times what they were before the pandemic, infectious diseases specialist Atul Patel told AFP.
India has not released nationwide data on mucormycosis cases, but officials say the country is not suffering from a major outbreak.
""It's not something to panic about, but you have to be aware of when to seek consultation,"" Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at the state-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), told Reuters.
Mucor mold spores can be found in soil, manure or the air but normally don't affect healthy people, doctors say. For the immunocompromised, however, the fungus can be deadly.
""In the pre-covid era, this type of fungus would come in immunocompromised patients, patients with severe diabetes, leukemia, lymphoma and other immunodeficiencies,"" Malhi said.
He blamed the recent increase in mucormycosis on the overuse of steroids to stem the pandemic.
""We are seeing a 100 to 200 percent increase in cases in some states,"" he said. ""We did not see that previously in the first [covid] wave. Now, in the second wave, we are seeing it because we are using steroids more. These steroids are a double-edged sword.""
Prince Surana, a doctor and CEO of several private hospitals in Mumbai, said reports of mucormycosis at other local hospitals had led his group to tighten policies on steroid use that have, so far, prevented black fungus infections.
""We have not been giving steroids . . . to every covid patient,"" he said, ""especially if the patient is susceptible to that type of cross-infection or has a comorbidity, like diabetes.""
Surana said doctors needed to tell covid patients when they are discharged to monitor for symptoms of mucormycosis, such as sinus pain, swelling or numbness, or vision loss - a warning also issued over the weekend by the ICMR.
But the crush of covid cases has made checking on discharged patients more difficult, Surana said, and has also complicated sterilization.
""In normal times we'd fumigate the ICU every 14 days. Now, with covid, complete fumigation is not possible,"" he said, adding that his hospitals had compensated by putting extra effort into deep-cleaning surfaces.

363,"“And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day. And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” (The Book of Acts, chapter 2) 
The conditions under which we have been living over the last few years have been challenging, to say the least. We hear many voices speaking loudly about what constitutes a good society. These voices are not, however, like the ones to which Peter refers to in the Book of Acts in the New Testament. Might there be a Pentecost-like moment for us today — a pouring out of a new spirit?
We feel vulnerable and the COVID-19 pandemic acutely reminds us of our mortality. Amid this we see expressions of hatred based upon such things as ethnic, gender or sexual identity. We have also heard and felt the spirits of our mutual interdependence, advocacy for social justice and love as human compassion raise its voice. There are people who act to counter the various forms of violence and oppression that cause the suffering of many. The spirit and voice of hate and the spirit and voice of love mutually exist.
It feels as though, as a society,  we are standing at a decisive dividing line. On one side is death and on the other side is life. Although many sacred texts tell us to “choose life,” we live with an awareness of so much destruction of human life. We are increasingly challenged to become awakened to how hatred and injustice functions on individual, institutional, structural and systemic levels. This awareness can make us feel overwhelmed by the enormity of injustice and hatred. We rationalize our annihilation of one another by defining our differences as reasons to hate one another. All of this can cause  us to live in fear and without hope.
For some religious people these negative conditions are seen as signs that we are living in the “last days.” Some Christians believe that the last days are a period that foretells the second coming of Christ. As human beings we cannot assign a particular date when this will happen. It can occur right now or a thousand years from now, as we understand time. It is God who oversees us and our world and not any human entity.
Those who believe in the end time or “last days” live their lives preparing for such a time. They hope that they are living in a way that God will judge them as worthy of the blessing of eternal life with God. In a sense, this is the hope of most of those who believe in God and eternal life after death.
One can live with the perspective that we are living in the last days. They can pray and hope that Christ will eminently return, judge and redeem the world. How believing this would impact the way they live every day is for them to decide. It is understandable why some who believe in God and are gripped by the amount of pain and suffering they see and maybe are experiencing would want Jesus to return, and to do so quickly.
Perhaps, like some of you, the extent of strife, pain, suffering and death I have witnessed recently has caused me to pause and wonder: has humankind aligned itself so much with evil that we are heading for our destruction? Am I helpless to do anything about it except to seek my own cover and protection of those I love? I live with an end in view, not the end of God’s created order, but my own end. How God chooses to intervene in human history is God’s prerogative. I try to live in hope, to imagine the future, and try not to live in the present by infusing it with the past. Challenging evil and not trivializing loving our fellow human beings helps us to remain in touch with our humanity as well as our divinity.
I believe that there are more good people doing good things in the world than there are evil people doing evil and harmful things in the world. However, I hope that good people do not become weary and less vigilant in doing good.
I hope that people will continue to rise up and not allow extremist people with a racial superiority complex diminish our capacity to further become a democratic nation. It is time for the old dream that all people are created equal to be given a new opportunity to be realized.
I hope that our greater awareness of our mutual interdependence will increase our compassion toward one another, and that we strive to become a more humane society and world.

Wisdom suggests to me that whatever is God’s will, it will be done. We live, not out of fear of these being the last days but by knowing assuredly that there will be a last day for each of us. Faith, in God through Jesus Christ, encourages me to live each day with gratitude, humility and making the effort to serve the needs of others; to live lovingly and not out of fear.
Living faithfully in an uncertain time is to be possessed — gripped by this faith and hope. Faith in God is the substance of the dreams and visions hoped for and the evidence of such dreams and visions not yet seen in their full reality. Until they are and during uncertain times, we hold on and trust in the goodness of God.

When Covid-19 vaccines first arrived at health departments around the country, officials took to calling the shots liquid gold in a plea to prevent doses from going unused or being wasted.
Now that supplies are ample and the eager are dwindling, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued new guidance. Sites should not miss an opportunity to vaccinate an individual, even if it means remaining doses in a vial will go to waste, the CDC said late Thursday.
""As access to Covid-19 vaccine increases, it is important for providers to not miss any opportunity to vaccinate every eligible person who presents at vaccine clinics,"" the new CDC guidance said.
Many health workers and state officials had already been saying that vaccinating people should be the priority over ensuring every dose in an open vial is used.
""If you have someone in front of you who needs a vaccine, go ahead and use what you've got and try to use it as best you can and as efficiently as you can. But we know that we're at a point where there will be some wastage that is unavoidable. We've got to get people vaccinated now,"" said Thomas Dobbs, state health officer for Mississippi.
As part of the effort to reach the unvaccinated, authorities are aiming to send vaccines to smaller settings, such as doctor's offices and pop-up clinics. Rather than vaccinating hundreds or thousands of people a day, a site might vaccinate tens of people, or fewer. However, bulk packaging, ideal for mass-vaccination sites, might lead to more wasted doses at smaller clinics.
The Covid-19 vaccines made by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, Moderna Inc., and Johnson & Johnson have different handling requirements, storage protocols and guidelines for thawing and timing doses.
Generally, the more doses in the vials, the more potential for waste. J&J vials contain five doses, and Pfizer vials contain six doses. Moderna vials contain about 10 doses, but the company was allowed last month to begin filling vials with as many as 15 doses.
Once punctured, multidose vials must be used within 12 hours for the Moderna vaccine, six hours for the Pfizer-BioNTech one, and two to six hours for J&J's shot depending on how it is stored.
Moderna didn't respond to a request for comment. Johnson & Johnson said its vaccines provide protection with just one shot and are easily transportable. Pfizer will start shipping its six-dose vials in smaller bundles at the end of the month, a company spokesman said.
At Clinica Medicos in Chattanooga, Tenn., where Kelly Rodney Arnold and other family physicians cater to a difficult-to-reach Latino population, the wait list on hand for extra shots has dried up. They are grabbing people for shots when they come in for other reasons, such as medication refills, prenatal visits or immigration physicals.
""Before, the demand was so high and the scarcity seemed so real that the focus was: not a wasted dose. Now the mentality has shifted to: not a missed opportunity,"" she said.
The CDC has said it hopes to maintain wastage below 2% of total doses delivered. Most states are reporting wasted doses far below that number, with a national wastage rate of 0.4%, as of Thursday. That is concerning some health officials who think that at this stage of the rollout, some waste should be acceptable.
In North Carolina, where just 0.3% of doses have been wasted so far, the state says that vaccinating people should take precedence over using every dose in a vial.
To discourage vaccine hoarding, Texas stopped posting weekly vaccine waste information this month out of concern it might publicly shame people who needed to waste doses in order to get shots in arms. ""We have prioritized vaccinating a person over saving doses. We would not want providers to be looked at negatively for following our guidance,"" a spokeswoman said.
Health authorities are grappling with what level of wastage might be acceptable, given that vaccines remain a scarce global resource.
""There's going to be more thrown-away doses. And that's a real tragedy,"" said Sean Valles, director of the Center for Bioethics and Social Justice at Michigan State University. ""But it's not like that dose sitting inside a CVS was going to go to India. That's not how it works.""
The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, or Astho, is working with federal officials to see whether vaccine manufacturers might pack the shots in smaller allotments to limit potential waste, said Marcus Plescia, the organization's chief medical officer. Single-dose syringes would be ideal, but vials with fewer doses would also be a solution, he said.

(Nasdaq:HMST) (including its consolidated subsidiaries, the ""Company"" or ""HomeStreet""), the parent company of HomeStreet Bank, today announced the financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2021. As we present non-GAAP measures in this release, the reader should refer to the non-GAAP reconciliations set forth below under the section “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”  “In 2021, which was our 100th anniversary, HomeStreet reported earnings in excess of $100 million for the first time ever. Our record earnings of $115 million were driven by record loan originations, strong core deposit growth and the benefits of our past efficiency and profitability improvement initiatives,” said Mark K. Mason, HomeStreet’s Chairman of the Board, President, and Chief Executive Officer. “Portfolio loan originations totaled $3.3 billion in 2021 and noninterest-bearing deposits increased 21%. As reflected in our stable efficiency ratio year over year, we believe the strategic changes we implemented in prior years, including the restructuring of our single family mortgage business, have provided meaningful operating leverage and more consistent and less volatile earnings. We anticipate continuing improvements as our operating leverage should provide us the opportunity to grow revenues without commensurate additions to personnel or other operating expenses. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their great work this year which has allowed HomeStreet to be so successful in spite of the ongoing challenges of the pandemic.”    Fourth Quarter  Operating Results       Fourth quarter 2021 compared to third quarter 2021    Net income: $29.4 million compared to $27.2 million   Earnings per fully diluted share: $1.43 compared to $1.31   Net interest margin: 3.34% compared to 3.42%   Return on Average Equity ('ROAE""): 16.1% compared to 14.8%   Return on Average Tangible Equity (""ROATE""): 17.0% compared to 15.6%   Return on average assets (""ROAA""): 1.59% compared to 1.48%   Efficiency ratio: 62.2% compared to 62.8%        Full Year  Operating Results       2021 compared to 2020    Net income: $115.4 million compared to $80.0 million   Core net income: $115.4 million compared to $88.8 million   Earnings per fully diluted share: $5.46 compared to $3.47   Core earnings per fully diluted share: $5.46 compared to $3.85   Net interest margin: 3.38% compared to 3.13%   ROAE: 15.9% compared to 11.3%   ROATE: 16.8% compared to 12.1%   Core ROATE: 16.8% compared to 13.4%   ROAA: 1.58% compared to 1.10%   Core ROAA: 1.58% compared to 1.23%   Efficiency Ratio: 61.9% compared to 61.4%        Financial Position       Fourth quarter 2021 compared to third quarter 2021    Loan portfolio originations: $795 million in the fourth quarter   Single family loans held for sale originations: $361 million, a 13% decrease   Commercial and consumer noninterest-bearing deposits decreased 5%   Period ending cost of deposits: 0.15%, unchanged   Tangible book value per share: $34.04 compared to $33.18          2021 Activity    Loan portfolio originations: $3.3 billion   Single family loans held for sale originations: $2.0 billion   Commercial and consumer noninterest-bearing deposits increased 21%   Tangible book value per share increased from $31.42 to $34.04      “Loan origination levels remained strong with $795 million of loan originations in the current quarter and $3.3 billion in 2021,” added Mr. Mason. “Excluding the impact of the Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loans, and despite continuing high levels of prepayments, our loans held for investment grew 11% during 2021. During the fourth quarter, we completed a $244 million sale of permanent multifamily loans, realizing a net gain of 2.73%. Total deposits increased by 6% during 2021 and noninterest bearing deposits increased to 26% of total deposits. We recognized $6 million and $15 million of recoveries of pandemic related allowance for credit losses in the fourth quarter and in 2021, respectively. As we continue to have more clarity of the minimal impact COVID is having on our loan portfolio, and with projected improvements in our economies and anticipated changes in the composition of our loan portfolio, we expect to recover additional amounts of our allowance for credit losses in future periods.”    Other        Completed $100 million subordinated notes offering in January 2022   Repurchased a total of 374,320 shares of our common stock at an average price of $51.17 per share during the fourth quarter   Repurchased 1,873,294 shares at an average price of $44.92 per share during 2021, representing 8.6% of the outstanding shares at December 31, 2020   Declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share in the fourth quarter      Mr. Mason concluded, “With the completion of our $100 million subordinated notes offering in January 2022, we accessed lower cost capital to expand our share repurchase program and support our future growth. Relative to the outstanding stock at the beginning of each period, we have repurchased 12%, 9% and 9% of our outstanding common stock in 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.

HomeStreet, Inc. and Subsidiaries  Non-GAAP Financial Measures  To supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with GAAP, we use certain non-GAAP measures of financial performance.  In this press release, we use the following non-GAAP measures: (i) tangible common equity and tangible assets as we believe this information is consistent with the treatment by bank regulatory agencies, which excluded intangible assets from the calculation of capital ratios; (ii) core earnings which exclude certain charges primarily related to our discontinued operations and restructuring activities as we believe this measure is a better comparison to be used for projecting future results; and (iii) an efficiency ratio which is the ratio of noninterest expenses to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income, excluding certain items of income or expense and excluding taxes incurred and payable to the state of Washington as such taxes are not classified as income taxes and we believe including them in noninterest expenses impacts the comparability of our results to those companies whose operations are in states where assessed taxes on business are classified as income taxes.  These supplemental performance measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures provided by other companies in our industry. Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company’s performance that either excludes or includes amounts that are not normally excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. A non-GAAP financial measure may also be a financial metric that is not required by GAAP or other applicable requirements.  We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures, when taken together with the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide meaningful supplemental information regarding our performance by providing additional information used by management that is not otherwise required by GAAP or other applicable requirements. Our management uses, and believes that investors benefit from referring to, these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our operating results and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate a comparison of our performance to prior periods. We believe these measures are frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry. Rather, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. In the information below, we have provided reconciliations of, where applicable, the most comparable GAAP financial measures to the non-GAAP measures used in this press release, or a reconciliation of the non-GAAP calculation of the financial measure.

372,"It may still be the tail end of summer, but inside the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's Wisconsin hospital in Milwaukee, it feels like winter already. There, many infants and young children are hospitalized with illnesses that have them struggling to breathe. Most of them don't have COVID-19, but things like respiratory syncytial virus or parainfluenza, which are more prevalent than usual for this time of year. In most adults, viruses like RSV aren't a big deal, said Dr. Michael Meyer, who's the medical director of the pediatric intensive care unit at Children's Wisconsin and professor of pediatrics at the Medical College of Wisconsin.
For them, it causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But for young children, who have smaller airways that are more easily blocked by mucus, it can be serious.
Summer patients in pediatric intensive care are usually there for surgical procedures while they're out of school, chronic medical conditions or trauma-related injuries, like those suffered in a car crash .
Right now, Meyer said, his hospital is admitting six to 12 infants per day with severe respiratory disease, at least three times what normal patient volumes would be. Many of these patients are staying longer, too.
Southern states are meanwhile seeing their pediatric ICUs fill with children infected by the more contagious delta variant of COVID-19. Children now account for more than a quarter of new cases nationwide, according to a Sept. 9 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics, and as more children get the virus, more will be hospitalized with it.
Could a similar surge in child cases be in store for Wisconsin? Meyer says our higher overall vaccination rate may save us from the worst of what the south is experiencing — but his hospital staff, already fatigued by the pandemic, is likely to stay busy for a while.
""I'm really worried that as we see more and more children infected with COVID — and that's what we're seeing — we're going to continue to see high volumes of children moving through,"" he said.
RSV, other viruses likely high
because of an immunity backlog
Just before the rise of COVID-19, the 2019-20 flu and respiratory virus season hit Wisconsin hard. At Children's, Meyer said, it was the busiest the hospital had been with RSV cases.
Since Children's Wisconsin in Milwaukee is the biggest of the handful of pediatric intensive care units in the state — at 72 beds, it's one of the largest in the nation — most Wisconsin kids with infections severe enough that they need to be hospitalized are coming there.
""We opened up more ICU beds for the first time than I'd ever seen,"" he said of the 2019-20 flu season.
Data from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services show more than 36,000 flu cases reported that season, leading to more than 4,400 hospitalizations and 183 deaths — including three children. The state also reported its highest-ever number of pregnant and postpartum people hospitalized with the flu.
In the thick of it — the week ending Feb. 15, 2020 — the state health department also reported 363 RSV cases, although its weekly respiratory viruses report doesn't specify how many were in adults and in children.
Flip the calendar a year forward and the data looks very different. As the pandemic drove us inside, the health department reported just two cases of RSV in the week ending Feb. 13, 2021.
By May, when the flu season typically ends, there had been zero flu deaths — of any age — in Wisconsin. There were five RSV cases that week.
But in the most recent respiratory report, from Sept. 4, 512 Wisconsinites that week had tested positive for RSV.
The 2020-21 lull is likely the reason that a rush of cases is happening now, Meyer said. As families stayed inside and avoided gathering with others to ward off COVID-19, many schools went virtual, and large events were canceled. Viruses lost all their regular avenues to infect young children.
Thus, babies born over a year ago and babies born in the past year all began to get exposed at the same time when the world opened back up earlier this spring and summer.
Meyer said it's likely not so much an early start to the 2021-22 respiratory virus season as a late burst of the previous year's season.
Now, ""the real risk is this just continues through the winter,"" Meyer said.
That would be made worse if COVID-19 infections in children keep increasing.
Dr. Ryan Westergaard, chief medical officer and state epidemiologist for communicable diseases in Wisconsin, shared that concern in a news briefing with reporters in mid-August.
Westergaard called it an ""unusual environment"" for childhood infections with RSV cases on the rise, pointing to fuller pediatric intensive care units, and said a rise in COVID-19 hospitalizations could make things worse.
""That adds some urgency to the precautions we must take to prevent transmission from reaching our schools and other settings,"" Westergaard said then.
Pediatric hospitals are doing OK,
but COVID could strain them
Evidence is mixed on whether the delta variant of COVID-19 is more severe for children, but one thing is certain: It's infecting many more of them.
The original strain of the virus appeared to affect children less severely than adults, bringing relief to parents and families. In Wisconsin, state health department data show that only 2% of COVID-19 cases among residents 0-19 required hospitalization, versus an overall rate of 5% for all age groups. Just three residents 19 or younger have died of the virus — none under 10.
But with delta, the number of children in the U.S. testing positive for the virus per week has grown nearly 30 times, from about 8,400 per week in June to more than 243,000 the week of Sept. 9, according to American Academy of Pediatrics data, the most ever.
When more children are infected, the number of them who need to be hospitalized for severe disease grows, and it has had hospitals in southern states sounding the alarm.
Children's hospitals in Florida, Tennessee, Mississippi and Arkansas, among others, have said their facilities were overwhelmed with the influx of COVID-19 patients. On Aug. 26, a group of more than 220 children's hospitals wrote to President Joe Biden asking him to take steps to support pediatric hospital capacity or risk insufficient space and staff to care for their young patients.
Like elsewhere, Wisconsin's child COVID-19 cases are increasing. From June through the end of August, cases in residents under 18 were growing the fastest compared to other age groups, state health department data show. But it hasn't yet resulted in a sharp uptick of hospitalizations because of the virus.
A spokesperson for Children's Wisconsin reported that the number of kids in the hospital who'd tested positive for COVID-19 doubled from eight to 16 from May to July, but noted some had been hospitalized for other reasons and just happened to test positive.
Although children under 12 aren't yet eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine, Meyer said Wisconsin kids might see broader protection from a state with a higher vaccination rate than some in the south.
A New York Times analysis found that the 10 most vaccinated states had relatively flat COVID-19 hospital admissions for youth, while childhood admissions in the 10 least vaccinated states had climbed. Wisconsin ranks 22nd in the nation for its percentage of fully vaccinated residents, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Meyer said his hospital hasn't seen many severe COVID-19 cases where kids have had to be placed on a ventilator, but he worries that could change, particularly if safety protocols such as masking continue to loosen as kids head back to school and extracurricular activities.
Because Children's was fresh off the flu season he called the busiest in history when the pandemic began, he's not so much worried about having enough space if respiratory hospitalizations continue to rise. They've had practice with that.
Rather, it's about the hospital's workforce being depleted — a story shared at nearly every medical facility across the country right now.
""The risk is, we've had a lot of people that have been impacted by COVID. Either they've had it, they know someone who has had it, their kids have been out of school ... that's caused a whole deal of stress in the health care field,"" Meyer said.
""We're confronting many sick children with health care providers who have worked really hard.""
While kids under 12 await a COVID-19 vaccine, Meyer said it will be especially important to get them their flu vaccine this year to ward off at least one type of respiratory virus.

United Airlines Holdings Inc.
America's vacation from travel restrictions might get cancelled. The European Union recommended halting nonessential travel from the U.S. because of the rise of Covid-19 cases , diplomats said Monday. The bloc's earlier decision, in June, to place the U.S. on its safe list was a welcome relief for Europe's tourist-heavy southern economies after pandemic-fueled recessions. The trade group Airlines for America called the recommendations a disappointment to the U.S. airline industry. United Airlines shares lost 3.8% Monday.
Zoom Video Communications Inc.
Will Zoom meetings survive the end of the pandemic? The company on Monday surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time in its history, but demand for its videoconferencing services is showing signs of slowing. Zoom said that small businesses and consumers were starting to spend less as opportunities for in-person meetings and gatherings expand, and some metrics supercharged by the pandemic had begun to normalize. As offices start to reopen, analysts are raising questions about Zoom's ability to retain paying customers and sustain the growth rate it enjoyed during the pandemic's work-from-home boom. Zoom shares fell 17% Tuesday.
Procter & Gamble Co.
Americans are buying up toilet paper again . Procter & Gamble, the biggest U.S. manufacturer of toilet paper and paper towels, said it is increasing production as demand rises. The maker of Charmin toilet paper and Bounty paper towels is speeding up production lines, running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week and investing to boost shipping volumes. While the situation isn't as dire as it was in early 2020 when panicked shoppers cleared shelves of paper towels and toilet paper, for many months sales had returned to pre-pandemic levels as Americans worked through their stockpiles. P&G shares fell 0.4% Tuesday.
Alphabet Inc.
Google is hitting refresh on its return-to-work schedule. The Alphabet unit said on Tuesday that it is pushing back its voluntary return plans for corporate staff, extending work-from-home policies until Jan. 10 amid rising Covid-19 infections and hospitalizations. Google will also give staff holidays on Oct. 22 and Dec. 17 this year to ""reset and recharge."" The delay comes a month after Google pushed its return to offices to October from September because of the highly infectious Delta variant. Earlier this month, its Silicon Valley peer, Apple Inc., delayed its back-to-work plans for staff until at least January. Alphabet shares ended 0.1% lower Tuesday.
Mondelez International Inc.
Grocers are having a snack attack. Stores worried about a run on Ritz crackers and Oreos are boosting their orders in case the maker of these snacks, Mondelez, curbs production due to a labor strike that is now in its fourth week . Mondelez workers are opposing changes to work schedules, overtime and healthcare that the company has sought in contract negotiations. Unionized workers kicked off the strike on Aug. 10 at a Mondelez bakery in Portland, Ore., and the action has since spread to two other bakeries and three distribution facilities in Colorado, Illinois, Georgia and Virginia. Mondelez shares declined 0.7% Thursday.
Moderna Inc.
How low should a dose of Covid-19 booster shot go? That is the question before the Food and Drug Administration as it weighs a Moderna request to authorize a booster at 50 micrograms, half the dosage given in the first two shots. But The Wall Street Journal reported that some in the government favor a higher booster dose on hopes that it would assure stronger protection against Covid-19 variants. People who have seen the data told the Journal both doses produce strong immune responses. One possible benefit of a lower dose is fewer side effects. Moderna shares rose 2% Thursday.
Ford Motor Co.
The auto industry is hitting the brakes on Labor Day weekend car sales due to a computer-chip shortage. Dealership lots were stripped of inventory ahead of one of the biggest selling weekends of the year. The availability of new and used vehicles is down following a semiconductor shortfall that hampered auto production in the spring and summer. Both Ford and General Motors Co. said recently that they are extending production cuts at several North American factories into September because of a lack of chips, used in everything from air bags and engines to media displays. Ford shares closed down 0.9% Friday.

380,"""The Phantom of the Opera"" will haunt. ""The Lion King"" will roar. And ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" will dazzle.
Yes, Broadway shows are finally coming back  after shutting down March 12, 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic – with plenty of requirements for  stars and theatergoers, including vaccinations.
Casts and crews are excited to see colleagues and audiences and to once again experience the joy of live theater. But nerves permeate the air in Times Square, too, as the community remembers the terrifying surge New York City faced last spring and as the threat of the delta variant looms large. The death of Broadway star Nick Cordero in July 2020, after a months-long battle with COVID-19, still lingers, too.
""Everyone's definitely excited,"" says Maree Johnson, who plays Madame Giry in ""Phantom."" ""But there's also that little air of hesitancy, because it's a new normal that we're all entering.""
Johnson developed a fever and  headaches shortly after the Broadway shutdown – ultimately discovering she caught COVID-19, along with her husband and daughter. Back then, it was unclear how the virus spread, so she went into a cleaning frenzy, only to realize she lost her sense of smell when she didn't recognize the strong scent of Pine-Sol cleaner or her favorite perfume.
""I knew then something odd was going on,"" she says, noting she only regained her olfactory sense six to 10 months later.
Johnson, who has been a part of the ""Phantom"" cast since May 2017, was due for a wardrobe fitting in mid-August. But one of the show's ""much-loved dressers,"" Jennifer Arnold, wouldn't be in attendance – she was sick at the same time as Johnson and later died.
""Halfway through my recovery, I discovered that she was in hospital,"" Johnson says. ""And then we lost her.""
Rehearsals begin Sept. 27 ahead of an Oct. 22 reopening  for ""Phantom,"" Brodway's longest-running musical, at the Majestic Theatre.
While some shows won't start rehearsing until September or later for staggered reopenings, others already have found ways for Broadway fans to see their performances.
""Come From Away"" – the musical about stranded passengers whose flights were diverted on 9/11 – filmed a special performance in May, to be broadcast on Apple TV+ Sept. 10 before the 20th anniversary of 9/11.
""To walk into the theater and see all your stuff still sitting there, just with a light coat of dust the way you left it 18 months ago, was so surreal,"" says De'Lon Grant, a cast member. They had only about 10 days to rehearse for the filmed performance.
""The hardest hurdle was just convincing yourself that it would come back,"" he says. Rehearsals begin Sept. 1 before a Sept. 21 reopening.
Emily McGill, a communications consultant, was in the small audience for the filming. Expect goosebumps galore: ""I didn't realize how emotional of an experience it would be to be sitting in a theater again,"" she says.
Audiences could certainly use prayer right now, particularly as the country reels from crises. ""Pass Over,"" a modern, timely retelling of ""Waiting for Godot,"" follows two Black friends in search of a better life.  The show returned Sunday,  the first  Broadway play to reopen in 18 months.
""We're making history,"" says Cody Renard Richard, production stage manager. He contracted COVID-19 in March in New York, like Johnson did.
Johnny Milani is eager to return as a stage manager for ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.""
""The idea of getting back into a theater is daunting but incredibly exciting, because we get to create all of that magic all over again,"" he says. Rehearsals are set to begin in October for an updated version of the production – it had been split into two parts – to premiere Nov. 12.
James Snyder, who plays Potter, says the heart and soul of the story is still there, but it is much more streamlined. His wife, Jacqueline, co-founder of The Product Boss small-business coaching platform and podcast, became the primary breadwinner during the pandemic, giving him newfound perspective.
""I'm a different human being day to day, not to mention 18 months later, having ended an amazing run and then dove immediately into being a stay-at-home dad who was homeschooling his kids and just trying to find work when I could and really support my wife as much as I possibly could,"" he says.
He's curious how rehearsals will go – will they need to wear masks be required?  – but trusts his producers, who  covered his health insurance throughout the pandemic.
While she feels safe, Johnson wants to protect others. ""The thought of me accidentally transmitting it  and causing a health issue for someone else, that's probably where the anxiety is living in me,"" Johnson says.
Snyder learned his role as a father and husband is just as valuable as his job. ""What's amazing is that really, at the end of the day, it was as rewarding, if not more rewarding, than stepping out onto a stage in front of 1,600 people, eight times a week.""

Madeline LeBlanc, 24, a Louisiana State University employee, after receiving a dose of COVID-19 vaccine at the Baton Rouge campus on Tuesday, Aug. 3, 2021. Louisiana is leading the nation in an explosion of new cases.  (Emily Kask/The New York Times)


HAMMOND, La. — Officials in Louisiana have been willing to try just about anything to jolt the state’s lagging COVID-19 vaccination rates, from a $1 million cash giveaway to a public service announcement featuring the recent 14-year-old national spelling bee champion.
But when Madeline LeBlanc relented and got her first vaccine dose this week, she was motivated by something entirely different: fear.
After seeing news reports about the delta variant raging across the state, LeBlanc, 24, had come to see that without a vaccine, she risked not just her own life but those of others around her. “I don’t want to be the one inhibiting someone else’s health,” said LeBlanc, who lives in Baton Rouge.
Demand for the shots has nearly quadrupled in recent weeks in Louisiana, a promising glimmer that the deadly reality of the virus might be breaking through a logjam of misunderstanding and misinformation.
The new push for vaccinations has been driven by an explosion in coronavirus cases. But it takes time for vaccines to bolster immune systems, and the state — which now leads the country in new cases — could still be weeks away from relief.
Hospitals are overflowing with more COVID-19 patients than ever before. Even children’s hospitals have packed intensive care units. And the delta variant has alarmed doctors, who described seeing patients in their 20s and 30s rapidly declining and dying.
“These are the darkest days of our pandemic,” said Catherine O’Neal, the chief medical officer at Our Lady of the Lake Regional Medical Center in Baton Rouge.
The delta variant has unleashed a rush of diagnoses across the United States, but Louisiana has emerged as a troublesome hot spot, with the highest per capita rate of cases in the country and a beleaguered health care system straining to keep up.
“That’s a miserable place to be, I know it,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said, describing the swirl of frustration and shame expressed by government officials, epidemiologists and front-line medical workers as their state suffers the catastrophic consequences of a failure to vaccinate more people.
The state is averaging more than 4,300 new cases per day, according to New York Times data. Resources have been taxed — especially in the state’s southeastern corner — as cases have surged from the Gulf Coast into the northern reaches of the state.
In Baton Rouge, one hospital called in the kind of federal emergency support staff usually reserved for the aftermath of a hurricane. In Hammond, a city of some 21,000 people in the toe of Louisiana’s boot, nurses were ordered to pick up extra shifts.
Vaccination rates are increasing in many states, as employers and universities have started requiring the shots to return to work and class. In the Southeast, where vaccinations have lagged behind the national rate, those upticks have come in states like Mississippi and Florida just as reported cases began spiking.
In an effort to help temper the spread of the virus in Louisiana while pushing for more vaccinations, Edwards reinstated a statewide mask mandate that went into effect Wednesday, requiring anyone 5 or older to cover their face indoors.

But the governor’s orders have produced fierce resistance from the outset of the pandemic. On Monday, exasperation bled into his voice as he urged residents to heed the mask order and listen to the parade of doctors and hospital officials he had summoned to describe the growing crisis.
“Do you give a damn?” Edwards asked. “I hope you do. I do. I’ve heard it said often: Louisiana is the most pro-life state in the nation. I want to believe that.”

Public health experts are frustrated to find Louisiana in such a crisis, especially given its recent history. The state had a horrifying introduction to the coronavirus, as Mardi Gras festivities in 2020 turned out to be an ideal incubator for COVID-19 to spread, plunging New Orleans into an early season of death and despair.
Now, largely because of the new wave of illness, lines have returned to vaccination sites across the state. Thirty-seven percent of the population is now fully vaccinated, climbing roughly 3 percentage points from June but still trailing the national rate, with just shy of half of the country fully vaccinated.
“The public is finally hearing how bad it has gotten,” said Dr. Robert C. Peltier, the chief medical officer for North Oaks Health System in Hammond, an hour east of Baton Rouge.

For many younger people, fear of the vaccines has been overtaken by fear of the virus itself, after hearing stories of people their age succumbing to COVID-19.
“It’s definitely scary that it could be you who ends up in the hospital,” a 22-year-old woman who gave only her first name, Brianna, said as she waited for her shot Tuesday at a vaccination site run by the Louisiana National Guard in Baton Rouge.
Ashlynn Robert had avoided getting vaccinated because of a fear of needles, but her mother started pressing her as hospitalizations rose. “It wasn’t that bad,” Robert, 24, said after her shot. “I was being dramatic.”

Among the hardest-hit spots in the state is Tangipahoa Parish, a collection of small, mostly working-class towns where life had defiantly marched forward, even as the virus spread.
In Hammond, the largest city in Tangipahoa Parish, North Oaks Medical Center has been slammed with COVID-19 patients: 93 on a recent day, ranging in age from 20 to 85. Before this wave, the highest number of patients had been 65 in December.
Patti Hilbun, 65, had been there nearly two weeks. “I will be blatantly honest,” she said. “This is as real as smallpox and polio when I was a kid.”
Hilbun was reluctant to get vaccinated. She had once had a poor reaction to a flu shot, she said, and she has Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder. Her husband kept pushing her to get the shot. “I just talked myself into it,” she said. But before she actually had a chance to get vaccinated, she went to a wedding and did not wear a mask.
Soon, she felt tired. Her breathing became more labored. It worsened until July 21, when she came to North Oaks, the main hospital in the parish. “I had to will myself to live,” she said.
On Tuesday afternoon, Hilbun finally got some good news: She could leave the hospital.
“She’s definitely one of the lucky ones,” said Stacy Newman, her doctor. The same day, she said, a 31-year-old man had died of the illness. He had two children, and his wife was also a patient with COVID-19.

For Newman and her colleagues, the North Oaks hospital and the community it serves have sometimes seemed to exist on different planets.
Inside, the gravity of the pandemic is inescapable, leading them to take as many precautions as possible. Outside, people largely stopped wearing masks. The virus was regarded by some as a hoax.
Some of the thinking doctors and nurses found baffling: The vaccines were seen as dangerous, yet one feed store had to post a sign telling people that ivermectin, a heartworm medication for pets and livestock, could not be used to treat COVID-19.
Friendships have been tested. One nurse told her husband to get vaccinated or move out.
“I feel less safe in the community than I do in the hospital,” said Dr. Justin Fowlkes, a pulmonary and critical care physician.
The hospital has space for more patients, but not adequate staffing. More than 60 employees were out with COVID-19 this week. Roughly 40 others were out for other illnesses. There were also 400 vacant positions.
Brooke Moran, a North Oaks nurse, has been working long hours before returning home at night to her husband and daughter. She said she was relieved that many in her extended family had gotten vaccinated. They listened to her. They trusted her. She just wished others had gotten the message before the virus escalated to this point.
For 15 months, she has been surrounded by suffering. This time was different, she said. It was worse and unnecessary.
“I am still dedicated,” Moran said, her voice breaking, tears welling behind her glasses. “I still have compassion. I care for these people. But it’s just frustrating. It’s preventable and I don’t want these people to die. But they still do. It’s really out of our hands.”

",Vaccinations Rise in Louisiana as Pandemic Reaches Its ‘Darkest Days.’ It’s Still Not Enough.
383,"Jun. 23 - In the wake of a glitch last year that prevented the Butler County commissioners from switching to a lower-risk health insurance plan, they have hired a new broker to help them navigate the unpredictable benefit market.
The commissioners approved a three-year $292,500 contract with the McGohan Brabender Agency on Monday, effectively ending a long-standing relationship with HORAN. The contract can be extended for another year at a cost of $103,800 and $51,900 for six months after that. The county was paying HORAN $82,776 annually compared to $97,500 for the new company.
Human Resources Director Laurie Murphy said they received 10 proposals for the consulting job and HORAN was not one of them. The new company will perform a host services for the county involving insurance that costs around $20 million annually, something that has gotten tricky with the coronavirus pandemic.
""COVID has changed the course of healthcare claims that we're still trying to evaluate the implications of people not being able to seek care and what impact that may have on our claims going forward next year,"" Murphy said. ""That's some of the strategies we rely on our broker to evaluate, trends, market, best practices, benchmarking, things like that.""
The consultant change was prompted by an issue last year when the commissioners tried to make a switch from self-insurance to a lower risk, traditional policy, they had to rescind the contract because a lawsuit was threatened.
The commissioners approved a fully insured plan through the County Employee Benefits Consortium of Ohio (CEBCO) with Anthem in October and then two weeks later rescinded that contract and approved staying with United Healthcare for another year at a cost of $21.2 million. United Healthcare threatened to sue because HORAN didn't put out a request for proposals so the process was deemed flawed.
County Administrator Judi Boyko said the request for proposals for the new broker wasn't necessarily premised on finding the best price, it was about service. She said the group of stakeholders representing the sheriff, county auditor and others that evaluated the proposals unanimously recommended hiring McGohan Brabender.
""You don't go by lowest bid, it's not a qualifying thing,"" Boyko said. ""It's based on the proposal and their proposal based on the stakeholder group that we convened, was the most responsive, comprehensive on how they intend to address some of the county's needs.""
McGohan Brabender will be helping the commissioners develop a multi-year strategy for handling health care and managing costs.
The county went to a self-insurance model in 2017 after several years of double-digit percentage increases for insurance coverage. Some large, unusual claims over several years drove those increases, including a single $5 million claim in 2013 and a $3 million claims month in November 2014.
The commissioners at the time said they wanted more control over their costs but Commissioner Don Dixon said when they wanted to switch back to traditional last year the cost difference between self-insurance and traditional coverage was negligible when figuring in reduced risk. Under self insurance the county paid an administrative fee and claims out of county coffers.
He said it will depend what the new consultant recommends but he is leaning toward the more secure coverage.
""My preference long-term is to get back to traditional,"" Dixon said. ""But we haven't had the right time or the right circumstances to be able to do it, or the right number.""
In her 2022 tax budget guidance Finance Director Angel Burton asked the various office holders. department heads and independent boards to budget a 12% increase for health and 5% hike for dental insurance. She told the Journal-News they hope the hike is a ""worst-case scenario.""
""We chose the higher increases due to the uncertainty related to the health insurance industry and a projected influx of medical procedures that were delayed due to COVID-19,"" Burton said. ""Our dental rates have been locked in the past two years and will be up for renewal in 2022.""

388,"NEW YORK, April 4, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The Nuveen CLO Issuance Fund, LP (the ""Fund"") has closed with over $375 million in committed capital from global public and private pension plans, family offices and insurance companies. The Fund provides the opportunity to invest alongside Nuveen's parent company, TIAA, the #1 not-for-profit retirement market provideri with nearly $1.4 trillion in assets under management ii. The Fund provides exposure primarily to the controlling or majority equity interests of multiple Nuveen new issue CLOs and CLO warehouses, as well as opportunistic holdings in legacy Nuveen CLO debt and equity tranches, via a private placement, commingled fund structure.
""The closing of our inaugural CLO equity fund is core to our mission of delivering compelling risk adjusted returns for our clients through a nimble and opportunistic approach. Over the coming months, the market will be seeing a lot more from the Nuveen leveraged finance team,"" said Scott Grace, Head of Nuveen's leveraged finance platform. ""Since holding its initial close in August 2020, the Fund has quickly scaled, investing capital into the equity stakes of multiple new-issue Nuveen CLOs, CLO warehouses as well as debt and equity tranches of legacy Nuveen CLOs through the secondary market. The Fund capitalized on favorable conditions in the new issue CLO market, while taking advantage of market volatility by engaging in opportunistic trades in the secondary market on a selective basis.""
For over 15 years, including during the 2008-09 Global Financial Crisis and 2020 COVID-19 downturn, Nuveen's retired CLOs have delivered an average net internal rate of return of over 20% to investors and have never missed an equity distribution due to an overcollateralization test failureiii. We believe this performance can be attributed to actively managing credit risk and identifying the catalysts of both credit deterioration and, conversely, attractive total return.
""Our differentiated approach has been cycle tested and proven via our performance track record, active par building and consistent liability management, all while actively managing tail risk,"" said Himani Trivedi, Head of Structured Credit and Lead Portfolio Manager for Nuveen leveraged finance issued CLOs and its investments in third-party managed CLOs with almost two decades of experience investing in CLO markets. ""These qualities have enabled Nuveen to consistently achieve some of the best new issue cost of liabilities compared to our peers, including in the CLOs in which the Fund has deployed capital thus far.""
Nuveen's leveraged finance platform is one of the industry's largest and best resourced providers of high yield credit, broadly syndicated loans, CLOs and alternative credit strategies.

391,"Richard Fitts faced the same problem just about every college athlete did last spring. The COVID-19 pandemic paused his season and shut down campus. The junior Auburn baseball pitcher needed a place to throw, but all the baseball fields around his hometown of Helena were closed.
Fortunately, Fitts' father, Danny, loves projects. Two days after the right-hander got home, they came up with the idea to build their own facility. It took about a week of planning and another few days to put together, but the result was the perfect at-home training tool – a foldable, portable pitcher's mound.
Fitts used it to propel himself toward becoming the next breakout pitching star for Auburn when the season begins next Friday against Presbyterian – the former walk-on will be part of a weekend rotation headlined by Cody Greenhill and Jack Owen (if he's healthy; Owen is dealing with a dislocated finger that could sideline him a few weeks).
Maybe this is where Fitts would have ended up this season regardless. He struggled as a freshman going through SEC play for the first time, compiling a 7.88 ERA out of Auburn's bullpen in 2019. But he pitched well in two appearances in the College World Series in Omaha, allowing two runs on five hits over 5 1/3 innings against Mississippi State and Louisville.
That success continued into his sophomore campaign, where Fitts was 1-0 with a 2.77 ERA in six appearances before the season was shut down after  18 games.
But there were things the 6-foot-3, 215-pound right-hander felt like he needed to work on. Mainly, his velocity. He touched 95 mph on the radar gun a few times during the first two seasons of his career but couldn't maintain that speed over multiple innings. He wanted to get to a place where he could.
By the time the fall rolled around, Fitts was sitting 95-96 mph and reaching back for as much as 98.
""He's probably the only guy that didn't stop throwing over the break,"" Greenhill said. ""We mess with him every day about getting tweeted out all the time, but he's showing up and making guys look silly up there. That's just a testament of his hard work.""
Fitts had plenty of help, and not just from dad. He said he called Auburn strength and conditioning coach Chris Joyner once a week during quarantine to pick his brain about specific workouts he could do. He worked with pitching coach Tim Hudson to figure out different things he could do with his fastball to speed it up. He developed a changeup, too.
He also had his own personal coach at home in the form of his older brother, Trevor Fitts, who played for Auburn coach Butch Thompson at Mississippi State and is now the pitching coach at Austin Peay.
""Usually he's just kind of been that mentor, someone that I look up to,"" Richard Fitts said. ""Just having him there as kind of a coach aspect, telling me some different things that he sees based off of some data and stuff that I send him – everything like that was really big.""
It helped Fitts make a meteoric rise during a pandemic. He hasn't thrown a pitch for Auburn in a real game since March, yet he showed enough during bullpen sessions and fall scrimmages that he's been tabbed a second-team preseason All-American by D1Baseball.
More than that, both D1Baseball and Perfect Game rank Fitts as a top-10 college prospect in 2021. There's a belief that he could follow in the footsteps of Casey Mize and Tanner Burns and be a first-round MLB Draft pick this year.
That mound he and his dad built might be worth something someday.
Said Thompson, ""Somebody like Richard Fitts had his brain wired to be like, 'How do I capture this moment here, this break? And what can I figure out to continue to grow?'""

Mr. Zhang concluded.
Recent Developments 
Impact of COVID-19
The resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic continued to impact the Company's operations and results in the quarter ended December 31, 2021. 
In China, sales growth continued to be challenged by multiple waves of pandemic from late October across the country. The Company estimates that the GMV loss from those influenced stores was comparable to the loss in the previous quarter. Going into the quarter ending March 31, 2022, the Company currently expects the effects of COVID-19 to persist and local governments' zero-tolerance policy to maintain relative strict public health measures in some cities. In overseas markets, 76 stores had not resumed operations as of December 31, 2021, compared to 157 such stores as of September 30, 2021. Although the Company has been observing marginal sales improvements in overseas markets in the past several quarters, it remains cautious in its outlook in terms of sales and store expansion.
Unaudited Financial Results for the Second Quarter of Fiscal Year 2022 ended December 31, 2021
Revenue was RMB2,772.8 million (US$435.1 million), representing an increase of 20.7% year over year, primarily driven by the growth of the Company's domestic operations and the recovery of its international operations. 
Revenue generated from domestic operations was RMB2,055.5 million (US$322.6 million), increasing by 12.0% year over year. Revenue generated from domestic operations of the MINISO brand was RMB1,876.7 million (US$294.5 million), increasing by 6.4% year over year. Revenue generated from the TOP TOY brand was RMB131.1 million (US$20.6 million), compared to RMB2.6 million in the same period of 2020.
Revenue generated from international operations was RMB717.3 million (US$112.6 million), representing an increase of 54.9% year over year, which reflects an improved recovery of sales in international markets.
Revenue per MINISO store, which is calculated by dividing the revenue of the MINISO brand by the average number of MINISO stores of the relevant period, was RMB523.2 thousand (US$82.1 thousand), representing a year-over-year increase of 3.9%. Revenue per MINISO store for the Company's domestic operations decreased by 7.4% year over year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and the dilution effect of the newly added stores in lower-tier cities in China in this quarter, while revenue per MINISO store for our international operations increased by 43.7% year over year.
Cost of sales was RMB1,909.9 million (US$299.7 million), representing an increase of 15.4% year over year. 
Gross profit was RMB862.9 million (US$135.4 million), representing an increase of 34.2% year over year. 
Gross margin was 31.1%, compared to 28.0% in the same period of 2020. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to 1) revenue contribution of international operations increased from 20.1% in the same period of 2020 to 25.9% in this quarter, typically international operations have higher gross margin than domestic operations, and 2) our expanding co-branded IP product offering and its associated higher gross margin in this quarter.
Other income was RMB2.5 million (US$0.4 million), compared to RMB7.8 million in the same period of 2020. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to a decrease in government grants received by the Company in this quarter.
Selling and distribution expenses were RMB384.8 million (US$60.4 million), representing an increase of 12.9% year over year. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, selling and distribution expenses were RMB370.7 million (US$58.2 million), representing an increase of 21.0% year over year. The year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to increased personnel-related expenses, licensing expenses and marketing expenses that were in line with the year-over-year revenue growth and brand awareness improvement for both MINISO and TOP TOY.
General and administrative expenses were RMB221.4 million (US$34.7 million), representing an increase of 17.1% year over year. Excluding share-based compensation expenses, general and administrative expenses were RMB214.7 million (US$33.7 million), representing an increase of 34.0% year over year. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to increased depreciation and amortization expenses of land use right related to the Company's headquarter building project, and to a lesser extent, increased personnel-related expense and professional service fees. 
Other net income was RMB12.3 million (US$1.9 million), compared to other net loss of RMB55.1 million in the same period of 2020. The Company recorded other net loss in the same period of 2020 mainly due to an appreciation of Renminbi against U.S. dollar during that period, which resulted in foreign exchange losses. Increase in investment income also contributed to the change from net loss to net income in this quarter ended December 31, 2021. 
Operating profit was RMB255.4 million (US$40.1 million), compared to RMB54.3 million in the same period of 2020. 
Profit for the period was RMB184.1 million (US$28.9 million), compared to RMB20.8 million in the same period of 2020. 
Adjusted net profit, which represents profit for the period excluding (i) equity-settled share-based payment expenses, and (ii) impairment loss on non-current assets, was RMB214.4 million (US$33.6 million), representing an increase of 155.4% year over year. 
Adjusted net margin was 7.7%, compared to 3.7% in the same period of 2020.
Basic and diluted earnings per American Depositary Share (""ADS"") were RMB0.60 (US$0.08) in the quarter ended December 31, 2021, compared to basic and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.08 in the same period of 2020. Each ADS represents four of the Company's Class A ordinary shares.
Adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ADS were RMB0.72 (US$0.12) in the quarter ended December 31, 2021, compared to adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ADS of RMB0.28 in the same period of 2020.
See the sections entitled ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" and ""Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" in this press release for more information about adjusted net profit, adjusted net margin, and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ADS.
As of December 31, 2021, the combined balance of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and other investments amounted to RMB5,367.1 million (US$842.2 million).
Business Outlook
For the third quarter of fiscal year 2022 ending March 31, 2022, the Company currently estimates its revenue to be between RMB2,400 million and RMB2,700 million, representing an increase of 7.7% to 21.1% year over year. This estimate represents management's current and preliminary views on the market and operational conditions as of the date of this press release, which does not factor in any of the potential future impacts caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and is subject to change.

Exchange Rate
The U.S. dollar (US$) amounts disclosed in this press release, except for those transaction amounts that were actually settled in U.S. dollars, are presented solely for the convenience of the readers. The conversion of Renminbi (RMB) into US$ in this press release is based on the exchange rate set forth in the H.10 statistical release of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System as of December 30, 2021, which was RMB6.3726 to US$1.0000. The percentages stated in this press release are calculated based on the RMB amounts.
Non-IFRS Financial Measures
In evaluating the business, MINISO considers and uses adjusted net profit, adjusted net margin, adjusted basic and diluted earnings per share and adjusted basic and diluted earnings per ADS as supplemental measures to review and assess its operating performance. The presentation of these non-IFRS financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with IFRS. MINISO defines adjusted net profit as profit for the period excluding (i) fair value changes of redeemable shares with other preferential rights, (ii) equity-settled share-based payment expenses, and (iii) impairment loss on non-current assets. MINISO calculates adjusted net margin by dividing adjusted net profit by revenue for the same period. MINISO computes adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per ADS by dividing the adjusted net profit attributable to the equity shareholders of the Company by the number of ADSs represented by the number of ordinary shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation on an IFRS basis and retrospectively adjusting for the effect of the issuance of Series A preferred shares by the Company that are deemed to have been converted into ordinary shares since July 1, 2019. MINISO computes adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per share in the same way it calculates adjusted basic and diluted net earnings per ADS, except that it uses the number of ordinary shares used in the basic and diluted earnings per share calculation on an IFRS basis as the denominator instead of the number of ADSs represented by these ordinary shares.
MINISO presents these non-IFRS financial measures because they are used by the management to evaluate its operating performance and formulate business plans. These non-IFRS financial measures enable the management to assess its operating results without considering the impacts of the aforementioned non-cash and other adjustment items that MINISO does not consider to be indicative of its operating performance in the future. Accordingly, MINISO believes that the use of these non-IFRS financial measures provides useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results in the same manner as the management and board of directors. 
These non-IFRS financial measures are not defined under IFRS and are not presented in accordance with IFRS. These non-IFRS financial measures have limitations as analytical tools. One of the key limitations of using these non-IFRS financial measures is that they do not reflect all items of income and expense that affect MINISO's operations. Further, these non-IFRS financial measures may differ from the non-IFRS information used by other companies, including peer companies, and therefore their comparability may be limited. 
These non-IFRS financial measures should not be considered in isolation or construed as alternatives to profit/(loss), net profit/(loss) margin, basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per share and basic and diluted earnings/(loss) per ADS, as applicable, or any other measures of performance or as indicators of MINISO's operating performance. Investors are encouraged to review MINISO's historical non-IFRS financial measures in light of the most directly comparable IFRS measures, as shown below. The non-IFRS financial measures presented here may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Other companies may calculate similarly titled measures differently, limiting the usefulness of such measures when analyzing MINISO's data comparatively. MINISO encourages you to review its financial information in its entirety and not rely on a single financial measure. 
For more information on the non-IFRS financial measures, please see the table captioned ""Reconciliation of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" set forth at the end of this press release.

396,"Jan. 14Community theater has looked very different over the last year. With virtually all shows since March moving online, it's been a challenge for local creatives.
That's all the more reason to find ways to celebrate, so The Empty Space is soldiering on with its annual awards, moving them online and dubbing them the Schempties.
The name, much like COVID, is meant to be overcome but this year's fete will irreverently celebrate all the hard work, dedication and creativity exhibited by performers and crews from the Oak Street theater.
Festivities include performances, of course, with songs featured from shows from the original schedule that had to be postponed.
Kelsey Morrow will perform ""I Don't Need a Roof"" from ""Big Fish,"" Nick Ono will go ""The Full Monty"" singing ""You Walk with Me"" from that musical and Taylor Lozano brings ""Love to Me"" to life from ""The Light in the Piazza.""
There will be a raffle with an opportunity for each $1 donated to win one of an assortment of prizes including a Starbucks gift basket with coffee and gift card; movie night basket with snacks, card games and Amazon gift card; Killer Kern basket with a portable turntable and merchandise from the local record label; Brighton jewelry (valued over $100); and Empty Space basket with a tie-dyed shirt, handmade themed tumbler, holographic TES sticker and TES art print.
Drawings will be held during the broadcast.
Attendees to the free event are encouraged to dress up, decorate their space and load up on good snacks.
To help with that last task, the theater partnered with local businesses for some treats.
Locale Farm to Table is offering charcuterie boards, for either one to two people ($35) or three to four ($50). Boards can be ordered through the restaurant's website at localefarmtotable.square.site or by calling 322-9090. Orders must be in by 2 p.m. Thursday with pickup from 2 to 4 p.m. Friday.
Be sure to mention The Empty Space in the online notes or tell the person when ordering by phone. A portion of proceeds from sales will benefit the theater.
Tiki-Ko is also teaming up with the theater, offering the Empty Space Slinger, a classic tiki drink made in the spirit of the classic rum barrel.
The cocktail ($10) features lime, grapefruit, orange and pineapple juices, falernum, allspice and honey syrup and grenadine. It comes with an airplane bottle of Kraken rum. For each drink sold, the K Street bar will donate $2 to the theater.
Order the slinger and other libations at tiki-ko.com. Order by noon Saturday for pickup between 6 and 8 p.m. that night.
The awards will be held starting at 7 p.m. Saturday online. Register at esonline.org/empties for access.

The masks are off, but it is still a bit early to say the shows are back on. One of the city’s largest promoters, though, thinks the day that Lawrence is again full of live music is getting nearer.
“I hope people are ready to see some music soon,” said Mike Logan, who owns two of the largest music venues in Lawrence, The Granada and The Bottleneck.
Logan said he thinks there will be some live music shows in Lawrence as early as June, although probably not at his venues. He’s hoping to host a concert in July at the Bottleneck. (Details on the band are not available, and let’s be honest, I’m probably not cool enough to know them anyway.)
Logan anticipates starting concerts in the larger Granada venue in late August. By September, he thinks multiple shows will start arriving in Lawrence.
“I’m feeling like at a minimum we should have eight-plus shows a month to get going, and then start feeling a little more like normal,” Logan said. “Just this morning, I had probably had eight or nine shows inquiring about dates for late in the year.”
A lot could change the situation, with the most obvious being a surge in the virus. But another factor is the pace of reopening in places far from Lawrence. The fact that Douglas County recently lifted its mask mandate doesn’t matter too much in the grand scheme of the music business.
“The industry relies on a national reopening,” Logan said. “A band has to be able to get on a tour bus and go across the country and make it worth their time. They can’t sit and idle.”
The good news is the industry hasn’t seemed to forget Lawrence during the pandemic layoff. Lawrence has long had a live music scene, but it has changed over the years. Promoters say there is still potential for the industry to be a major part of the Lawrence economy, but the city frequently seems on the edge of falling down the list of live music cities.
“It is active right now,” Logan said of the number of calls he’s fielding about possible shows. “Our job is to get as many of these bands to come play Lawrence instead of Columbia or Lincoln or Tulsa or places like that.
“We’re doing that job with probably half our staff. We are not back up to speed on the backside because we still don’t have any revenue.”
Yes, the large federal COVID relief bill did include significant amounts of money for the music and live entertainment industries. But Logan said the rollout of the program has been frustrating. The bill was passed in late December, but businesses weren’t able to make applications until April. The industry is still awaiting word about when money might be awarded.
“We are still working with one hand behind our back,” he said.
The best news, though, are the signs that area residents remain hungry for live music, Logan said.
“I hear from a lot of people who want to just come see a show,” Logan said. “They don’t really care what it is. They just want to see a show. It is a missing component of their life.”
Logan said he understands that well. He said he was recently inside The Bottleneck, which has been closed for months, when he decided to have a technician turn on the sound system.
“I just wanted to hear that noise of a live concert,” Logan said. “I just wanted to feel that thump in my chest.”
Logan also owns the Abe & Jake’s event space near Sixth and New Hampshire streets. It is less of a live music venue and more of a spot for larger community events and fundraisers. Logan said he hopes to start fielding more inquiries about those types of events now that pandemic regulations have loosened. Logan said the venue is still going to require masks in certain situations for a bit longer.
“I think every business is going to have to read their audience and read the customer base for a while,” Logan said.
Thus far, the event business hasn’t been teeming with prospects. Often, those events are planned months in advance, so it will be interesting to see if nonprofits and other frequent hosts of large events get back into planning mode soon. Logan is projecting it will be a while before that part of his business gets back to normal.
“I don’t think we will get anywhere near 2019 levels until mid-2022,” he said.
•••
One other quick note from Logan about his Bottleneck property at 737 New Hampshire St: If you’ve been by the building recently, you’ve probably noticed a large amount of work underway. I originally thought it was just a project for a new roof, but then I saw steel beams starting to protrude from the building over the sidewalk.
“I thought I was just putting a new roof on too,” Logan said, “but then you know how it goes.”
The steel beams aren’t for anything fun, like a covered sidewalk seating area. Instead, structural engineers said they needed to be temporarily put in place to shore up parts of the building. As part of the roof construction, some issues were found that showed parts of the facade needed to be strengthened.
Logan said the building will be fine in the end, but it will end up being a more intensive project than originally expected. He said he’s hoping to qualify for some state tax credits due to the age of the building and the role it plays in the historic downtown district. He said the work will keep the historical lines of the building. He still expects to have the work done in time for a July reopening of the bar and music venue.

Even 30 minutes before tipoff, there was a big-game buzz in the CU Events Center that isn’t often felt for women’s basketball.
The crowd on Friday wasn’t the biggest CU has had in recent years, but it was electric. And, while the No. 22 Buffaloes didn’t beat No. 2 Stanford, the fans were treated to a thriller. Stanford won, 60-52, in a game that came down to the final minutes.
After beating top-ranked Stanford in an empty arena last year, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Buffs soaked up the atmosphere.
“It was just ecstatic,” senior Peanut Tuitele said of the atmosphere. “Last year it was very quiet and we had to create our own energy, but it was really nice to see the Buff nation show and support us.
“I’ve never played in that environment here so it was really nice and I hope that the Buff nation continues to support us because this one game doesn’t define who we are; this loss.”
Official attendance was 3,744, making it the largest crowd for a CU women’s game since 3,781 showed up for a Jan. 28, 2018, game against Oregon State. The previous largest crowd this season was 1,652 for Sunday’s win against UCLA.
The student section was the largest for a CU women’s game in several years.
While the loss itself didn’t define the Buffs, the effort and competitiveness did and head coach JR Payne knows those who came to the Events Center saw two of the best teams in the country.
“I think two really good basketball teams played tonight,” she said. “Two really good teams. Two teams that should be competing at the highest level like we were tonight.”

401,"Aug. 17 - The Williamsburg Police Department will be handing out backpacks filled with school supplies at the Williamsburg Transportation Center at 468 N. Boundary St. from noon to 2 p.m. Aug. 27. The event is open to all Williamsburg-James City County students.
The police department will also be hosting Williamsburg National Night Out from 5-7:30 p.m. Oct. 5. The annual community event ""promotes police-community partnerships and neighborhood camaraderie to make our neighborhoods safer"" according to WPD's Facebook page. It held at 1430 Richmond Road.
The event is free and hamburgers, hot dogs and snacks from local eateries will be provided. The event will also include music, games and safety information.
Library updates COVID protocols
Effective Aug. 17, the Williamsburg Regional Library is temporarily changing its protocols for children's programming and recreation spaces in response to rising COVID cases.
The library said in the release that interactive elements and toys in the children's areas in both library buildings will not be available. The children's area and collection will still be open and available to the public though.
Children's programming changes will also be in place with all in-person, indoor children's programming being canceled, delayed or moved outside. This includes story times, kids' book groups and more that are targeted for children ages 12 and younger.
The library said in the release that the changes were prompted by ""COVID-19 cases rising locally and ongoing concerns about transmission rates among children who are too young to be vaccinated.""
For the most up to date information on programming changes, visit: wrl.org/events.
Colonial Williamsburg acquisition
The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation announced Aug. 17 that they have acquired a rare tankard dated back to 1795 made by Paul Revere, who was a colonial silversmith and prominent figure in the American Revolution.
The tankards were originally used as communal drinking vessels, and there are approximately three dozen Revere tankards known, according to a release by the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation.
The tankard acquired by the foundation is nearly 10 inches tall and holds 48 ounces of liquid.
According to the news release, the tankard is now on display in the exhibition ""Silver from Mine to Masterpiece"" in the Margaret Moore Hall Gallery at the DeWitt Wallace Decorative Arts Museum.
The tankard was acquired by The Friends of Colonial Williamsburg Collections.
'Ales Through the Ages'
The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation will host its ""Ales Through the Ages"" Nov. 12-4. The event will be hosted in-person and virtually, giving guests the opportunity to learn about beer and history.
The keynote speaker will be Pete Brown who will have a discussion on the ""Highs and Lows of Researching Beer History."" Other speakers and programming will talk about the ingredients brewers have used through time.
General registration for in-person is $325, and $100 for virtual registration. Additional add-ons are available for guests and specific events. For the in-person events, there will be a limited in-person capacity.
Registration ends at 11:59 p.m. Oct. 29.

",Williamsburg notebook: Williamsburg Police Department hosts community events
402,"Kids are revved up for summer. Temperatures are sizzling. Masks are off, for the most part, because most of the  coronavirus pandemic restrictions have been lifted.
But wait. The youngest children can't get a COVID-19 vaccine yet. And just about 2 of 5 people eligible have been vaccinated around here, which means a majority haven't.
Will your kids have to be masked all summer? Can you take them into an ice cream parlor?
What about swimming?
To gain some insight, we asked Cincinnati-area infectious disease experts, ""If you have children or grandchildren under age 12, would you do this, doc?""
Here's who responded:
Dr. Jennifer Forrester, associate professor of infectious diseases at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and associate chief medical officer at UC Health.
Dr. Thomas Lamarre, infectious disease specialist, Christ Hospital.
Dr. Robert Frenck, infectious disease specialist and director of the Gamble Vaccine Research Center at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center.
Dr. Dheeraj Goyal, infectious disease specialist, Mercy Health-Infectious Disease, Fairfield.
Here's what we asked, and what they said:
Question:Would you send them to summer day camps that are only outside? Wearing a mask?
A: Forrester: ""We have learned that ventilation helps decrease the risk of acquiring COVID-19. I would allow my children to attend summer camps outside. If they are in close proximity in a large group or indoors, I would want them to put on a mask.""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would do this. Generally speaking, I would not have them wear a mask outside.""
Frenck: ""Kids under 12 still are at risk for COVID. In fact, in the U.S. over the past few weeks, 24% of the new cases of COVID have been in kids. As kids only represent 17% of the population, that means kids are getting infected at a higher rate than expected if infection were equal across age groups. So, at this point, we need to have kids under 12 continue with the same routine of social distancing, masks and good hygiene. By the end of the year, maybe sooner, we hope to have a vaccine for kids 5 years of age and above.
Goyal: ""For children who are older than 12 and are fully vaccinated two weeks prior to the event, it is OK to attend summer day camps outdoors or indoors without wearing a mask. However, for children who are unvaccinated or not yet eligible for vaccination, wearing a mask is still recommended by the CDC if they are older than 2 years of age and if they cannot adequately socially distance from others.
Q: Send them to day camps that are inside a space (for example, a science camp or a drama camp)? Have them wear masks?
A: Forrester: ""If the groups are small and they can maintain a 6-foot distance and wear masks, this would be reasonable (similar to attending school).""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would do this with masking in place.""
Frenck: ""To me, the issue is age of the child, not the space. While it is less risk for transmission outside than inside, it would be very confusing to a child to say, 'In this setting, you need to wear a mask, and in this setting, you don't.' People have asked why public health officials have suggested adults still wear masks if they have kids under 12. That is to not confuse kids. 'Why do I have to wear a mask if daddy, grandma and you don't?' ""
Goyal: ""If the children are between the ages of 2 and 12 years, or are older than 12 but are otherwise unvaccinated, I would recommend they wear a face mask covering face and nose when attending an indoor gathering.""
Q: Would you let them go to a public swimming pool with friends and another family?
A: Forrester: ""We do go to the swimming pool. We've learned over the past year that the water in pools is not a mode of transmission for SARS-CoV2 (COVID-19). My unvaccinated kids still wear a mask if in close proximity to other unvaccinated kids.""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would allow that.""
Frenck: ""I think this is a nuanced question. Going to the public pool, or water park is going to increase risk of transmission as you can't expect a child to wear a mask in the water. If it was a small party (10 or less, as we said for 'land-based' parties), I think the risk would be acceptably low.""
Goyal: ""If the friends and family are fully vaccinated at least two weeks before the event, I would feel comfortable letting my unvaccinated child use an outdoor swimming pool or beach without wearing a mask as long as he or she maintains adequate social distance from people whose vaccination status is unknown.""
Q: Would you wear a mask when you're out with them?
A: Forrester: ""Since I am fully vaccinated, I do not wear a mask when outside and in a smaller crowd with other vaccinated individuals. I do wear a mask inside with larger groups of people when I do not know their vaccine status.""
Lamarre: ""No, I would not wear a mask with them – I am vaccinated.""
Frenck: ""Yes."" (Frenck says in a previous answer that this will provide less confusion for young children. Also, they model adult behavior.)
Goyal: ""Since I am fully vaccinated, I do not need to wear a mask outdoors or indoors, except when required by federal, state or local health laws or regulations, including local businesses, public transportation agencies, healthcare settings and workplace guidance.""
Q: Would you take them to grocery stores or other crowded venues where people are unmasked, inside?
A: Forrester: ""Since my young kids have not yet had the opportunity to be vaccinated, I do not take them to inside locales where unvaccinated people may be unmasked.""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would take them (but would try to avoid if possible) and have them wear a mask.""
Frenck: ""If the children are wearing masks and staying distanced, they should be fine. Again though, if you ask the children to do this, I would model the behavior I want them to do and wear a mask.""
Goyal: ""I do take my child to grocery stores with me, however, since my child is not yet eligible for vaccination, I keep him masked all the time when indoors, try to avoid crowded aisles and maintain adequate social distance from others.""
Q: Would you let them visit vaccinated grandparents? With masks? Without?
A: Forrester: ""We do visit our fully vaccinated grandparents without masks (with their permission, of course). What we know about the vaccines is that they are highly effective at preventing serious disease from COVID-19. So even if the grandparents contracted the virus, they are very unlikely to get seriously ill from it since they had the vaccine series.""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would allow them to visit grandparents – again, if grandparents are vaccinated, then masks are not required. If grandparents not vaccinated, both children and grandparents would have to wear masks.""
Frenck: ""If the grandparents are vaccinated, their risk of getting COVID or transmitting COVID should be very low. If the kids are healthy, they can go visit grandparents and not need to wear a mask. This answer is different from the answers above because ... you know the grandparents are vaccinated.""
Goyal: ""If the grandparents are fully vaccinated, the grandparents do not need to wear a mask while visiting their unvaccinated but otherwise healthy grandchildren. The unvaccinated grandchildren older than 2 years of age, however, should wear their masks, if there are other unvaccinated people around them. This is even more important in indoor or crowded settings.""
Q: Take them to a baseball or soccer game?
A: Forrester: ""Again, these outside venues offer the benefit of good ventilation. We still keep social distance when in crowds where the vaccine status of others is not known, though, and have a mask available for when social distancing becomes difficult.""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would do that.""
Frenck: ""I am assuming you mean a professional game where there will be lots of people. This setting would warrant a mask even more than the camp setting. Parents should discuss with their kids ahead of time and let them know that many people won't be wearing masks. But, we need you to wear a mask to protect yourself and others. The vaccines soon will be available for your age and then we can go back to normal.""
Goyal: ""I would feel comfortable taking my unvaccinated child to a baseball or soccer game outdoors, however, I would advise him to wear a face mask at all times, unless we can maintain adequate social distance from people whose vaccination status is unknown. Fully vaccinated children do not need to wear masks at indoor or outdoor games, if they are two weeks out of the second dose of Pfizer vaccine.""
Q: Let them join friends at an ice cream shop, outside or inside?
A: Forrester: ""I do not let my unvaccinated kids be inside eating (so naturally unmasked) with potentially other unvaccinated individuals. Outside where we can maintain some distance is a better option.""
Lamarre: ""Yes, I would let them pursue those activities – with masking indoors only.""
Frenck: ""I certainly would let them join friends at an ice cream shop or restaurant. However, it should be with small numbers of people and to wear a mask until the time you have the food or ice cream.""
Goyal: ""If all other people in the group are fully vaccinated, I would feel comfortable letting my child join friends or family at an ice cream shop, as long as they stay outside and stay socially distanced from people outside their group. Mask wearing is still advisable for unvaccinated children while indoors, especially when they cannot adequately socially distance from people with unknown vaccination status.""",Unvaccinated children prompt questions about summer activities
403,"Publication: The Chronicle, , Quinnipiac University, Hamden, CTIt‘s a new year, a new presidency and a new semester, but students who attended a discussion about Dr. Martin Luther King‘s life and legacy on Jan. 27, were reminded there is still work to be done.
“The Work Ahead, the Work Within: Reflecting on King’s Dream” was a virtual conversation that honored King’s life, dream and legacy in the context of today.
The Zoom webinar was an intercollegiate event co-sponsored by Yale University, Quinnipiac University, Southern Connecticut State University and Gateway Community College. Yamiche Alcindor, an MSNBC political contributor and White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour, guided the discussion and posed questions to Patrisse Cullors, a community organizer and co-founder of Black Lives Matter, about both King and modern-day issues.

The conversation between Cullors and Alcindor exemplified the interconnectedness between King’s life and the state of the country after the election of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the insurrection at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, and the ramifications of what Cullors described as the “twin pandemics” of racism and COVID-19.
Early in the conversation, Cullors mentioned the importance of reflection and how King was constantly assessing if “what he asked of Black people” at the time was the correct way to move forward. She also explained how King‘s criticism of “white moderates” in particular is relevant today with the change in the White House.
“As we move into a new administration and feel the excitement of no longer having Donald Trump as president, now is the time, more than ever, for us to remain vigilant about white moderates and white moderate politics at how it actually didn’t get us free before Donald Trump and it won’t get us free now,” Cullors said. “I wholeheartedly believe that this administration has to move forward in really creating a Black agenda. I’ll say this over and over again, but until Black people are free, no one else will be able to get free.”
Cullors also talked about how we can learn more about King besides his struggle and was reminded of this when a picture of King in Jamaica circulated online during the namesake’s holiday.
“We kind of froze King in time as an ancestor on a podium, as if he didn’t have a full expansive life,” Cullors said. “He had children, he had a family, he had flaws. I think when we’re able to remember King in his full humanity, we’re able to actually give him more space and breadth and it thus gives other movement leaders more space and breadth.”
Cullors also talked about how the siege on the Capitol was a reminder of the existence of white supremacy and its link in American history.
“I remember watching it and the very first thought I had was ‘Oh my goodness, imagine if that was Black people, imagine if that was Black Lives Matter,’ there’s no way that, one, it wouldn’t be a massacre but, two, folks wouldn’t be arrested in the thousands,” Cullors said. “This action on the Capitol comes from a long legacy of white supremacist mobs trying to upend democracy.”
When recalling the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests during the summer, in the heat of the pandemic, Cullors explained how monumental the moment was in history.
“Black people and our allies went to the streets in the middle of a pandemic to challenge racism,” Cullors said. “People risked their lives to show up for both ourselves and also it was the largest multiracial movement in human history and people felt inclined to show up for what we call the twin crisis, the twin pandemics: racism and COVID. I feel really moved by our movement.”

In the question and answer section of the program, moderator asked an attendant’s question to Cullors and Alcindor that centered on self care and maintaining positive mental health during these turbulent times. Alcindor explained how music from artists like Bill Withers has helped her a lot. She also gave encouraging advice for college students.
“I know that there are probably a lot of college students on here, I just really implore you to try to take a break on yourself,” Alcindor said. “Try to be gentle on yourself … these are times where you cannot spend all day beating yourself up.”
While King was a Black man, the discussion did spend time addressing the dual forms of oppression that Black women face. One response highlighted a university‘s responsibility to have a pipeline of Black women in higher education.
“One of the first things universities need to do is decide if they are willing to recruit, develop, retain and appropriately pay Black women. There’s a lot of universities who say they are and then Black women get there and they don’t continue on the promise,” Cullors said. “This has to be an institution-wide initiative. This cannot be (only) certain individuals at the campus who are excited to bring on Black women, I’ve experienced this myself.”
“
I’ll say this over and over again, but until Black people are free, no one else will be able to get free”
— Patrisse Cullors
Cullors continued by describing the reality that for there to be Black women in leadership positions in companies and predominantly white institutions especially, there must be white people who are moved from those places of authority.
“We are not going to actually change the systems that we live in if we don’t have folks moving out of their seats of power,” Cullors said. “It’s just not gonna happen. So there has to be a real confrontation around whiteness and why there’s sort of an obsession with whiteness at the university, at PWIs in particular.”

, , California State Polytechnic University - Pomona
, Pomona, CAStudents getting vaccinated have caused COVID-19 cases in the Cal Poly community to decline since May.
The last time a student tested positive for the coronavirus through the university’s testing program was May 20, according to Cal Poly’s COVID-19 dashboard. Only four students have tested positive for the coronavirus in the last three weeks.
In an email to Mustang News, Cal Poly spokesperson Matt Lazier attributed the decline in COVID-19 cases to students getting vaccinated and becoming exempt from the mandatory testing program.
On April 27, President Jeffrey Armstrong notified the campus community via email that students who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 and upload vaccination records to their student portal will be exempt from mandatory testing as of May 6.
Lazier said that at the beginning of May, 6,891 students were required to test for COVID-19. At the beginning of June, 2,007 students were required to continue getting tested.
He added that more than 70% of students living on campus are vaccinated and 7,778 students have uploaded vaccination records to their student portals.
Cal Poly’s decline in COVID-19 cases mirrors county trends. In the month of May, 266 people tested positive for the coronavirus in San Luis Obispo County — its smallest monthly count so far in 2021.

Spotify Technology SA has been facing public scrutiny over content from Joe Rogan on its platform after musician Neil Young pulled his music from the streaming service in objection to what he said was misinformation by the company's star podcaster. On Jan. 30, Mr. Rogan responded in a 10-minute Instagram video post and pledged to be more balanced and informed about controversial topics and guests. Spotify earlier that day published its platform policies, which it said were longstanding and developed internally with the help of outside experts.
What is happening around Joe Rogan and Spotify?
The controversy began when Mr. Young, a 76-year-old folk-rock star whose hits including ""Heart of Gold"" and ""Harvest Moon"" have gained hundreds of millions of plays on Spotify, demanded that Spotify remove his music over what he says is vaccine misinformation spread by Mr. Rogan on the streaming service.
Mr. Young published an open letter in which he cited a podcast episode that featured Dr. Robert Malone, a virologist who worked on research into several mRNA Covid-19 vaccines but who is now critical of them. Among the claims made in the episode was the suggestion that hospitals have been financially motivated to falsely diagnose deaths as having been caused by Covid-19.
Spotify responded to Mr. Young's wishes by removing his music, the company confirmed on Jan. 26, after Mr. Young's record label, Warner Music Group Corp.'s Warner Records, formally requested Spotify remove the music.
Spotify Chief Executive Daniel Ek in a blog post on Jan. 30 said there are opinions on both sides of any issue and that he personally disagrees with plenty of individuals and views on Spotify.
""To our very core, we believe that listening is everything,"" he said.
Spotify said that it had signed Mr. Rogan to a deal in May 2020, which The Wall Street Journal reported was worth more than $100 million . There have been tensions around Spotify and the podcaster internally at the company. The Journal reported in October of that year that a thread in Spotify's employee #ethics-club Slack channel centered on Mr. Rogan's episode with Alex Jones, a radio host and the publisher of InfoWars, whose content has been removed from Facebook, Apple, YouTube and Spotify. Employees circulated information on how to flag content for review by Spotify's trust-and-safety team, according to people familiar with the matter.
Mr. Ek, responding to the 2020 controversy , shared his desire to make Spotify the largest audio platform in the world and said that ambition involves embracing diverse voices and differing opinions as the company chases scale in podcasting.
Mr. Ek, at that time, said that applying the rules consistently is his priority.
Who is Joe Rogan?
Mr. Rogan is a comedian and former mixed-martial-arts commentator who has built up his hit podcast, ""The Joe Rogan Experience,"" currently Spotify's most popular podcast .
What did Joe Rogan say in response to the latest controversy?
In a 10-minute Instagram video post late Sunday, Mr. Rogan said, ""If I pissed you off, I'm sorry,"" referring to the growing backlash against him and Spotify.
""It's a strange responsibility to have this many viewers and listeners,"" Mr. Rogan said. ""It's nothing that I've prepared for. I'm going to do my best to balance things out.""
Mr. Rogan said he would have more guests on the show that present different opinions from contrarian ones right after he hosts controversial guests. He thanked Spotify for supporting him and said he is a huge Neil Young fan.
Is anyone else pulling out of Spotify as a result?
Musicians David Crosby and Stephen Stills are joining their former bandmate Mr. Young in his protest against Spotify, saying they want to pull their music from the platform. ""We support Neil and we agree with him that there is dangerous disinformation being aired on Spotify's Joe Rogan podcast,"" Messrs. Crosby and Stills said in a statement on Feb. 2 that also was signed by Graham Nash, another former bandmate. Mr. Nash earlier announced plans to pull his music from Spotify. Musicians Joni Mitchell, Nils Lofgren and India Arie also have sought to remove their music in the past week. Mary Trump, the author and niece of former President Donald Trump, and writer Roxane Gay said they were removing their podcasts from the platform.
What has Neil Young said since Spotify removed his albums?
Mr. Young has directed his fans to use other streaming services including Amazon Music, Apple Music and Qobuz to stream his songs.
In a post on Twitter , Mr. Young provided a link where new subscribers signing up for Amazon.com Inc.'s streaming-music service can receive four months free and then pay $7.99 a month afterward.
How much is Joe Rogan making with Spotify?
Spotify struck a licensing deal with Mr. Rogan in 2020 worth more than $100 million, according to people familiar with the matter.
What action has Spotify taken to prevent misinformation on its platform?
As of Jan. 30, Spotify is beginning to tag Covid-19-related content with an advisory prompting users to check out the service's new ""hub for data-driven facts and up-to-date information"" from the health and scientific communities. ""We haven't been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly,"" said Mr. Ek in a blog post that day. ""It's become clear to me that we have an obligation to do more to provide balance and access to widely accepted information from the medical and scientific communities guiding us through this unprecedented time.""
Dow Jones & Co., publisher of the Journal, has a content partnership with Gimlet Media, a unit of Spotify.
 Neil Young, Joe Rogan Podcast and Spotify: What to Know 
Credit: By Shalom Goodman ","Neil Young, Joe Rogan Podcast and Spotify: What to Know; As the podcaster responds to controversy, here's what to know about tensions surrounding his show"
410,"INDIANAPOLIS – Nearly two decades ago, Scott Drew decided to leave his comfort zone at tiny Valparaiso for the scandal-plagued basketball program at Baylor, explaining to his father that there was nowhere for the Bears to go but up.
Now, they're one win away from the top.
Led by Jared Butler and the rest of their brilliant backcourt, a defense that refused to give Houston an inch, and a coach intent on making the most of his first trip to the Final Four, the Bears roared to a 78-59 victory Saturday night in their first appearance in the NCAA Tournament semifinals in 71 long years.
""Every day you're grinding, and you don't really look back. You're pressing forward,"" Drew said, ""but I'm so blessed to have these unbelievable players that bought into what we like to do with the program.""
Or, as Butler put it: ""This is what we came to Baylor to do.""
Butler scored all 17 of his points in the first half, but just about everyone from Baylor (27-2) got in on the act, with five players scoring in double figures. They doubled up Houston after 10 minutes, built a 45-20 lead by halftime and coasted the rest of the way in the first Final Four showdown between schools from the Lonestar State.
They'll face Gonzaga, the overall No. 1 seed, or upstart UCLA on Monday night for their first national championship.
""That was one of my goals, to leave a legacy at Baylor,"" Butler said. ""And you have to win national championships. You have to win. You have to be a great program, be about great things, and that's what we're doing.""
Marcus Sasser had 20 points for the cold-shooting Cougars (28-4), whose dream path to their first Final Four since 1984 – they faced teams seeded 15th, 10th, 11th and 12th along the way – ended with a whimper against a team focused squarely on this night since the moment last year's tournament was canceled because of the pandemic.
For Drew, the wait had been even longer. He took over a program 18 years ago embroiled in arguably the biggest controversy in the history of the sport: the graphic shooting death of player Patrick Dennehy, his teammate Devon Dotson pleading guilty to his murder, attempts by then-coach Dave Bliss to cover it all up, and NCAA sanctions that lasted well into Drew's own tenure.
Yet somehow, the son of longtime Valpo coach Homer Drew always pictured the very scene that unfolded Saturday night: His team playing selflessly, almost effortlessly, never once feeling the pressure of college basketball's biggest stage.
Well, there were a few things Drew probably didn't picture.
Instead of 70,000 fans reaching to the rafters, the Bears were cheered in the lower bowl by thousands of cardboard cutouts – from the late Georgetown coach John Thompson to New Mexico State mascot Pistol Pete – due to measures against COVID-19 that have forced them to live in a bubble for the last three weeks.
The roughly 8,000 fans that were allowed through the doors, socially distanced in a vast ocean of blue seats, provided a muted soundtrack to the blowout inside the cavernous home of the Indianapolis Colts.

TOKYO—The Tokyo Olympics will be held without spectators, the organizers said, after Japan declared a new state of emergency that will continue through the end of the Games due to a rise in Covid-19 infections.
Hundreds of athletes and officials from around the world have already arrived for the Olympics, which open on July 23. Foreign spectators were ruled out in March , but the organizers had intended to allow stadiums and arenas to be around half capacity with local fans.
More than 3.5 million tickets have been purchased by people in Japan for the Olympics, which run through Aug. 8. Most of those tickets would have remained valid.
The plan was upended by a surge in infections in Japan this week, which prompted Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to put Tokyo under a state of emergency starting Monday and lasting until Aug. 22, the fourth emergency period since the start of the pandemic.
Shortly after Mr. Suga declared the emergency on Thursday, representatives of Tokyo Olympic organizers, the International Olympic Committee and the Japanese government met and agreed to bar all spectators.
""We need to issue a message which is strong and easy to understand from the point of view of preventing further spread of infection,"" said Seiko Hashimoto, the head of the Tokyo organizing committee.
Japan and some other countries in Asia that have been slow to roll out vaccinations are experiencing new waves of infection, exacerbated by the more contagious Delta variant . Infection rates remain low compared with some harder-hit countries , but the sudden increases are worrying governments and medical professionals.
On Thursday, the city of Tokyo reported 896 new infections, up 27% from a week earlier. Neighboring South Korea reported 1,275 new infections nationwide on Thursday, the highest number of daily cases since the start of the pandemic.
Opinion polls show the Japanese public remains concerned that the Olympics will contribute to the spread of infection. Tens of thousands of athletes, officials and others connected to the Games will travel to Japan for the event.
Organizers say most of those arriving in Japan will have been vaccinated, and strict limits on their movements have been imposed. They will also face frequent Covid-19 testing. Among those who arrived on Thursday was IOC President Thomas Bach, who will spend his first three days in his hotel room like others who come for the Games.
""I think we can only be very satisfied with the stricter measures having been established to protect everybody,"" he said, speaking at the meeting via video link.
Still, some of the early arrivals for the Games are revealing weaknesses in Covid protocols. Three members of foreign delegations have tested positive for Covid-19, including one from Uganda who tested negative on arrival but positive a few days later after traveling to the city hosting the team's training camp.
Highlighting the particular concern about the Games in Japan, even under the new state of emergency, events such as games in Japan's professional baseball and soccer leagues will be allowed to continue with spectator levels at reduced capacity.
 The ban on spectators at the Olympics has some exceptions for events that will be held at venues outside of the Tokyo region. For example, spectators will be allowed at events at the cycling velodrome around 60 miles southwest of Tokyo. The velodrome is in a region that hasn't been hit as hard by infections. The organizers have already asked people not to come and watch the marathon races that will take place in the city of Sapporo, on Japan's northern island of Hokkaido.
The decision to bar spectators means the Japanese organizers will forfeit almost all of the $800 million in revenue they had expected from ticket sales.
Tokyo's new state of emergency requires restaurants to close early and not serve alcohol. People will also be asked to avoid unnecessary trips, but as in previous cases public transport will keep operating and most stores will remain open.
In South Korea, authorities had been preparing to relax social-distancing measures, but outbreaks among people in their 20s and 30s prompted them to extend the restrictions until next week. Delta variant infections have doubled there over the past week.

412,"SAN JOSE, CALIF.  Matt Boldy was trying to catch up on schoolwork earlier this week after returning from the NCAA tournament, but that's not all that was on the Boston College sophomore's mind.
Boldy was also deciding his hockey future.
""A lot of stress,"" he said. ""But other than that, the fact it all worked out and all worked out in the fashion it did was incredible.""
After two seasons with the Eagles, Boldy signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the Wild. He'll begin his pro career with Iowa, reporting to the American Hockey League after completing COVID-19 testing and quarantine requirements in Minneapolis.
""It's super exciting,"" Boldy said. ""It's a dream come true. For me, it's another step closer to the ultimate goal that every kid sets when they're little.""
The Wild presented Boldy with two contract options, a deal that began immediately or one that would start next season.
By continuing to play, Boldy can build on what's already been a productive season for the 19-year-old. In 22 games, he recorded 11 goals and 20 assists and was recognized as a Hobey Baker Award top 10 finalist.
""Developmentally it was huge for me, especially confidence-wise,"" he said.
Despite debuting at Boston College as a prized prospect drafted 12th overall by the Wild in 2019, Boldy started slowly and didn't make the team that represented the United States at the 2020 IIHF World Junior Championship.
""It was shaky for a little,"" he said, ""and obviously my game wasn't where it is now.""
But Boldy rallied, learning from the adversity and emerging as one of the nation's top scorers early in his sophomore season and then shining at the 2021 World Juniors, where he helped Team USA win a gold medal.
""That's what you want to see, his line of development going up, and I think he's doing that,"" Wild General Manager Bill Guerin said. ""We're on the right track, and we feel very good about where he is right now.""
At the World Juniors, Boldy tied for the team lead in goals with five.
""I was there to try and prove some people wrong,"" Boldy said, ""just kind of go out there, play my game and show everyone who I am as an all-around player.""
Guerin believes the 6-foot-2, 195-pound Boldy will have to get quicker and stronger like all young players do, but he feels Boldy is ""a very important piece"" in the Wild's puzzle.
""He's got hockey sense,"" Guerin said. ""He's got size. He's got playmaking ability. He's got a lot of great tools. It's just a matter of putting them all together at the next level.""
With Iowa, Boldy hopes to demonstrate his skill and smarts. He feels he can play wing and center and ultimately, Boldy will dictate when he gets to the NHL ­ through his stats, how consistently he plays and his demeanor.
Individual focusBoldy is among the latest from that 2021 World Juniors squad to sign a pro contract, joining the likes of Cole Caufield (Montreal) and Trevor Zegras (Anaheim). But Guerin told Boldy to focus solely on his journey.
""I know there's that internal competition between those guys and the pressure that they put on themselves,"" Guerin said. ""But we want to take all the pressure we can off Matt and just let him develop and play hockey.""
Olympic opportunityGuerin also played for Team USA, suiting up for two World Juniors, two World Cups and three Olympics, and he added another milestone to his international resume Wednesday when he was named the assistant GM of the 2022 U.S. Olympic men's hockey team.
Chicago GM Stan Bowman was named GM.
""As a player, it was always a huge honor to put on the USA jersey,"" Guerin said. ""I always took it very seriously and like Stan, I'm a product of the 1980 generation and it was something that drove me. So, in this capacity, I'm honored to be representing USA Hockey again.""
At the 2002 Olympics hosted by Salt Lake City, Guerin won silver after the U.S. lost the gold-medal game to Canada.

413,"Publication: The Spectrum, , Sacred Heart University, Fairfield, CTI cannot express how much I do not want to write about this topic, but not to do so would be irresponsible in lieu of the recent Atlanta shooting on March 16, where six of the eight people shot were Asian women.
In my first draft of this editorial, I wrote about this topic in a purely factual way in order to protect myself amidst a wave of anti-Asian sentiment across the world, but with the platform I have at the moment, it might be beneficial to share my feelings as an Asian-American woman despite the fact that I’m putting a target on my back.
Before I begin, I would like to clearly preface this by saying that I do not represent the thoughts of the Asian-American community as a whole, but only advocate my own ideas and experiences.
As a Chinese adoptee, I have always been surrounded by people who do not look like me. I went to school in primarily white institutions. I wanted to be white more than anything just so I wouldn’t be called a “chink” or be asked if I eat dog.
You would think that it would be different as the years went on and people became more educated about different cultures, but it hasn’t changed at all. In fact, it’s worse than ever before.
Instead of being verbally harassed, I now get to fear for my life.
According to TIME, “The NYPD reported that hate crimes motivated by anti-Asian sentiment jumped 1,900% in New York City in 2020. Stop AAPI Hate, a reporting database created as a response to the increase in racial violence, received 2,808 reports between March 19 and Dec. 21, 2020.”
These attacks are primarily directed toward women and elders who do not often have the means to protect themselves. The anti-Asian rhetoric can be traced back to former President Donald Trump, who tried to pass off his use of “Chinese virus” as a joke despite knowing beforehand that he was a major influence in American society.
In fact, according to a Washington Post article, it was reported that #chinesevirus and #covid-19 increased 10 times on Twitter with a mostly negative connotation after Trump first used the term “Chinese virus.”
The anti-Asian sentiment does not stop there either. It happens on campus too.
The first time it was reported was the spring 2020 semester when “someone yelled ‘coronavirus’ at an Asian member of our community.”
It’s probably not the first time either, as I have also faced the same kind of discrimination on campus.
When I was sitting in Hawley Lounge in March 2020, I overheard a conversation between two students talking about their plans for the upcoming spring break.
“Where are you going for vacation? Hope it’s not Wuhan,” said one.
They shared a laugh before the other noticed me in the corner and told their friend to shut up since “there’s an Asian girl right there.”
That was the first time in recent years that someone has made me insecure of not only my identity as an Asian-American, but also my safety, especially with the recent attacks against Asian-Americans.
While I don’t think I could ever summarize the feelings of the entire Asian-American community singlehandedly, I think I might come close when I simply say that I’m tired.

417,"With 13 players committed to Division I colleges, including perhaps the No. 1 players at pitcher and shortstop in the Southland, San Juan Capistrano JSerra has been eager to play an official high school baseball game for months. Last year's team was 11-1 when the season was halted because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
How good is this year's team?
""This team has the chance to be the best just because what's on the mound,"" coach Brett Kay said.

Left-hander Gage Jump, who has signed with UCLA, has a 92-mph fastball and three other effective pitches, making him the pitcher most to fear in 2021. He's been good since he was a freshman and found ways to get better during an 11-month youth sports shutdown. He lifted weights at home, threw long toss with his older brother, who plays for Arizona State, and became even more convinced that being 5 feet 11 means nothing for a pitcher.
""I don't care if I'm 5-8 or 6-4. I think I'm 6-10 out on the mound,"" he said.
Though Jump is good, there are others to count on. Eric Silva, a transfer from Laguna Beach who signed with UCLA, will be available on April 23 after the sit-out period. He throws in the 90s. David Horn, a UCLA commitment from the class of 2022, transferred from Murrieta Valley. Freshman Matt Champion is committed to Arizona State.
Then there's shortstop Cody Schrier, who has also signed with UCLA. If there's one position that you can count on JSerra being good at it, it's shortstop, where Schrier follows the likes of Chase Strumpf, Royce Lewis and Michael Curialle. Strumpf was All-Pac-12 at UCLA, Lewis was the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft and Curialle is starting in the outfield for UCLA.
In his senior year, Schrier is poised to hit for power and average while being consistently good as a fielder. He has played against top competition and usually thrives under pressure.
Schrier said he traveled on airplanes more than 15 times during the summer and fall to play in out-of-state showcases and tournaments while wearing a mask. ""We were super cautionary and quarantined when we needed to,"" he said.
Schrier said the team's group of talented seniors who lost to Manhattan Beach Mira Costa 1-0 in a heartbreaking playoff game in 2019 as sophomores and then were denied a chance to avenge that defeat in 2020 remain focused on the job ahead.
""We've been ready,"" he said. ""We're just hoping to get in a season. It's a really talented group of kids with good camaraderie. I think it's special for this to be our senior year and hopefully go out with a bang. Our talent is off the charts.""
Of course, the coronavirus and travel restrictions within California make it uncertain where things might stand come June when playoffs are supposed to take place. JSerra isn't standing pat. The team intends to travel within the boundaries allowed in Southern California to play the best, starting with a season opener Friday against Corona.
Kay wants his players to get the most out of a 2021 season after almost a year of no luck. ""They have a chance to be the best team we've ever had,"" he said.
There's plenty of opponents looking forward to the challenge of trying to topple the Lions. Chino Hills Ayala has nine returning starters. Yucaipa has nine Division I commits. Studio City Harvard-Westlake has a pair of highly touted freshman pitchers in Bryce Rainer and Duncan Marsten, who are committed to UCLA and Stanford, respectively. Orange Lutheran and Santa Margarita have the pitching pieces to make a stand in the Trinity League.
In the City Section, Van Nuys Birmingham is the three-time defending champion. Gavin Taylor was the pitcher last season as a freshman who helped hand JSerra its only loss. Chris Romero pitched in the 2019 final at Dodger Stadium. Dom Cervantes is an outfielder who started in right field at Dodger Stadium as a freshman.
Wilmington Banning returns the No. 1 pitcher in the City Section in left-hander Anthony Joya, who signed with Cal State Fullerton.
There's uncertainty whether there will be Southern Section playoffs, but the City Section intends to have playoffs and Dodger Stadium remains a possibility for the championship game.

It would boost checksto $2,000, send aid to local, state governments
President-elect Joe Biden said Friday that he is assembling a multitrillion-dollar relief package that would boost stimulus payments for Americans to $2,000, extend unemployment insurance and send billions of dollars in aid to city and state governments, moving swiftly to address the nation's deteriorating economic condition and the rampaging pandemic.
The package will also include billions of dollars to improve vaccine distribution and tens of millions of dollars for schools, as well as rent forbearance and assistance to small businesses, especially those in low-income communities, Biden said at a news conference in Wilmington, Del.
""We need to provide more immediate relief for families and businesses now,"" Biden said.
""The price tag will be high,"" he said, adding, ""The overwhelming consensus among leading economists left, right and center is that in order to keep the economy from collapsing this year, getting much, much worse, we should be investing significant amounts of money right now.""
Biden said he would lay out the package in more detail next week. It would build on some $4 trillion in economic assistance Congress has already devoted to battling the devastating pandemic, including a $900 billion package President Trump signed into law last month.
Discussions were getting underway in earnest with Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill, with Biden aiming to move the package to a vote as quickly as possible. But in an early sign of the challenges Biden may face in getting his agenda through Congress, even with both chambers controlled by Democrats, Sen. Joe Manchin III (D-W.Va.) expressed skepticism Friday about the benefits of a new round of stimulus checks.
""I don't know where in the hell $2,000 came from,"" Manchin said. ""I swear to God I don't. That's another $400 billion dollars.""
Manchin initially seemed to suggest in an interview with The Washington Post that he was ""absolutely"" opposed to a new round of checks. He clarified in a follow-up interview that he could potentially support more checks if they were narrow in scope and targeted for people who really need them.
Manchin also said the first priority needed to be getting people vaccinated, not sending out checks.
""If they can direct money and they say, 'This will help stimulate the economy,' hell yeah I'm for it,"" Manchin said. ""But basically right now, you better get them vaccinated.""
Biden has made new stimulus checks a central promise, specifically telling Georgia voters that they would be getting $2,000 payments if Democrats won Senate runoff elections in the state this week.
Democrats won those races, clinching a majority in the Senate and unified control of Washington for the first time since the start of the Obama administration. After the Georgia wins, the incoming majority leader, Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), also pledged that the $2,000 checks would be an early priority.
Manchin is a moderate who will hold great sway in a Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans. With such slim margins, Biden and Schumer may not be able to lose even a single Democratic vote if they attempt to move legislation under special Senate rules that allow bills to pass with a simple majority, instead of the 60-vote margin generally required. In the event of a tie in the Senate, Kamala D. Harris, the incoming vice president, would cast the deciding vote.
Without united Democratic support, Biden would need to attract Republican votes for his proposal. Biden has often spoken of a desire for bipartisanship, but many Republicans are certain to balk at a price tag Biden said would be ""in the trillions of dollars.""
Formal discussions between Democratic congressional leaders and Biden officials on the details of the stimulus package are expected to begin in coming days. Officials stressed that conversations are preliminary and that no final decisions have been made about the timing or exact shape of the effort.

The local-aid component of the package may take the form of additional money for specific needs that governments face, such as funding for education and child care, rather than direct grants to states and cities.
Biden's push for a big new stimulus package comes amid a rapid deterioration of the economy under the strain of a third surge of the coronavirus. The economy shed 140,000 jobs in December, a steep decline just as U.S. covid-19 deaths hit an all-time high.
""Clearly, there's a need. The new unemployment numbers are shocking,"" said Jim Kessler, an executive vice president at Third Way, a centrist think tank. ""State and local aid has to be part of it. There will be additional stimulus checks. And you have to make sure unemployment benefits continue as well.""
Enhanced unemployment benefits of up to $300 a week were included in the $900 billion package signed by Trump. That package also included $600 stimulus checks, so approving new $1,400 checks would bring stimulus payments to $2,000, a figure that has attracted widespread support.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) pushed a stand-alone stimulus-check measure through the House last month. Biden indicated Friday, however, that he would wrap the stimulus checks into a wide-ranging package, not try to move them as a stand-alone bill.
Biden is also likely to push for a larger legislative effort later in 2021 after the initial stimulus package. That effort is expected to focus on spending trillions of dollars on infrastructure and clean-energy jobs. The former vice president additionally has pushed for significant overhauls to America's health-care system, something that could also be wrapped into legislation later in the year.
Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), incoming chair of the Senate Finance Committee, said in an interview that he will push for a restoration of the $600 per week in federal unemployment benefits approved by Congress in March. 

""I talked to [Biden officials] last night. I can tell you they are very much concerned about layoffs,"" Wyden said. ""At this point, I'm telling everybody: 'I'm pulling out all the stops for $600.' . . . We are going to do everything we can to put hard-hit working families on an economic footing where they can get ahead.""

422,"Publication: Daily Evergreen, , Washington State University , Pullman, WALocal businesses in Whitman County are adjusting to operating under Washington state COVID-19 Phase 2 guidelines after the county moved down a phase last week.
In Phase 2, businesses are only allowed to operate at 25 percent capacity indoors, said Tawny Szumlas, Rico’s Public House owner. In Phase 3, businesses can operate at 50 percent capacity.
However, Rico’s Public House still operated at 25 percent when the county was in Phase 3, she said.
“No matter the phase, you are required to have tables 6 feet apart,” she said. “I have exactly 6 feet between tables. Even in Phase Three, we‘ve only ever sat 25 percent because I can‘t make more room.”
Similar to Rico’s Public House, South Fork Public House also operated at 25 percent in Phase 3 because of limited space. Kris Nearents, front of house manager, said he is worried fewer people will want to dine in during Phase 2.
“In the day-to-day business, it actually won‘t affect us too much other than the possibility of people‘s perception,” he said. “If things seem to be getting worse again, you may see less people coming out, going out to restaurants, especially on busier nights.”
Pups & Cups operated at 50 percent in Phase 3. Owner CJ Robert said she is frustrated Whitman County moved back to Phase 2 and believes the decision was made too late to combat the surge effectively.
Cougar Cottage owner Bob Cady said moving back a phase is not great for business. Operating at 25 percent capacity means the restaurant will barely break even.
“25 percent occupancy is just enough to cover the cost of staffing and bills,” he said.
Cady said it is not fair to blame the recent spike in COVID-19 cases wholly on WSU students and believes some WSU administrators have inconsistent messaging about university protocols.
The university missed its window to influence student behavior when it comes to the pandemic, he said. Certain COVID-19 protocols put in place for the spring semester, like mandatory testing, should have started in the fall.
Robert said she is grateful for loyal customers and is excited for people to enjoy the warm weather and use Pups & Cups’ new outdoor seating area.
“If Pullman can work together and stay safe, we can move back to Phase 3 on May 7,” she said. “We can all get back to some semblance of normal here soon but it really comes down to whether or not people are taking [the pandemic] seriously.”

BOSTON - For the first time in 200 years, Boston voters have narrowed the field of mayoral candidates to two women of color who will face off against each other in November.
City Councilors Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George topped the five-person race in Tuesday's preliminary runoff. They bested acting Mayor Kim Janey, City Councilor Andrea Campbell and John Barros, the city's former economic development chief. All five were candidates of color - a major shift away from two centuries of Boston politics dominated by white men.
Wu's parents immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan. Essaibi George describes herself as a first generation Arab Polish-American.
Whoever wins on Nov. 2 will make history in a city that has never elected a woman or Asian American mayor. Wu and Essaibi George's advancement to the general election ushers in a new era for the city which has wrestled with racial and ethnic strife.
Essaibi George said she was confident she could pose a significant challenge to Wu in November.
""I am so grateful to you showing up not just tonight but showing up for the last eight months,"" she told supporters.
Wu spoke to reporters outside Boston City Hall on Wednesday.
""This is the moment in Boston that our campaign and our coalition has been calling for for a long time,"" she said. ""We got in this race over a year ago - actually exactly a year ago today - to ensure that Boston would step up to meet this moment.""
France attacks trial: The key defendant in the 2015 Paris attacks trial said Wednesday the coordinated killings were in retaliation for French airstrikes on the Islamic State group, calling the deaths of 130 innocent people ""nothing personal"" as he acknowledged his role for the first time.
Salah Abdeslam, who wore all black and declined to remove his mask, has been silent throughout the investigation. Observers were waiting to see if he would offer any details during the trial. 
Nine Islamic State group gunmen and suicide bombers struck within minutes of one another at several Paris locations on Nov. 13, 2015. It was the deadliest violence to strike France since World War II and among the worst terror attacks to hit the West, shaking the country's sense of security and rewriting its politics.
Koreas tensions: The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Wednesday criticized South Korea's president and threatened a ""complete destruction"" of bilateral relations after both countries tested ballistic missiles hours apart. 
The launches of missiles underscored a return of tensions between the rivals at a time when talks aimed at stripping North Korea of its nuclear program are stalled.
Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, criticized South Korean President Moon Jae-in for comments he made while observing his country's missile tests, including its first of a submarine-launched ballistic missile. 
Moon said South Korea's growing missile capabilities will serve as a ""sure deterrence"" against North Korean provocations.
The tests came hours after the South Korean and Japanese militaries said North Korea had fired two ballistic missiles into the sea.
The South Korean and Japanese militaries said the two short-range ballistic missiles fired by North Korea flew 500 miles before landing in the sea inside Japan's exclusive economic zone - a worrying development even though they did not reach Japanese territorial waters. 
Hours after the latest North Korean launches, South Korea reported its first test of a submarine-launched ballistic missile. As Moon and other top officials looked on, the missile flew from a submarine and hit a designated target, Moon's office said. It did not say how far the weapon flew.
Prince Andrew: Attorneys representing a U.S. woman who claims Prince Andrew sexually assaulted her have asked British courts to formally notify him about her lawsuit after a lawyer for the prince maintained this week that Andrew has not been properly notified of the ""baseless"" civil action.
Britain's High Court accepted the request from lawyers for Virginia Giuffre to formally contact Andrew about the lawsuit launched in America.
According to the lawsuit filed last month in New York federal court, Giuffre repeated claims she has made publicly about the prince, saying Andrew abused her on multiple occasions in 2001 when she was younger than 18.
In late 2019, Andrew told the BBC ""Newsnight"" program that he never had sex with Giuffre, saying, ""It didn't happen.""
At a hearing in New York on Monday, Giuffre's lawyer had argued that the prince was already properly served when documents formally notifying him of the lawsuit were handed over to a Metropolitan Police officer at the main gates of Andrew's home in Windsor Great Park on Aug. 27.
But Andrew Brettler, representing the prince at the first court proceeding to result from the lawsuit, told Judge Lewis A. Kaplan that Andrew had not properly been served. 
College admissions bribery: A former Georgetown University tennis coach accused of accepting more than $2 million in bribes to help kids get into the school will plead guilty in the sweeping college admissions scandal, according to court documents filed Wednesday.
Gordon Ernst's decision to plead guilty comes as the first trial in the massive case that ensnared wealthy parents and athletic coaches is underway. Ernst, who was scheduled to go on trial in November, agreed to admit to charges including conspiracy to commit federal programs bribery, according to the court records. His attorney declined to comment on Wednesday. 
Prosecutors agreed to recommend a sentence of no more than four years in prison, according to the plea agreement. Ernst has promised to ask for no less than a year behind bars.
SpaceX launch: SpaceX's first private flight blasted off Wednesday night with two contest winners, a health care worker and their rich sponsor, the most ambitious leap yet in space tourism.
It was the first time a rocket streaked toward orbit with an all-amateur crew - no professional astronauts.
The Dragon capsule's two men and two women are looking to spend three days circling the world from an unusually high orbit - 100 miles higher than the International Space Station - before splashing down off the Florida coast this weekend. 
Leading the flight is Jared Isaacman, 38, who made his fortune with a payment-processing company he started in his teens. It's SpaceX founder Elon Musk's first entry in the competition for space tourism dollars.

425,"NEW HAVEN — Toad’s Place, along with some other legendary local nightspots, is back open, and while you need to have proof of a COVID-19 vaccination or a negative COVID test dated within three days in order to get in, Toad’s actually will sell you an instant test at the door, assuming they have them.
You can swab the inside of your nose and get the results while you wait.
Amid concerns about the highly transmissable delta variant — and a city executive order put in place Aug. 6 that requires the use of masks in all indoor public spaces — Toad’s  even will let you buy your own test on the way to the show, bring it with you and show the bouncers the results when you get there.

New Haven PD: 3 city residents shot over weekend
Just don’t count on being able to find the test when you need one.
As of Friday, several downtown drug stores were sold out — although they were in stock at some stores  farther afield in the city and in some neighboring communities.
The Rite Aid at Church and Crown streets was sold out.
On Friday, the price sticker — $23.99 — and stock number for the two-test packages were on a shelf in the drug store. But the shelf above the sticker was empty.
At the CVS drugstore at Whalley Avenue and Orchard Street, the story was pretty much the same:  Nothing but a price sticker beneath an empty shelf.
And across downtown at the Walgreen’s drugstore at 88 York St. near Yale New Haven Hospital, the store appeared to have just three two-test kits of another brand, the Pixel Home Collection Kit, in stock for $24.99 each.
The Walmart store on Foxon Boulevard had one Binax test kit in stock Friday afternoon.
This came as no surprise to Toad’s owner Brian Phelps — and in fact, Toad’s, which finally reopened Aug. 20, was partially responsible for the fact that the test kits are in short supply.
“We go all over the place trying to get those,” Phelps said. “We’re still waiting for our mass order to come in.
“A lot of places are sold out,” he said, but “they get them all the time.”
While requirements that patrons prove they have been vaccinated or have had a recent negative test are in place in a number of other New Haven area nightsports, including BAR, the Shubert Theatre,  College Street Music Hall and the Space Ballroom in Hamden, Toad’s may be the only one providing instant test kits at the door.
Keith Mahler of Premier Concerts and Manic Presents, which operate both the College Street Music Hall and the Space Ballroom, said things have been going great so far at both venues, but he has no plans to offer instant test kits.
“Absolutely not,” he said. “Nobody’s getting in unless you’re vaccinated” or have a recent COVID-19 test result.
“Either you take a vaccination or you take a test far in advance.”
Premier has “a great partnership with probably the best health pass in the country, Bindle,” Mahler said. “We try to get all the fans on Bindle.”
Bindle, a phone app, bills itself as “a secure wallet for your health records and an easy way to privately share your COVID health status with others.”
So far, “It’s going fantastically in terms of fan cooperation,” Mahler said. “People are complying with the rules.

New Haven couple’s mission is right in their new store’s name: ‘Black Corner’
“It’s the only way” he said of requiring that patrons either be vaccinated or take a test in advance of coming to a show. “There’s no exceptions — there’s absolutely no exceptions.”
The owners and managers of the other venues, including BAR, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The owner of Cafe Nine, Paul Mayer, declined comment , saying he was tired of talking about  COVID protocols.
Phelps said the tests are easy to use.
“Basically, you stick a thing up you nose” then “you stick it inside these cardboard things,” he said. If one line shows after a few minutes, you’re COVID negative. If two lines show, you’re positive, he said.
As of when he spoke earlier in the week, “we do have them at the door,” Phelps said. But “we had to go to a lot of stores to get them. We got them from Walmart, Walgreens, CVS — a lot of the drugstores have ’em,” he said. “I know Rite Aid does.”
Phelps said Toad’s generally has gotten good compliance with the city’s mask mandate.
“We have signs everywhere — in the front window and then around the whole club,” Phelps said. While the city Health Department gave Toad’s a bunch of posters to post within the club, “they were pretty wordy,” he said.
So Toad’s has simplified the message to a simple “MASKS ON” in big, block letters, he said.
“Most of the places in the industry are doing it,” he said of the requirement that patrons show proof of vaccination or a recent COVID-19 test in order to enter. “All the Live Nation venues are doing it.
“Hopefully, it will instill in people” a desire to get vaccinated, he said. “Once they’re vaccinated, it’s good for up to a year.”

The statewide percent positivity for the week of Aug. 13 to Aug. 19 increased to 7.8 percent from 6.9 percent.
",County up 35 confirmed cases Friday
430,"Feb. 16Michigan on Tuesday added 775 cases of COVID-19 and 19 deaths as a result of the coronavirus.
The latest reported figures bring Michigan's total number of cases to 576,264 and deaths to 15,177 since the virus was first detected in March, according to the state Department of Health and Human Services.
Despite the reported clusters of cases, Michigan has been experiencing a downward trend in other coronavirus data.
Last week, the state totaled 6,576 cases and 256 deaths, the lowest weekly case total in the previous 18 weeks. The week before, Michigan recorded 8,407 new cases and 293 deaths.
At the end of November, the state established the weekly record of 50,892 cases. The weekly record of 808 deaths was recorded in mid-December.
Data on hospitalizations, testing and new cases all trended in hopeful directions as well as the state appears to be moving past a second wave that hit in late November. The percentage of COVID-19 tests bringing positive results dropped to 4.5%, down from 5.7% in January.
One region, the Upper Peninsula, is below 3% and 82 of the state's 83 counties have a positivity rate below 10%, according to the state.
During the week of Feb. 6, Michigan had the 23rd-highest number of cases in the nation and the 20th-highest death rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control's COVID data tracker.
Michigan ranks 37th in the nation for most hospitalizations and 16th for most patients in intensive care units, according to Becker's Hospital Review.
In Michigan, 6.3% of hospital beds are occupied by coronavirus patients, a 72% decrease from the December peak, health officials said.
As of Tuesday, the state has a total of 67 cases of the virus variant B.1.1.7.: 39 cases in Washtenaw County, 10 in Wayne County, four in Calhoun and Kalamazoo counties, three in Detroit and one each in Charlevoix, Eaton, Kent, Macomb, Sanilac, St. Clair and Van Buren counties.
Vaccines rolled out in phases
As the vaccine continues to be rolled out in phases, the state said it remains committed to having 50,000 shots administered per day as supplies increase, with a goal to get 70% of the population ages 16 and older, about 5.6 million people, vaccinated ""as soon as possible.""
But they said the plan can't be fully implemented until the state receives more doses of vaccine from the federal government.
The current phase allows for the 65 and older age group to receive a dose of vaccine as well as front-line workers such as first responders, some state and federal workers and jail and prison staff. Pre-K through 12th-grade teachers and childcare providers also are eligible for vaccinations.
The state health department announced a program Monday with initiatives to help vaccinate more vulnerable Michigan residents, Dr. Joneighn Khaldun, the state's chief medical executive said in a Monday press release.
Starting this week, mortuary service workers, who routinely work with infectious materials, are eligible to be vaccinated. Also, 41 federally qualified health centers in medically underserved areas will receive vaccines to aid people 65 and older.
Workers in food processing, an estimated 79,000 Michigan residents, will be able to be vaccinated starting March 1.
""Workers in higher risk agricultural settings have been adversely impacted by this pandemic,"" Khaldun said in the release. ""We also know that we need to remove barriers to vaccine access for our most vulnerable individuals in Michigan, including those with disabilities, lower income, and racial and ethnic minorities. These steps will allow our federally qualified health centers across the state to begin vaccinating and will prioritize vaccine allocation to partnerships and providers who are removing barriers to access.""
According to data on Michigan's vaccine website, more than 1.6 million doses have been administered out of more than 2.29 million doses shipped as of Feb. 14.
On Monday, Beaumont Health canceled 1,884 second-dose appointments scheduled for Thursday after learning on Friday of an unexpected reduction in Pfizer vaccine allocations from the state.
The hospital system said it is working to reschedule those appointments one week later on the same day, at the same time, as long as the state supplies enough vaccine by then.
Lynn Sutfin, spokeswoman for MDHHS, said the expansion of eligibility for vaccine was not responsible for Beaumont Health's cancellations, although she declined to comment on what happened to the doses.
""The state has been working with Beaumont Health for the past week to reconcile their second dose shortages,"" Sutfin said in an email to The Detroit News. ""It is unfortunate that they chose to cancel second dose appointments while we were continuing to work with them on this issue.""
About 11.7% of Michigan's population has at least one dose, according to the state.
The virus is blamed for more than 486,000 deaths and 27 million confirmed infections in the U.S.
On Monday, the state reported 111 new outbreaks as of Thursday. Of those outbreaks, 26 are in long-term care facilities such as nursing homes or group homes and 17 are in K-12 schools.
Construction and manufacturing settings have 18 new outbreaks.
The state considers 517,991 people recovered from the virus as of Friday.

432,"
Copper prices fell Tuesday to their lowest level in eight weeks on concerns that China may tamp down on rising commodity prices and that the metal's red-hot rally has gone too far.
Front-month copper futures slid 4.2% to $4.34 a pound, falling 9% below their May record. Tuesday marked the worst day for the industrial metal, which has a variety of uses from electronics to cars and home building, since late April. In London, three-month copper forward contracts on the London Metal Exchange dropped about 4% to $9,553.50 a metric ton.
Speculation that China's strategic stockpiling body, the State Reserve Bureau, is planning to gradually release some of its stockpiles of copper, aluminum and zinc over the coming months led to the downturn on Tuesday, analysts said.
The world's second-largest nation consumes half of the world's refined copper. Investors fear such steps could be part of a broader push from Chinese officials to temper rising prices.
""The biggest headwind is China talking about putting the brakes on inflation and stamping out the hoarding of metals and speculation,"" said William Adams, head of base and battery metals research at Fastmarkets, a price reporting firm. ""That obviously will be a meaningful factor in stamping out some of the more hot money that has flowed into the copper market.""
Copper has led the charge in a broad rally of industrial metals this year. It has drawn attention because of its potential role in a transition away from fossil fuels and because of tight supplies due to lockdown-related mine closures. The metal, which is closely tied to global growth, has also benefited from economies reopening. A rush of speculative bets and bullish predictions from institutional investors have added fuel to the fire.
China has for some weeks been trying to cool the rally in the raw materials on which its economy depends. That has already helped prices reverse course.
Copper prices shed roughly $1,000 a ton in the last month after hitting its highest-ever level of $10,556 a metric ton in May.
Since May, Chinese officials have repeatedly expressed their disquiet about rapidly rising prices.
The national cabinet last month said it would take steps to ensure adequate supply and stable prices for commodities. Industry representatives were warned by regulators to take a zero-tolerance approach to market manipulation or hoarding of metals.
The intervention in commodity markets mirrors Beijing's clampdown on cryptocurrencies. Its efforts on that front have added to volatility in digital currencies such as bitcoin.
Recent rebukes of China by Group of Seven and NATO nations also spurred concerns about worsening geopolitical tensions between Beijing and the West, said Mr. Adams.
This is reminiscent of recent trade disputes that took a toll on global growth and copper demand, he said.
Other London-traded base metals also fell Tuesday. Three-month forward contracts for nickel dropped 4.4% to $17,655 a ton, while aluminum declined 1.2% to $2,460 a ton and zinc fell 1.2% to $2,459 a ton.
Questions about whether copper's record-setting rally was justified could also be emerging, said Julian Kettle, senior vice president at consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. New Covid-19 variants and delays to lockdowns easing in some countries pose a threat to the pace of global economic recovery.
""Prices had gone too far, too fast,"" Mr. Kettle said. ""The fundamentals don't actually justify the price we had seen.""

433,"The Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the U.S. 
Department of Labor warned South Carolina that it woulsd revoke the 
state's workplace safety plan if it refuses to include COVID-19 
protections. Revoking the final approval of the state plan is 
likely to affect the $2.3 million grant funding the state receives 
from the agency.
""The longer South Carolina refuses to adapt emergency temporary 
standard for health care workers, the longer they're needlessly 
putting thousands of workers at risk for the spread of 
coronavirus,"" Jim Frederick, OSHA's acting assistant secretary, 
said in a news conference Tuesday.
""OSHA's main mission is to keep workers safe on the job, and the 
agency will not hesitate to use all of its resources to protect 
workers from known health hazards,"" he said.
Back in June, OSHA issued an Emergency Temporary Standard, which 
included measures such as weekly screening, indoor masking and 
providing paid leave to get vaccinated.
The agency asked states to update their plans to include those 
standards in order to protect essential at-risk workers employed in 
hospitals, nursing homes and other health care settings.
But on July 20, South Carolina OSHA said it would implement a 
COVID-19 standard, as an alternative to the federal standards.
Of the 22 states that operate under OSHA-approved workplace safety 
and health plans that cover workers under the private and public 
sector, including state and local governments, only three states -- 
South Carolina, Utah and Arizona -- have ignored the call to 
include protections in their plans, despite being sent a reminder 
on July 21, Frederick said.
Workplace safety and health care plans undergo two approval stages. 
The first stage gives OSHA the authority to enforce workplace 
standards. The second and final approval stage gives state's the 
bandwidth to oversee regulations. The final approval is what OSHA 
said it will revoke if South Carolina refuses to comply.
Frederick said states were obligated to update their standards to 
ensure there were uniform safety measures across the country. OSHA 
will publish a federal notice and embark on a 35-day comment period 
to discuss the revocation.
""Workers in a hospital setting in South Carolina certainly deserve 
the same protections as workers in Georgia,"" Frederick said.
While this standard was linked to safety precautions in a health 
care setting, Frederick said, OSHA is currently working on a 
potential new Emergency Temporary Standard that will include 
requirements of either vaccination or testing of workers in 
workplaces.
""This is clearly a preemptive strike by the federal government,"" 
said Gov. Henry McMaster. ""With no state regulators in the way, the 
federal Labor Department will be free to penalize employers who do 
not comply with President Biden's unconstitutional vaccine 
mandate.""
McMaster said he has instructed S.C. Department of Labor, Licensing 
and Regulation Director Emily Farr to ""begin immediate preparations 
for a vigorous and lengthy legal fight.
""We are disappointed that Federal OSHA has decided to take this 
step against our very successful State OSHA program,"" Farr said in 
a statement.
Farr emphasized that the state consistently had one of the lowest 
injury and illness rates in the nation with the latest rate of 2.4 
for 2019. ""This is below the national average of 2.8,"" Farr said.
South Carolina reported 613 positive and probable COVID-19 cases 
Tuesday, lower than the thousands of cases the Department of Health 
and Environment Control reported in August and September.
Dr. Brannon Traxler, DHEC's public health director told reporters 
last week that low totals did not mean the pandemic is at an end or 
precautions can be relaxed. Residents. she said, still needed to 
get vaccinated, wear masks and gather outdoors when possible 
throughout the holidays to come to fight the COVID spread.

In Client, the flash business unit experienced growth– specifically in mobile, gaming, automotive, IOT and industrial applications. Western Digital’s strength in this end market was more than offset by pressure in desktop and notebook hard drives due to supply disruptions at our customers and within the company’s own operations.  In Consumer, revenue from both the flash and hard drive business units declined on a sequential basis due to supply disruptions, in addition to uneven geographic demand due to COVID lockdowns.  Business Outlook for Fiscal Second Quarter of 2022       Three Months Ending   December 31, 2021         GAAP(1)       Non-GAAP(1)      Revenue ($B)    $4.70 - $4.90       $4.70 - $4.90      Gross margin    31.0% - 33.0%       32.0% - 34.0%      Operating expenses ($M)    $870 - $890       $760 - $780      Interest and other expense, net ($M)    ~$80       ~$70      Tax rate    N/A       ~11% (2)      Diluted earnings per share    N/A       $1.95 - $2.25      Diluted shares outstanding (in millions)    ~316       ~316     ____________________  (1) Non-GAAP gross margin guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense, totaling approximately $30 million to $50 million. The company’s non-GAAP operating expenses guidance excludes amortization of acquired intangible assets; stock-based compensation expense; and employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, totaling approximately $100 million to $120 million. The company's non-GAAP interest and other expense guidance excludes approximately $10 million of convertible debt activity. In the aggregate, non-GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance excludes these items totaling $140 million to $180 million. The timing and amount of these charges excluded from non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP interest and other expense, net and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share cannot be further allocated or quantified with certainty. Additionally, the timing and amount of additional charges the company excludes from its non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are dependent on the timing and determination of certain actions and cannot be reasonably predicted. Accordingly, full reconciliations of non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP interest and other expense, non-GAAP tax rate and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures (gross margin, operating expenses, interest and other expense, tax rate and diluted earnings per share, respectively) are not available without unreasonable effort.  (2) The non-GAAP tax rate provided is based on a percentage of non-GAAP pre-tax income. Due to differences in the tax treatment of items excluded from our non-GAAP net income and because our tax rate is based on an estimated forecasted annual GAAP tax rate, our estimated non-GAAP tax rate may differ from our GAAP tax rate and from our actual tax rates.

Late in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company announced a decision to reorganize its business by forming two separate product business units: hard disk drives (“HDD”) and flash-based products (“Flash”). To align with the new operating model and business structure, the Company made management organizational changes and implemented new reporting modules and processes to provide discrete information to manage the business.

These Non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from Non-GAAP measures used by other companies. The company believes the presentation of these Non-GAAP measures, when shown in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures, provides useful information to investors for measuring the company’s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods. Specifically, the company believes these Non-GAAP measures provide useful information to both management and investors as they exclude certain expenses, gains and losses that the company believes are not indicative of its core operating results or because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow the company and its peers. As discussed further below, these Non-GAAP measures exclude, as applicable, the amortization of acquired intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense, employee termination, asset impairment and other charges, charges related to a power outage incident and related recovery, convertible debt activity, other adjustments, and income tax adjustments, and the company believes these measures along with the related reconciliations to the GAAP measures provide additional detail and comparability for assessing the company's results. These Non-GAAP measures are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing the company's performance and planning and forecasting future periods. These measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  As described above, the company excludes the following items from its Non-GAAP measures:  Amortization of acquired intangible assets. The company incurs expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets over their economic lives. Such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of the company's acquisitions and any related impairment charges.  Stock-based compensation expense. Because of the variety of equity awards used by companies, the varying methodologies for determining stock-based compensation expense, the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations, and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside the company's control, the company believes excluding stock-based compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of its business over time and compare it against the company's peers, a majority of whom also exclude stock-based compensation expense from their non-GAAP results.  Employee termination, asset impairment and other charges. From time-to-time, in order to realign the company's operations with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the integration of acquisitions, the company may terminate employees and/or restructure its operations. From time-to-time, the company may also incur charges from the impairment of intangible assets and other long-lived assets. In addition, the company may record credits related to gains upon sale of property due to restructuring or reversals of charges recorded in prior periods. These charges or credits are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.  Charges related to a power outage incident and related recovery. In June 2019, an unexpected power outage incident occurred at the flash-based memory manufacturing facilities operated through the company's joint venture with Kioxia Corporation in Yokkaichi, Japan. The power outage incident resulted in costs associated with the repair of damaged tools and the write-off of damaged inventory and unabsorbed manufacturing overhead costs which are expensed as incurred. During fiscal year 2021, the company received recoveries of these losses from its insurance carriers. These charges and recoveries are inconsistent in amount and frequency, and the company believes these charges or recoveries are not part of the ongoing production operation of its business.  Convertible debt activity. The company excludes non-cash economic interest expense associated with its convertible notes. These charges do not reflect the company's operating results, and the company believes they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its business.  Other adjustments. From time-to-time, the company incurs charges or gains that the company believes are not a part of the ongoing operation of its business. The resulting expense or benefit is inconsistent in amount and frequency.  Income tax adjustments. Income tax adjustments include the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual non-GAAP tax rate and a forecasted annual GAAP tax rate as a result of the timing of certain non-GAAP pre-tax adjustments. The income tax adjustments also include adjustments to estimates related to the current status of the rules and regulations governing the transition to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. These adjustments are excluded because the company believes that they are not indicative of the underlying performance of its ongoing business.  Additionally, free cash flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment, and the activity related to Flash Ventures, net. The company considers free cash flow generated in any period to be a useful indicator of cash that is available for strategic opportunities including, among others, investing in the company's business, making strategic acquisitions, repaying debt and strengthening the balance sheet.

442,"(TNSRep) -- The Congressional Research Service issued the following in focus (No. IF11464) updated March 30, 2022, entitled ""U.S. Southern Command"" by international security specialist Kathleen J. McInnis and defense budget analyst Brendan W. McGarry:* * *United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), headquartered in Miami-Dade County, FL, was officially established in 1963. Prior to that, U.S. military elements in the Western hemisphere had been organized under the U.S. Caribbean Defense Command. SOUTHCOM's area of responsibility (AOR) begins at the southern Mexican border and contains the remaining elements of Central and South America, adjacent Atlantic and Pacific waters, and the Caribbean Sea, ultimately encompassing 31 countries and 16 dependencies and areas of special sovereignty. The region represents about one-sixth of the landmass of the world assigned to regional unified commands. SOUTHCOM is led by U.S. Army General Laura Richardson.* * *Figure 1. U.S. Southern Command[View figure here: https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF11464]Source: Congressional Research Service.* * *SOUTHCOM and National Strategic PrioritiesDuring the Cold War, SOUTHCOM undertook a variety of missions intended to prevent the Soviet Union (USSR) from gaining a strategic foothold in the Western hemisphere. After the end of the Cold War, the command changed its focus to containing and/or countering narcotics trafficking and humanitarian assistance missions. Today, SOUTHCOM states that the command seeks to advance national strategic objectives in three primary ways: * Strengthening partnerships with other countries and agencies in the region through activities that enhance access and presence, such as (but not limited to) building their respective security institutions and capacities (including through advancing human rights), integrated officer/enlisted leader development; and humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.* Countering threats by increasing cooperation and information sharing with allies and partners to understand and counter threats from transnational criminal organizations (TCOs), violent extremist organizations, and malign actors.* Building the SOUTHCOM team by prioritizing a workforce that is trained, highly competent, and educated in the history and cultures of the region; is fit and disciplined; and takes into account quality of life issues of the families of SOUTHCOM personnel.The Department of Defense (DOD) is not the lead U.S. government agency for many of the activities that fall under this mission set. As a result, SOUTHCOM has designed its posture to support, rather than lead, other agencies and countries in the region. Security cooperation - a term describing DOD engagements with other countries to improve respective defense capabilities and capacities - involves key programs used by SOUTHCOM to advance U.S. objectives in the region.The Evolving Geopolitical Context of the Southern HemisphereThe Biden Administration's 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance (INSSG) notes that ""our vital national interests compel the deepest connection to the Indo-Pacific, Europe, and the Western Hemisphere."" The document goes on to argue, Because the vital national interests of the United States are inextricably bound to the fortunes of our closest neighbors in the Americas, we will expand our engagement and partnerships throughout theWestern Hemisphere - and especially with Canada and Mexico - based on principles of mutual respect and equality and a commitment to economicprosperity, security, human rights, and dignity.This includes working with the Congress to provide Central America with $4 billion in assistance over four years, and taking other steps to address the root causes of human insecurity and irregular migration, including poverty, criminal violence, andcorruption - problems made exponentially worse by COVID-19 and the deep recession and debt crisis it has wrought throughout Latin America and theCaribbean.Strategic Challenges?SOUTHCOM maintains that the main threats with which it must be prepared to contend include the Peoples Republic of China, Russia, Transnational Criminal Organizations, United States Southern Command (SOUTHCOM)https://crsreports.congress.govcorruption, climate change, and the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. With respect to Russia and China, according to SOUTHCOM, both countries appear to be gaining a greater foothold in the region - particularly in Venezuela - raising the question as to whether SOUTHCOM's AOR is, or will become, a key arena for strategic competition. Other observers, however, contend that Chinese and Russian activities in Latin America do not rise to the level of strategic concern given the extent and depth of U.S. engagement across the region. Regardless, contending with various manifestations of strategic competition has become a mission for the command, in addition to other extant regional priorities.* China's engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean has grown significantly over the past 20 years, particularly in terms of diplomatic and economic ties. This growth reflects China's global ""soft power"" efforts and ""influence operations"" worldwide. According to SOUTHCOM, China also increasingly pays for the security forces of countries within its AOR to attend Spanish- and Portuguese-language military education programs.* Russia has increased its engagement with Latin America over the past decade, although this engagement is relatively limited compared with China's economic activities in the region. Russia has resuscitated relations with former Cold War allies Cuba and Nicaragua, and expanded relations with countries that have had antagonistic relations with the United States, especially Venezuela.* TCOs in the region are known to engage in the trafficking of drugs, weapons, and people, as well as human smuggling, money laundering, and other forms of illegal activity. As described in the INSSG, a priority for the Biden Administration is assistance to Central America that addresses ""the root causes of human insecurity and irregular migration, including poverty, criminal violence, and corruption.""SOUTHCOM SubcomponentsAs with other Combatant Commands, SOUTHCOM is a headquarters; no military units are permanently assigned. SOUTHCOM operates through component commands - one for each of the U.S. armed services, along with a joint special operations component. Each component command may or may not have military forces assigned to it in theater.* U.S. Army South (ARSOUTH) is located at Ft. Sam Houston, TX.* U.S. Naval Forces Southern Command/U.S. Fourth Fleet (COMUSNAVSO/COMFOURTHFLT) is located in Mayport Naval Base in Florida.* Air Forces Southern/Twelfth Air Force (AFSOUTH) is located at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Arizona.* U.S. Marine Forces South (USMARFORSOUTH) is located in Miami-Dade County, FL.* Special Operations Command South (USSOCSOUTH) is located at Homestead Air Reserve Base, Miami-Dade County, FL.Three task forces also report to USSOUTHCOM:* Joint Task Force Bravo (JTF-Bravo), Soto Cano Air Base, Honduras. JTF-Bravo organizes multilateral exercises and supports, with U.S. partner nations, and humanitarian and civic assistance. It also organizes counterdrug, contingency, and disaster relief operations in Central America.* Joint Task Force Guantanamo, U.S. Naval Station Guantanamo Bay (GTMO), Cuba. TF-Guantanamo conducts some detention and interrogation operations in support of U.S. counterterrorism operations, and coordinates and implements detainee screening operations. It also supports law enforcement and war crimes investigations, as well as Military Commissions for Detained Enemy Combatants. JTF-Guantanamo is also prepared to support mass migration operations.* Joint Interagency Task Force South, Key West, Florida. JIATF-South is an interagency task force that organizes and leads interagency counter-drug operations and is responsible for the detection and monitoring of suspect air and maritime drug activity in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern Pacific. JIATF-South also collects, processes, and disseminates counterdrug information for interagency operations.SOUTHCOM FundingDOD budget documentation does not break out total funding by combatant command. Forces and operations assigned to the commands are, in general, funded by the military services. Combatant command funding is, with some exceptions, limited to Operation and Maintenance (O&M) accounts for headquarters and mission support activities. In the case of SOUTHCOM, the U.S. Army is the Combatant Command Support Agent (CCSA) and primarily responsible for funding its headquarters. For FY2022, the Army requested $196.7 million in the O&M sub-activity group for SOUTHCOM, according to DOD budget documents. Congress provided $202.1 million for this activity--$5.4 million (2.7%) more than the request, according to the explanatory statement accompanying the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2022 (Division C of P.L. 117-103).For Additional Reading: CRS In Focus IF10982, China's Engagement with Latin America and the Caribbean; CRS Report R44313, What Is ""Building Partner Capacity?""

444,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, Sept. 5 (TNSRep) -- The Borders, Trade and Immigration Institute issued an 83-page report on June 25, 2021, entitled ""DNA Assays for Determining Honey Origins.""* * *EXECUTIVE SUMMARYAdulteration and mislabeling of honey to mask its true origin have become a global issue.Pollen microscopy, the current gold standard for identifying the geographical origins of honey, is time-consuming and requires expert personnel. Additionally, pollen microscopy cannot source honey samples that have been filtered to remove the original pollen and/or spiked with pollen from more-remunerative plants.In this work we explored the DNA-based characterization of honey origins using deep sequencing targeting the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 (ITS2) spacer DNA between the small- and large-subunit ribosomal RNA genes of plant genomic DNA, known to facilitate species-level discrimination of plants. Using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and clustering analysis, we have assembled country-specific plant DNA sequences obtained from NGS of plant genomic DNA isolated from 300 honey samples. We also have successfully isolated trace DNA and sequenced plant ITS2 from pollen-free, filtered honey using three methods: (i) anti-dsDNA antibodies coupled to magnetic particles; (ii) batch adsorption on Q Sepharose anion exchanger; and (iii) batch adsorption on ceramic hydroxyapatite. The amplified ITS2 region of the captured pollen-free DNA was sequenced using next-generation sequencing and was found to be identical to plant ITS2 of pollen DNA from the same honey sample. Enrichment of trace pollen-free DNA from filtered honey samples opens a new approach to identify the true origins of filtered honey samples, and may suggest other applications of DNA-based product sourcing.* * *TABLE OF CONTENTSLIST OF FIGURES...vLIST OF TABLES...viACRONYMS...vii1.

We have identified (a few) country- and region-specific plant DNA sequences. The COVID-19 pandemic imposed constraints on sample collection and provenance, and this exploratory project involved a relatively small number of samples, but the results are encouraging and suggest that with more work this technique could be relatively effective. We demonstrated efficient testing of claims of honey origin, e.g., for validating Manuka honey for which false claims appear to be quite common. A significant fraction of samples was not effectively processed to meet our high level of stringency with our initial protocols, and we did not have time and lab access enough under the pandemic to resolve this, but we believe the more-robust purification methods we have developed will allow effective analysis of the great majority of honey samples (more samples are currently out for sequencing, using our own resources). We believe the strategies developed for DNA capture and the bioinformatic pipeline can also be applied to identify the origins of difficult and degraded DNA templates for many other forensic applications, as illustrated in Figure 25.DNA sequences obtained from this project will increase the richness of the public DNA database and help link occurrences of source plants across the world. Thus, by blending efforts in DNA purification and sequencing, we have established techniques that will help mitigate fraud associated with honey imports and indirectly aid in providing authentic and safe food for consumers.* * *The full report can be viewed at https://uh.edu/bti/research/honey-dna/bti_honeydna.pdfTARGETED NEWS SERVICE (founded 2004) features non-partisan 'edited journalism' news briefs and information for news organizations, public policy groups and individuals; as well as 'gathered' public policy information, including news releases, reports, speeches.

U.S. President Joe Biden hosts German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for a White House meeting Monday that is likely to be dominated by efforts to deter a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.
The two NATO members have expressed support for bolstering NATO troop positions in the eastern part of the alliance, with the United States ordering extra forces to Poland and Romania and Scholz saying Sunday he was open to strengthening a German-led battlegroup in Lithuania.
The United States has also been delivering military aid to Ukraine, including ammunition and anti-tank missiles. To the frustration of some NATO allies, Germany has declined to extend its support to include lethal weapons, with the government citing a policy of not sending such arms into conflict zones.
Another potential point of contention is Germany's reliance on Russian energy supplies and the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that is designed to bring Russian natural gas to Germany.
The United States, among others, has viewed the pipeline as part of the deterrence of a Russian attack on Ukraine, saying an invasion would mean the end of the project.
Scholz told German broadcaster ARD ahead of his trip to Washington that in terms of the pipeline, ""We have considered all measures and there is nothing that is ruled out.""
In addition to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the White House said Biden and Scholz would discuss several other issues, including climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.

453,"Steve Addazio’s time as Colorado State football coach is done after 16 games. The 62-year-old veteran coach is expected to be let go by the school Thursday, less than a week after the Rams ended the 2021 season. Multiple sources told the Coloradoan that the team had a meeting scheduled with athletic director Joe Parker at 1 p.m. EST, and those sources confirm the staff was pulled off the road recruiting. Football Scoop and ESPN are also reporting he will be fired. It was the first full season for Addazio leading the Rams after a shortened 2020 due to COVID-19. CSU went 3-9 in 2021 (2-6 in Mountain West play) and 4-12 overall under Addazio. He made $1.55 million in 2021, with his salary set to rise to $1.6 million for 2022. He was the second-highest paid coach in the Mountain West (behind Wyoming’s Craig Bohl) in 2021. Addazio’s buyout was $5 million until Thursday, when it dropped to $3 million. SPORTS TO YOUR INBOX: Sign up for the USA TODAY Sports newsletter WOLKEN: Four reasons why college football coaches salaries have gone crazy BOWL PROJECTIONS: Michigan, Oklahoma State join College Football Playoff field CSU athletic director Joe Parker hired Addazio in December 2019, less than two weeks after he was fired after his seventh season leading Boston College. His career record is now 61-67 in 11 seasons as a head coach at Temple, Boston College and CSU. He’s 32-51 all-time in conference play. Parker, along with CSU president Joyce McConnell, relied heavily on the input of Urban Meyer (a former CSU assistant) in the search. Addazio was formerly an assistant under Meyer. The school first reached an agreement with Butch Jones before backing out late in the process due to Title IX concerns from his time at Tennessee. It was a tumultuous two years for Addazio at CSU. The COVID-19 pandemic hit shortly after his hire, and football operations shut down in the middle of his first spring practice early in 2020. Complaints from members of the football program regarding violations of COVID-19 protocols and racial insensitivity prompted an investigation into the football program and athletic department later in 2020. The 2020 football season was initially postponed by the Mountain West due to the spread of COVID-19 before the league ultimately opted for a shortened eight-game season. The Rams ended up playing only four games. Three were cancelled due to COVID-19 issues with teams (two due to the opponent and one due to CSU), and the last game was forfeited by Utah State due to a player boycott. The Rams went 1-3 in the shortened season. CSU opened 2021 with home losses to South Dakota State and Vanderbilt before righting the ship with wins in three of four games, with a close loss at top-10 Iowa in the middle. The season turned in mid-October, when CSU had a chance to take a lead in the Mountain Division with a win at Utah State. Instead, CSU lost on a chaotic final sequence when the field goal team was unnecessarily rushed on the field and missed a go-ahead kick. Addazio placed the blame on players after the game. The next week, Addazio banned media from two days of practice availability as criticism around the Utah State finish swirled. The downward spiral had started. CSU ended up losing its final six games of the season, giving up more points each game than the week before. It culminated with a 52-10 loss to Nevada at home Nov. 27, when Addazio was ejected in the second quarter. He was just the second FBS head coach in the last five years to be ejected from a game. The 36,500-seat Canvas Stadium was virtually empty by the end of that game, and social media was aflame with anger from CSU fans. Addazio replaced Mike Bobo, who went 28-35 in five seasons with the Rams before he was let go after the 2019 season.

457,"EAGLE PASS — U.S. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy led a 10-member GOP congressional delegation to the Texas-Mexico border Monday, and they unleashed a withering attack on the Biden administration's immigration policies. McCarthy, who was joined by U.S. Reps. Tony Gonzales of San Antonio, Chip Roy of Austin and Randy Weber of Friendswood, focused much of the fire on President Joe Biden's decision to lift a Trump-era policy called Title 42, which was designed to limit the spread of COVID-19 and allows federal authorities to immediately expel migrants crossing the border without authorization. ""If President Biden wants to lift Title 42, he should come down here,"" McCarthy said beneath the international bridge in Eagle Pass, just steps away from the Rio Grande. ""Before he makes this decision, he should look at the border agents in the eye and ask them what's the best decision to make."" The trip to the border, announced over the weekend, came the same day the body of Texas National Guard Spc. Bishop Evans, 22, of Arlington was recovered in the Rio Grande about 2 miles upstream from where the delegation spoke. Evans, part of Gov. Greg Abbott's Operation Lone Star border initiative, had disappeared three days earlier after he jumped into a fast-moving section of the river in an effort to save a pair of migrants in distress. The migrants survived, and authorities said they are suspected of drug trafficking. ""It's a gloomy day here in Eagle Pass,"" Gonzales, whose district includes Eagle Pass and a large portion of the upper Rio Grande, said in reference to Evans' death. ""It just feels like a sad day."" Title 42, which is set to expire May 23, has become something of a partisan flashpoint ever since the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention earlier this month unveiled plans to end it.  McCarthy and others said they have legislation ready that would keep the policy in place. But since Democrats control both houses of Congress, they have almost no ability to push the measure forward. Some Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar of Laredo, have said Biden should overrule the CDC on the matter. Meanwhile, two lawsuits seek to prevent the federal government from ending Title 42, including one filed Friday by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.  According to the latest figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection, agents have documented more than 1.2 million ""encounters"" with unauthorized immigrants on the southern border in the six-month period that ended March 31. Nearly 160,000 encounters occurred in March alone, a 37% jump from February, the federal agency said. McCarthy called the pace ""unsustainable."" ""A country without a secure border is no longer a country,"" McCarthy said. Although he and the others said the administration is unprepared for what is expected to be a major increase in unauthorized crossings once Title 42 is lifted, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week that plans are in place to manage any surge. “That includes moving officers, agents, DHS volunteer force personnel to rapidly decompress points along the border and more efficiently process migrants,” Psaki said at a White House news briefing. Eagle Pass, which in the 2020 census recorded a population of 28,130, is at a remote section of the border between Laredo and Del Rio. About a quarter-mile from where the congressional delegation spoke, Juan Zendejas was selling used household supplies, clothing and children's toys in an outdoor flea market on the southwest rim of Eagle Pass. Asked about the increase in border crossings, Zendejas shrugged. ""They come for a better life,"" he said. ""But they should come legally, not illegally."" McCarthy's visit followed last week's revelation in a forthcoming book and news accounts that he had planned to ask then-President Donald Trump to resign in the wake of the attack on the U.S. Capitol as Congress was preparing to certify Biden's election victory even while Trump sought to cling to power.  Asked about the revelation, and the assertion that he had misled reporters about his plans before an audio recording of him confirmed the reports, McCarthy sought to put a fine point on the controversy. The question put to him by reporters was whether he urged Trump to resign. He said he had not because he and the then-president never directly discussed it. He did acknowledge telling U.S. Rep. Liz Cheny, R-Wyoming, that he had planned to urge Trump to step aside in the remaining days of his presidency. McCarthy did make clear in the news conference that he and other Republicans are working feverishly to wrest control of the House from the Democrats in November's midterm elections. McCarthy would be a leading contender for speaker if the GOP wins control of the House. The border and Biden's approach to it, he added, will be a key component of that campaign. ""We will hold this administration accountable,"" he said. John C. Moritz covers Texas government and politics for the USA Today Network in Austin.

459,"Travis County inched closer to its goal of reaching down below the threshold to possibly enter Stage 4 of Austin Public Health's risk-based guidelines.
On Friday, public health leaders continued to press residents to get vaccinated against the coronavirus as hospital resources remained strained.
Only 34 new daily coronavirus admissions to the hospital were reported Friday, which lowered the rolling seven-day hospitalization average to 52. Austin Public Health uses the average to help determine how the most medically vulnerable can protect themselves against the coronavirus. The new average was the lowest since July 31, when the average was 54.
Austin Public Health is currently in Stage 5 of the agency's risk-based guidelines, which is the most critical stage and is triggered when the rolling weekly average of new daily hospital admissions reaches 50 or above. The guidelines range from Stage 1 to Stage 5, with five being the highest threat level for community spread of the coronavirus.
As it has throughout much of the pandemic, the 78660 ZIP code that includes much of Pflugerville has the most number of cases in Travis County at 11,153.
The county's highest average for new daily hospital admissions during the pandemic was 94 on Jan. 9. The average needs to get below 50 for Austin Public Health to consider the community in less danger of community spread.
Austin Public Health at the start of the pandemic determined that Austin and Travis County had enough hospital staff for 200 intensive care unit beds for COVID-19 patients, but Dr. Desmar Walkes, Austin-Travis County health authority, said Friday that ICUs were above capacity, and she implored the community to help stop the numbers from climbing again.
""Our ICUs are overcapacity,"" Walkes said. ""We have ICU nurses stretched thin. We have people in unconventional places in the hospital receiving ICU care. We have patients in the ERs waiting on stretchers in the hallway. And, we can do something to help that congestion.
""We're seeing young people succumb to this disease, and that's something we have to stop,"" Walkes continued. ""We're seeing pregnant women (with COVID-19) having babies and men being on life support and that has to stop. We have to get people vaccinated. It's time, Austin.""
Travis County coronavirus data continued to show little change in hospital numbers for COVID-19.
Austin Public Health was tracking 515 people in the hospital with COVID-19, which was a major improvement over the pandemic record high of 653 patients set Aug. 25.
As many as 220 people were in Austin-area intensive care units for COVID-19. That number hit a pandemic record high of 237 on Aug. 22. The 158 patients on ventilators remained an improvement over the pandemic record high of 174 set on Aug. 29.
Walkes said that, at the start of the week, 20 patients were waiting to be transferred into Austin and Travis County for medical care. Of those, five of the patients had illnesses linked to the coronavirus, and the rest were people that needed help with such things as strokes and heart attacks.
""Whether you are pro-life or pro-living, getting vaccinated protects people's lives,"" Walkes continued, adding that hospital staff are now having to pick and choose who gets care first.
""The delta variant of COVID-19 causes severe illness. Those who are unvaccinated are 10 times more likely to end up in the hospital if they get COVID-19. And, they have 10 times more risk of having an undesirable outcome and even dying from this disease.""
Interim Austin Public Health Director Adrienne Sturrup on Friday added that it is every Travis County resident's responsibility to get vaccinated and wear masks in public to protect those at risk.
""We need the community to do their part,"" Sturrup said. ""And, so again, as we do every week, I implore you to look beyond what is good for you and think about the broader community. Wear your mask. Stay home when you're sick. Get vaccinated.""",County inches closer to Stage 4 threshold
462,"With the slogan ""Eat Simply So Others Can Simply Eat,"" the  eighth annual Palm Beach Empty Bowls event returns Friday with a mission to raise funds for the Palm Beach County Food Bank and help those who are struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Because of the pandemic, attendees will not be able to enjoy the soups on site at The Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea as they have in past years. Instead, the event  will have a drive-thru pick-up option from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. at the church and a delivery option for  orders of four or more. Delivery range is limited to the town and downtown West Palm Beach.
Last year, 550 attendees raised $83,000, with all proceeds going to the ood bank.
""We know that food insecurity has increased exponentially during the pandemic in our own backyard here in Palm Beach County as well as nationwide and globally,"" said the Rev. Burl Salmon, associate for Christian education, pastoral care and outreach at Bethesda. ""We know that when you don't have food, everything else becomes even harder. If there's one thing we can do to alleviate hunger, like increasing the resources of the Palm Beach (County) Food Bank, we absolutely will.""
The goal this year is to raise $100,000, he said.
Salmon said other changes this year are: the soups will be handed out cold in microwaveable containers; and the traditional handcrafted bowls will be available only to those who place large orders, while supplies last.
Empty Bowls in a grassroots movement that raises money for charitable organizations fighting hunger within their community. Bethesda's event takes place during Feeding in February, a church program to address food insecurity.
Food Bank CEO Jamie Kendall said the event raises awareness about the often dire situation of many Palm Beach County residents.
""About one in six people living in Palm Beach County don't know where their next meal is coming from. We have tripled our distribution of food within the past year to help those facing job loss, or schools being closed,"" Kendall said. ""Our services are needed now more than ever.""
She added that the pandemic has made people realize the importance of hunger relief organizations and that many people are ""just a paycheck or disaster away from having to choose between fixing a tire on their car or putting food on the table.""
The soups are provided by  restaurants in town including Buccan, BrickTop's, The Breakers, The Colony, Eau Palm Beach, Trevini Ristorante and Field of Greens.
There will also be 15 soups to choose from, including Manhattan clam chowder and lumberjack chili. The soups will be served with rustic bread from Old School Bakery.
The Palm Beach Food Bank is processing an average of 1.5 million pounds of food per month since the start of the pandemic, according to a press release from the organization.
The Food Bank obtains food from grocery stores, restaurants and food distributors to provide to approximately 200 community partners, which include soup kitchens and residential housing programs.
Ticket prices are $25 if bought online ahead of the event, or $30 at the door. For details, visit www.bbtsvirtual.org/feeding-in-february.

463,"Sep. 28 - No one in Avista Stadium is yelling louder than Joni Koontz.
She has a guttural yell, a plug-your-ears-if-you're-standing-next-to-her kind of holler. There's a sense of urgency to it.
""C'MON JAAAACK!"" she screams at Spokane Indians batter Jack Blomgren, the second baseman.
The score is 0-0 in the bottom of the fifth inning. This is Game 2 of the High-A West championship series between the Indians and the Eugene Emeralds. It's Wednesday night, and the Indians are down 0-1 in the series.
Koontz stands on the third base side of the walkway that divides the upper and lower tiers of seats in the stands. She has glasses, gray hair under her red Indians cap and a red Indians shirt. Indians earrings, with pictures of mascot Doris the Spokanasaurus on them, dangle from her ears. At first glance she looks like a team employee, and she says people often mistake her for one.
""Just a fan,"" she says.
She's a fan who typically comes to 10 or so games a year. In 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of minor league baseball, Koontz was left without a team to cheer for.
""It was boring,"" she says.
Losing baseball was emotionally devastating for fans, players and team employees alike. For lovers of America's pastime, a summer without baseball isn't much of a summer at all. Many say they felt empty without going to the ballpark.
The return of Indians baseball in 2021 would have been welcome regardless of COVID-19 impacts.
Still, the unprecedented season has been difficult. On top of COVID-19 limitations, wildfire smoke, extreme heat and drought all caused problems. Fireworks nights were canceled. Attendance never bounced back to 2019 levels.
And yet, despite the negatives, many say this unique year has been one of the greatest in Indians' history.
The team moved up the minor-league ranks from Low A to High A, which expanded the season from 76 to roughly 120 games. After 18 years as a Texas Rangers affiliate, the team joined the Colorado Rockies organization. Most memorably, the Indians ended the season on a historic hot streak, going 30-9 after Aug. 1 and rocketing up the standings to snag a playoff berth.
Given all that's happened in the last two years, many say it's only fitting for the season to end with a battle for the High-A West championship.
""They deserve a championship, they really do,"" Koontz says. ""These guys played their hearts out.""
Batting practice
At 3 p.m. the Indians warm up in right field, a cluster of men in red shirts and blue shorts. They swing their arms, touch their toes and jog casually back and forth. It's 70-something degrees with blue skies and white clouds, a perfect day for baseball.
Except for music coming out of the stadium loudspeakers, the field's quiet until the team starts playing catch and the satisfying pop of baseballs smacking into gloves carries through the air.
From the mid-1980s until 2020, Indians Manager Scott Little heard that sound nearly every day, all summer long.
Little is stocky and gruff, a man of few words. Dark sunglasses cover his eyes, and even when he's talking he rarely looks away from his players as they get loose.
In 1984, the New York Mets drafted an 18-year-old Little in the 7th round. He worked his way up to the major leagues with the Pittsburgh Pirates, earning four at bats in 1989 and going 1-for-4. He never played in the majors again and became a coach in 1992.
Because he's spent his whole adult life in professional baseball, 2020 was the first time Little spent a whole year at home.
""It was odd,"" he says.
After a season away, nobody cared about COVID-related inconveniences, Little says. Players and coaches were ""willing to do anything we needed to do"" to play.
From May through July, the Indians didn't play like a championship contender. At the start of August they had a losing record and sat a daunting 14.5 games back in the standings.
No sane gambler would put much money on a team overcoming a 14.5-game deficit. The 2021 team would be remembered as the pandemic year squad, but it didn't seem destined to win a spot in anyone's heart.
Inside the clubhouse, the attitude was different. It sounds crazy, Little says, but even going into August the team thought it could make the playoffs. The players had a ""never say die,"" mentality, he says.
""We played old time baseball,"" he says. ""We ran, we bunted, we got runs in.""
After warming up, the Indians prepare for batting practice. They roll out the L-screen, lay protective mesh on the grass in front of home plate and carry a bucket of balls to the mound.
Indians second and third baseman Aaron Schunk, a 24-year-old Georgian, says he feels grateful he got to play baseball this year.
Not being able to high-five fans and being told not to socialize with teammates  -  to limit COVID-19 transmission  -  was unpleasant, Schunk says, but those were relatively small issues.
Schunk was fired up when opening day 2021 arrived.
""The one word would be joy, I think,"" he says. ""And that goes for everybody.""
A second-round pick in 2019, Schunk has struggled this year. His .223 batting average is far below the impressive .306 mark he managed with the Boise Hawks in his first pro season two years ago.
But he grins when talking about making it to the playoffs. Playoff baseball's always fun, he says.
Shelby Lackey, a tall, lanky relief pitcher with a tuft of red beard on his chin and a mid-90s fastball, says he hasn't been a part of a late-season winning streak like the Indians had.
""Coming to the ballpark every day we knew we were going to win,"" he says.
Lackey spits on the ground, then kicks some dirt on top of the loogie.
""It was probably the most special thing I've been a part of playing baseball,"" he says.
The press box
Up in the press box, behind home plate, Indians radio broadcaster Mike Boyle has one of the best seats in the house. He's got a bird's-eye view of the field and the pine-covered hills in the distance.
For thousands of Spokanites, listening to Boyle's deep, clear voice over the radio has been a summer constant for a decade. It was strange not to hear him last year.
Being off the air felt strange to Boyle, too. He grimaces when he thinks about the lost season.
""It really was hard mentally,"" he says. ""It was a challenge to just keep yourself up and positive.""
When the baseball season began, Boyle felt mixed emotions. He was ecstatic to return to the booth, but with attendance capped at 25% of capacity, the energy on opening day was disappointingly low.
""It was thrilling and different all at the same time,"" he says, adding that the whole season has felt off due to smaller crowds even though more fans came out as the summer dragged on.
Few people have followed the Indians closer than Boyle since he took over full play-by-play duties in 2011. The man who's watched thousands of baseball games says this team's torrid run at the end of the year was incredible.
""We didn't hit .500 until August,"" he emphasizes, getting excited as he describes the turnaround. ""To actually watch it unfold was one of the most remarkable things I've ever witnessed, and I've seen a lot of baseball.""
This has been one of the best seasons Boyle's ever watched.
""It's been one of the most fun,"" he says, checking his audio levels before the pregame show starts at 6 p.m. ""For the first year back, I don't think you could draw up the script any better.""
The grounds crew
When the Emeralds finish batting practice at about 5 p.m., the grounds crew gets to work.
One man drives small circles around the infield dirt in what looks like a stubby lawnmower, towing a rake to smooth out any imperfections. One checks the pitcher's mound to make sure it's ready. Another lays down fresh, white chalk to mark the base lines and batter's boxes.
Jeremy Headley, the Indians' 20-year-old, mustachioed head groundskeeper, has been keeping Avista Stadium's field in tip-top shape for two years now. Last year, with the season canceled, he worked at Costco and Granite Point Resort. He says he's glad to be back working on the field.
Headley's humble about the spiffy designs he mows on the grass. For instance, those perfectly mown circles around the pitcher's mound? That's easier to do than you'd think, he says, because once you trace the first ring you have a line to follow.
Despite his modesty, Headley's proud of the grounds crew's work. He mentions, matter of factly, that Avista Stadium has won the Northwest League of Professional Baseball's Field of the Year award a bunch of times in a row.
Like everyone else, Headley says it was cool to watch the Indians make up 14.5 games in the standings and grab a playoff berth. But one of his 2021 reflections stands out.
When the Indians moved up to High A, the pitchers got better, he says. They throw harder and have better breaking pitches. The result?
""A lot more foul balls.""
The fans
The game's still scoreless in the bottom of the seventh. A nearly full moon hangs over the left field fence and the Indians have runners on first and second with one out.
Tonight's a school night and the stands aren't close to full  -  1,741 fans are here and Avista holds 7,000  -  but the crowd's the loudest it's been, sensing a rally.
""Double steal, noodle arm's catching,"" a fan shouts.
Two of the Indians' most loyal fans, seniors Pat and Sanford Foster, are watching the drama unfold from their seats behind home plate.
Before this season, the Fosters didn't consider themselves baseball fans. They'd been to Indians games a mere handful of times. This year, they've been at all but two home games.
The Fosters say they don't have a good explanation for why they suddenly love baseball so much.
""I just went to the ticket office and kind of got carried away,"" Sanford Foster says seriously, adding he and his wife have gotten hooked and plan on coming to just as many games next year.
The crowd boos in unison when the home plate umpire calls a strike against Indians' batter Daniel Montano, putting the left-fielder down in the count 1-2.
Fans sit on the edge of their seats to watch the most important pitch of the game so far, trying to will Montano to knock in a run.
A loud groan fills the stadium when the lefty strikes out swinging. Daniel Cope, the catcher, hits a weak pop up to second base a few pitches later, stranding the runners on first and second. Some fans take that as their cue and head to the exits.
Steve and Lisa Tompkins, sitting behind the Indians' dugout on the first base side, aren't going anywhere.
The Tompkins have been season ticket holders for 14 years. Not going to Indians games in 2020 was tough, they say.
""This is our summertime family,"" Lisa Tompkins says.
Steve Tompkins has watched Indians games since he was a kid. He remembers when Ron Cey, who would later become a Los Angeles Dodgers legend, played for the team in 1971.
The Cey team isn't one of Tompkins' two favorites though. His top two of all-time are the 2018 team and this one.
It's the top of the ninth now, two down, and the Emeralds have men on first and second. A ground ball off the bat of an Emeralds' hitter sneaks through the infield for a single, putting Eugene on top 1-0.
""Dang it,"" Steve Tompkins says angrily.
The crowd grows quiet, then quieter  still when the next Emeralds' batter hits a double that knocks in two more runs, putting the Indians down 0-3.
""Oh come on,"" Steve Tompkins says.
The double sparks a mass exodus from the stands. Vickie ""Grandma Vickie"" Mularski, an Indians section manager who's been helping fans find their seats for 12 years, walks upstream against the flow of people heading home.
She leans over the railing when she reaches her friends, the Tompkins.
""I have to say, it's over,"" she says, dejected.
Then she corrects herself.
""It ain't over till the fat lady sings.""
(Two days later, the Indians went on to lose the series in four games.)
The front office
Uncertainty has dominated the last two years for Spokane Indians Senior Vice President Otto Klein.
Until June 2020, teams didn't know for sure that the minor league season would be canceled. Plus, Major League Baseball announced a dramatic minor league restructuring in 2020 and the Indians front office didn't know where the team would end up in the shuffle.
Even after the team learned it'd be moving to the High-A West and joining the Colorado Rockies, 2021 was a roller coaster.
At the start of the season, Gov. Jay Inslee's COVID-19 mandates forced the team to limit attendance to 25% capacity. Capacity and mask requirements ended up shifting throughout the year, but in June the team was hopeful that the worst effects of the pandemic were over.
""Fourth of July we thought we were out of the woods,"" Klein says.
Then in August, COVID-19 case counts and hospitalizations began to rise again. Klein says he expects some fans were nervous about the delta variant and chose to stay home. Wildfire smoke and record-breaking heat throughout the summer probably depressed attendance too, he says.
The last two home games of the year were canceled due to ""COVID-19 concerns"" among  the visiting Tri-City Dust Devils. Klein says losing those games was heartbreaking.
""Those would have been the two biggest crowds of the year,"" he says.
Financially, 2021 will be a year to forget, Klein says, but he's also incredibly proud of how staff have handled the last two years.
""Businesswise we're down, but accomplishments wise ..."" he says. ""I think it's been one of the greatest seasons in Spokane Indians history.""
Paid to watch baseball
Superfan Joni Koontz hears someone in the stands behind her heckle the Indians' batter and shakes her head.
The chirping is coming from a group of Emeralds' front office staff who traveled from Eugene to watch the championship games, she says. This entire series will be played in Spokane, instead of alternating between the two cities, because the Emeralds are field-less at the moment. The University of Oregon Ducks baseball team kicked them out to make way for college fall ball.
""They don't even have a field and their front office is calling us cupcakes,"" Koontz says in disgust. ""It's not right that you do that to the other team.""
Alex Gustafson, the section manager for this part of the stands, confirms the boisterous group is the Emeralds' front office staff.
Gustafson, who has a black beard under his mask, started working for the Indians six years ago when he was a senior in college. He wants to work in a baseball front office someday. Until then, he's happy being a section manager, a job he describes as ""a cross between a security guard and a cheerleader.""
""Even on the worst day you get paid to watch baseball,"" he explains.
Multiple section leaders say the lack of baseball in 2020 hurt, but Gustafson took the loss harder than most. He says he felt depressed and empty not coming to the ballpark. Being at the stadium again means a lot to him.
""It didn't matter if we sold 70 tickets or 70,000,"" he says. ""Baseball was ba

465,"By David Marino Jr.
Bangor Daily News Staff
GUILFORD -- The Guilford company that is the largest COVID-19 testing swab manufacturer in the U.S. will receive up to nearly $150 million from the Department of Defense to open up a new production facility in Tennessee, the defense department said this week.
Puritan Medical Products will receive up to $147 million to renovate a facility in Orlinda, Tennessee, and prepare the space to produce millions of foam swabs used to test for the coronavirus by February 2022.
In addition to its original production facility in Guilford, Puritan has two manufacturing plants in Pittsfield, one that produces foam swabs and another that makes flocked swabs. The Tennessee plant will be the company's fourth and will be partially open by the end of the year, Puritan Executive Vice President Tim Templet said.
Templet said the company had chosen to locate its new plant in Tennessee because it was the ""right choice"" after some investigation by company officials. He did not elaborate on what drove the decision, and he would not say what type of building the facility will occupy.
Asked about further expansion for Puritan, Templet said there were no plans that he knew of at the moment.
A Puritan spokesperson had confirmed the new plant, the company's first outside of Maine, earlier this month but would not reveal when it would open or its location in Tennessee.
Orlinda is a small city of fewer than 900 residents in Robertson County, Tennessee. It's located about 45 minutes north of Nashville and just south of the Kentucky border.
Puritan, a family-owned medical supplier that produces a number of different swab types, has seen its business grow exponentially over the past year because it is one of only two companies in the world that produces the nasopharyngeal swabs used in COVID-19 tests. The only other company that makes them is Copan Diagnostics in northern Italy.
The company has received tens of millions of dollars from the federal government throughout the pandemic to expand swab production. It opened its two Pittsfield plants within the past year, using a $75.5 million Department of Defense grant awarded in April 2020 and a $51.2 million grant awarded last August.
In January, it received $110 million to purchase additional production equipment. Last June, then-President Donald Trump even visited the company's Guilford headquarters during an official presidential visit. It was Trump's first trip to Maine since the start of his term in 2017.
A call to Orlinda's city hall was not answered late Wednesday.

466,"May 29 - Six Cobb County parents who sued the school district over mask requirements for students in classrooms are dropping their lawsuit, according to their attorneys.
The decision comes after Gov. Brian Kemp's decision to sign an executive order to restrict public schools from imposing mask mandates.
""He understands the physical and psychological danger that these kids were in having to wear a mask eight hours a day,"" Mitch Skandalakis, an attorney for the families, said of Kemp. He said the parents' case will not go forward ""as we have won.""
A Cobb County School District spokeswoman previously told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that it was confident that ""the facts and law will speak for themselves."" On Friday, the spokeswoman said the district wanted the facts to be argued in court, ""not social or traditional media.""
In early May, the school district said it no longer required masks for vaccinated students and staff. Superintendent Chris Ragsdale also said in a recent statement that said he expects mask will be optional when the new school year begins Aug. 2.
The parents in April filed a request for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction against the district's mask requirement for students and its contract tracing policy for confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The parents' complaint alleged that mask mandates don't stop the transmission of the virus that causes COVID-19 and the district's contact tracing policy violates student privacy under the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.
U.S. District Court Judge Thomas W. Thrash Jr. earlier this month rejected the plaintiffs' request. Attorney Robert Madayag, who also represented the parents, said they offered information from studies showing prolonged mask use was harmful.
""Our clients did their homework and were prepared to take on the public angst and ire because they cared about their children,"" he said.
The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention continues to recommend schools stick with their current COVID-19 mitigation strategies. Its most recent guidance to schools state masks should be work at all times by everyone in school buildings, with exceptions set aside for eating and drinking.
",Cobb parents drop lawsuit against district over student mask mandate
468,"Workers at businesses with more than 100 employees must be vaccinated for COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing starting Jan. 4, under a new federal rule released Thursday.
The new details immediately prompted an outcry from Republican leaders in Iowa who oppose COVID-19 vaccine mandates, and Gov. Kim Reynolds vowed to sue over the requirement.
Once in effect, the new rule could cover more than 923,000 Iowa employees who work for 2,200 businesses.
In Iowa, employers must now navigate the new regulations, as well as a brand-new state law that the Iowa Legislature passed last week in anticipation of the federal rule. The law attempted to soften some of the effects of the rule by requiring employers to accept religious and medical exemptions for the COVID-19 vaccine while also extending unemployment benefits to those fired for not complying with vaccine mandates.
Here's what you need to know about the new rule, Iowa's new law, and what happens next.
Who does the new rule apply to?
The new federal rule will apply to workers at businesses with 100 or more employees. Employers could be slapped with penalties of up to $13,600 per violation if they don't comply.
The rule doesn't apply to people who work from home, but it would require testing for unvaccinated hybrid workers if they're reporting to the office during a given week.
In Iowa, the rule also appears to apply to state and local government employers with 100 or more employees, including teachers and school staff. That's because Iowa is among 21 states that have the option of writing their own workplace rules for public and private sector workers. But those rules can't be weaker than what the federal government is requiring – and must be adopted in 30 days.
A spokesperson for Reynolds did not comment Thursday on whether the state plans to follow the requirements for state employees.
Workers are considered fully vaccinated if they have taken two doses of either the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, or one dose of the Johnson & Johnson, by Jan. 4. Employers must give employees paid time off to get vaccinated and recover from side effects.
What if I don't want to get vaccinated?
Currently, 68% of Iowans 18 and older are fully vaccinated for COVID-19, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. But there has been significant resistance among the remaining Iowans who are unvaccinated. A September Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll found one in four Iowa adults does not plan to take the vaccine.
The rule allows workers to undergo weekly testing as an alternative, although they may have to bear the cost of the testing themselves.
The rule would also require unvaccinated employees wear a face mask on the job beginning Dec. 5.
Businesses can be tougher than the rules require and can mandate workers get vaccinated, rather than giving them the option of regular testing.
Can I get a religious exemption for the COVID-19 vaccine? What about a medical exemption?
Simply put: Yes and yes.
But the details of how the federal exemption process will interact with a new Iowa law that involves religious exemptions remain somewhat murky.
Religious and medical exemptions for employee vaccination requirements have already been allowed under federal law. Federal guidance says employers must make ""reasonable accommodations"" for employees who refuse the vaccination due to disability, religious belief or pregnancy. Those accommodations could include a testing alternative under the new rule.
In anticipation of the new federal rule, Reynolds signed a new law last week that attempts to grant Iowans wider latitude to claim medical and religious exemptions from employer COVID-19 vaccination mandates. It appears to go further than federal law by giving employers less of an option to turn down an employee's claim for an exemption if there's not a reasonable accommodation available — or if they suspect it's not a legitimate medical reason or religious belief.
The law says employers ""shall"" waive a vaccine requirement for an employee who submits a statement that receiving the vaccine would be ""injurious"" to their health or well-being, or that it conflicts ""with the tenets and practices"" of a religion the employee adheres to or belongs to. The statement would not need to be attested by a physician or a faith leader.
Public health experts say the shots are safe and very effective at preventing severe illness from COVID-19.
The new law also specifies that employees must request a waiver and submit a statement but does not specify a specific form employees must use. Iowans seeking an exemption can check with their employer about how to make the request.
How does Iowa's new law interact with the federal mandate?
The new law has already affected some hospitals that put their own vaccine mandates in place. MercyOne delayed its Nov. 1 deadline until Nov. 12 as hospital leaders work through the new law's implications. UnityPoint planned to place employees who hadn't complied by Nov. 1 on leave while leaders sort out who qualifies for exemptions.
State leaders said Thursday they were still examining the rule and did not offer clarification on how Iowa's new state law could affect enforcement of the federal rule when it comes to who qualifies for an exemption. Several Iowa businesses also said they were still looking through the new rule.
Whether Iowa's expanded exemptions will allow more employees to circumvent Biden's vaccine requirements remains unclear, said Denise Hill, an associate professor at Drake University who has written a book on vaccine mandates and also practices as an attorney and mediator with the Whitfield & Eddy law firm.
""I think that this is sort of a novel approach that Iowa has taken, and if it's found to be successful, I definitely can  see other states that have similar objectives following suit,"" Hill said.
Senate Minority Leader Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, said Thursday there is still confusion on how Iowa's new law will intersect with the federal requirements, and it may require legal action to sort through.
""I do think that there's substantial concern on how those two laws are going to intersect — on the exemption piece in particular — and so I think that's, unfortunately, a question that will likely have to be answered by the courts because I don't know if there's a lot more that the state legislative branch can do,"" he said.
In addition to expanding exemptions, Iowa's new law also allows Iowans fired for not complying with vaccine mandates to qualify for unemployment benefits.
Though the law gained support from most Republicans and several Democrats, it faced pushback from businesses, who said the new law could place employers in a difficult position, as well as from groups that oppose vaccine mandates, who didn't believe the law went far enough to ban mandates.
Where can I get vaccinated?
The Iowa Department of Public Health has a search tool to assist Iowans with finding a vaccine provider in their area.
That is available at vaccinate.iowa.gov/providers.
Where can I find coronavirus tests?
COVID-19 tests are now widely available from a variety of sources and in a variety of forms. The statewide Test Iowa program offers free, take-home test kits where Iowans collect their own saliva and mail it to the state lab at the University of Iowa for analysis.
The state health department recently added drop-off sites in large cities around the state where Iowans can submit their tests for same-day delivery to the state lab.
Iowa's coronavirus testing system includes several options ranging from local clinics and pharmacies — like Hy-Vee, Walgreens and CVS — to private firms like GS Labs in West Des Moines, which charges $380 per test out of pocket to those who don't have insurance.
Providers offer different types of tests, including PCR tests, rapid antigen tests and antibody tests.
The state last month launched a testing locator map to help connect Iowans with tests in their area. The map is available on the state's coronavirus website.
What are state leaders saying?
Iowa Republican leaders immediately pushed back against the new rule Thursday, saying they don't believe in COVID-19 vaccination mandates.
Reynolds vowed to take legal action against the mandate. Last week, Reynolds had also joined nine other states in suing the Biden administration over its vaccination requirement for federal workers. The new lawsuit will be separate.
""Biden's plan pits Americans against Americans while forcing them to choose between making a living or standing up for their personal beliefs,"" said Reynolds, who is vaccinated for COVID-19 but has been a staunch opponent of mandating the shots. ""Biden's actions will only worsen the existing workforce shortages and supply chain issues that hinder our economic recovery.""
Republican Party of Iowa chair Jeff Kaufmann said in a statement that the party supports Reynolds' lawsuit and that the Biden administration ""has has absolutely overstepped their power.""
Democrats responded by praising Biden's leadership on the pandemic. Wahls said Republicans haven't presented a plan to end the pandemic.
""At least the Biden administration is doing something,"" he told reporters Thursday. ""What are the Republicans doing?""
Regarding confusion surrounding Iowa's new law, iowa Democratic Party chair Ross Wilburn said that speed has likely led to uncertainty around how it will work.
""The confusion is understandable given the pace that this was put together,"" Wilburn said.

The public health director for Cobb and Douglas counties says shes concerned about an uptick in COVID- 19 cases testing positive for three variants.
State District Public Health Director Janet Memark said in her COVID-19 update this week that Cobb County is seeing a slow movement upwards in the number of overall cases, but she is most worried about the rising number of coronavirus variants.
Georgia is the third-highest in the nation, behind Florida and Michigan, for the number of variants detected, Memark said.
People throughout Georgia have tested positive for variants from the United Kingdom, South Africa, Brazil and California, while Cobb has only seen cases of the U.K. and South African variants.
Memark said that only 2% of specimens are tested for variants.
Both strains found in Cobb are believed to be more contagious and potentially more deadly than the typical COVID-19 virus.
Research indicates that current vaccines offer protection against most variants, Memark said.
Memark urged those who have yet to receive vaccines to make appointments as soon as possible. She also asked for everyone to continue wearing masks in public, washing hands frequently, and social distancing.
President Joe Biden has asked states to restore mask mandates, and the director of the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control has described feeling a sense of impending doom over fears of a fourth wave of COVID-19 cases.
If we delay, we will lose this battle against the fourth surge that is trying to take hold in our community, Memark said.

470,"BOSTON — Boston College is down another man.
The basketball team that struggled to fill out a lineup as COVID-19 protocols chipped away at the roster lost coach Jim Christian on Monday when he was fired with three weeks remaining in his seventh season.
The Eagles are 3-13 with just one win in 10 Atlantic Coast Conference games. Athletic director Pat Kraft said assistant Scott Spinelli will coach the team the rest of the season.
“I know that Jim gave everything that he had into leading our program and mentoring our student-athletes,” said Kraft, who inherited Christian from his predecessors. “Ultimately, the program is not headed in the right direction, and though I hesitate to make a midseason coaching change in any sport, now is the right time for us.”
Christian went 78-132 (26-94 ACC) in seven years at BC, struggling to recruit top talent and supplementing his roster with graduate transfers who showed promise. But he couldn’t elevate the school from the also-rans of the ACC, and the Big East before it.
The shallow roster proved devastating this season, when the Eagles were down to four available scholarship players because of positive coronavirus tests and contact tracing.
“That’s the 2020, new part,” Christian said on the ACC conference call Monday morning, a couple of hours before his departure.
was announced. “There’s no playbook for that. It’s just a feel. It’s not easy, but the guys are doing a great job getting through it.”
Once a stopping point for coaches like Bob Cousy, Chuck Daly, Tom Davis and Gary Williams, Boston College more recently has struggled to find someone who could restore the program to relevance.
BC, which has never reached the NCAA Final Four, made it to the regional final in 1994 under Jim O’Brien and won a first-round game in his final two seasons before he moved on to Ohio State. Al Skinner took over in 1997 and from 2001-10 took the Eagles to the tournament seven times.
But they haven’t been back since 2009, Skinner’s next-to-last season. Steve Donahue was hired away from Cornell and lasted four seasons before he was replaced by Christian, another small-school coach looking to make an impact in the Power Five.
A winner for most of the dozen years he spent at Kent State, TCU and Ohio, Christian was hired by then-BC athletic director Brad Bates. After going 7-25 in his second season — including an 0-18 record in the ACC — Christian had the Eagles above .500 two years later.
It would be his only winning season in Chestnut Hill.
Christian’s job was said to be in jeopardy after BC went 14-17 the next year, and after a 13-19 record in 2019-20 new athletic director Martin Jarmond said he had a “heart-to-heart” with Christian about the program’s future. With the pandemic canceling the NCAA Tournament and leaving this season in doubt, Jarmond said “it was not a time to introduce a lot of change when there’s a lot of uncertainty.”
“There’s uncertainty when we’re going to have students back on campus, there’s uncertainty about graduation, there’s uncertainty about the fall,” he said. “With so much uncertainty, I just feel it’s important to have stability in your leadership.”
Jarmond left in May and was replaced a month later by Kraft.
The Eagles opened the season with a respectable 76-67 loss to then-No. 3 Villanova and then beat Rhode Island. They then lost nine of their next 11 games, with five others postponed during a 21-day coronavirus shutdown.
They had just four scholarship players available for a Feb. 2 game against No. 20 Florida State that was eventually called off — because of a positive test on the Seminoles. BC had just six scholarship players against North Carolina State and Wake Forest, and seven for Saturday’s game against Syracuse — all losses.
“It’s not easy,” Christian said Saturday after the 75-67 loss to Syracuse that would turn out to be his finale. “Obviously, we’re not the only ones going through that. But that’s the facts.”

472,"Publication: The Clause, , Azusa Pacific University, Azusa, CAWhat does this mean as we approach the holiday season?
On Nov. 26, 2021, the World Health Organization released a statement revealing a new COVID-19 variant: Omicron. They have located the origin of the variant in South Africa. WHO officials say that the first known confirmed infection from Omicron was on Nov. 9 in South Africa. 
The CDC confirmed the first case of Omicron in San Francisco on Wednesday. The individual returned from South Africa on Nov. 22. In an online statement, the CDC states that the individuals is experiencing mild symptoms and are self-quarantining. Those who have been in close contact with them have also been notified and have not tested positive.
With this new variant, what is there to expect? 
The WHO tells us that it’s not yet clear if Omicron is more transmissible or severe compared to other variants. Because the variant has only been discovered recently, there is little research available. Scientists around the globe are working to study Omicron and its behaviors.
In early studies, Omicron has shown signs of “increased risk of infection” for those who have had COVID-19 previously. The variant can be detected using a PCR test, but no studies have shown it can be detected using a rapid antigen test. 
What are the protocols? 
Much like the Delta variant, countries are asked to keep tight surveillance on the number of cases they have. The WHO also asks individuals to continue to practice self-distancing, wear masks, avoid large crowds, keep hands clean and get vaccinated. 
As a precaution, the U.S. has closed off its borders to South Africa and seven other countries starting Nov. 29, 2021. Biden released a statement on Nov. 26, urging Americans to get vaccinated or get their booster shot. 
As of Wednesday, Omicron has been reported in 25 countries. 
How will this affect the holidays?
Currently, there are no changes to holiday travel restrictions and festivities. In a press briefing on Wednesday morning, President Joe Biden announced that shelves will be “well-stocked and they’re ready to meet the consumer demand for the holidays.” He remains cautious but has not made any final decisions. On Nov. 23, Biden also made 50 million barrels of oil available in an effort to lower gas prices. 
The Omicron variant is being monitored and studied worldwide. Countries are treating travel restrictions and lockdowns with caution. The CDC is asking all Americans to follow the WHO guidelines to help prevent the spread of the new variant.

",A New Variant of the COVID-19 Virus Has Surfaced
473,"INDIANAPOLIS, Ind. — College basketball in March can be one defining moment for any guard looking to label himself a winner.
It is when reputations are made.
Iowa's CJ Fredrick and Joe Toussaint were excited to climb onto the big stage for the first time in March 2020, pacing in their Indianapolis hotel rooms while waiting to get on the bus that would take them to the bright lights of the Big Ten Conference tournament.
The call they were dreading came shortly before departure. The postseason was gone before it started for the Hawkeyes. The COVID-19 pandemic got the final word in 2019-20.
""I wasn't surprised, but I was mad,"" said Toussaint, a freshman starting point guard for a 21-11 Iowa team he felt was coming off its best week of practices of the winter.
""It wasn't a good 48 hours for anybody,"" Fredrick concurred.
Fredrick, Iowa's starting shooting guard, stood forlornly in the hotel lobby after the announcement, consoled by parents Chuck and Laura. He said he found perspective by thinking about seniors Ryan Kriener, Riley Till and Bakari Evelyn seeing their Hawkeye careers come to an abrupt end.
Fredrick and Toussaint knew they'd be back. That hasn't made the wait easy.
""It's been a looooong time,"" Toussaint told the Register on Wednesday, stretching the word out to indicate his impatience.
""But I've got the mindset since I stepped foot on the campus, I'm going to be the best version of me I can be. I'm going to play to the best of my ability. I'm going to do things to win for the team. March is definitely a month where it can change your life around. I'm just ready to produce.""
The No. 6 Hawkeyes have positioned themselves for a pair of March tournament runs after a 20-7 regular season that has them as a 3 seed in the Big Ten event and a likely 2 seed in the NCAAs. They won't even have to leave Indianapolis after arriving Wednesday toting four weeks' worth of clothing.
Toussaint, who is backing up senior Jordan Bohannon this season, predicted he wouldn't sleep much in the 48 hours leading up to Iowa's 8 p.m. tipoff Friday. But he never does before big games, he said. He spends the time meditating, visualizing the high-profile competition to come.
Iowa awaits either Wisconsin (the 6 seed), Penn State (11) or Nebraska (14) in its Big Ten tournament opener, to be broadcast on Big Ten Network. Iowa was 4-0 against those opponents in the regular season, including a road win over the Badgers.
Fredrick and Toussaint showed their mettle in March in high school. They believe that experience was valuable even in a college setting because they've experienced the magnifying glass that comes when championships are on the line, particularly for guards who have the basketball in their hands more frequently.
Fredrick led Covington Catholic, a small school south of Cincinnati, to a Kentucky state title as a senior. That state throws all of its high schools into a single class and brings the survivors to Lexington's Rupp Arena for a winner-take-all frenzy. Fredrick didn't flinch in that atmosphere, scoring 111 points on 63% shooting in four games, then cutting down the same nets he had just singed.
""My high school team was really connected,"" Fredrick noted Tuesday. ""That's one of the reasons we were able to make a huge run there. And I see a lot of the same thing in this team now. We're really connected and we're ready to embrace the moment.""
Fredrick missed 51/2 games this season while dealing with injuries to his right foot. But he still was an honorable mention all-conference selection by the Big Ten coaches, a sign of the respect he has earned in his first two seasons. He's a steady ball-handler, a dangerous shooter and an important perimeter defender for Iowa.
Those are skills that are needed this month more than any, Toussaint believes. He agreed with the notion that it is guard play that often separates the great teams from the also-rans this time of year, expanding on that notion by saying:
""Especially having a big man like Luka Garza, you just have to be sharp getting him the ball. Knowing when you need to shoot. Knowing when you need to pass. Knowing when you need to penetrate. Being great on defense every single possession. It falls on the guards, where our defense begins, from the beginning to the end. They're going to feed off our energy.""
Garza is Iowa's all-American center and two-time winner of Big Ten player of the year. He is averaging 24 points a game and commanding double-teams. Junior wing player Joe Wieskamp is second on the team at 15 points a game, although his playing status is unknown after suffering a right ankle sprain in Sunday's home win over Wisconsin. Bohannon is a fifth-year senior who has a school-record 625 career assists but also the moxie to take over a game late from the 3-point arc or the free-throw line.
Those are Iowa's top options. But no team wins in March without role players on the rise.
Toussaint has seen his playing time increase recently, averaging 14 minutes per game in Iowa's current three-game winning streak, with 13 assists against three turnovers. He's not the leader on this team yet that he was as a sophomore at Cardinal Hayes High School in the Bronx, New York. He led his team to a City League championship that season, an ultra-competitive tournament in America's largest city.
Toussaint said he quickly learned how different playoff basketball is as compared to regular-season contests.
""Every possession counts, and you've got to play smart. There's no time for 'My bads,' 'My faults,' or 'I missed this; I'll get it next time.' Because you never know, there might not be a next time until next year. You've got to be mentally sharp and focused,"" Toussaint said.
That's what was keeping Toussaint up at night this week. Like Fredrick, he is largely unknown among college basketball observers nationally. What he does in March could shape that narrative. Helping Iowa win tournament games is the best way to be remembered positively.
""Once I get on the court, I've got to make sure people know I'm on the court. I'm here. My teammates. The other teams. The audience,"" Toussaint said.
""At any given moment, it could be my time. And I'm sure I'm ready for it. I'm just here to win.""

475,"Oct. 7--Exactly how many people will vote early will be difficult to predict amid the nearly two-year-old COVID-19 pandemic, but Butler County election officials believe turnout could be driven by vote-by-mail ballots.
More than 700 vote-by-mail ballots were sent out Tuesday morning to Butler County voters, the first day of early voting for the Nov. 2 election. And 100 people voted Tuesday at the elections office on Princeton Road in Hamilton.
Compared to Day 1 of early voting in the 2019 general election, Tuesday saw nearly twice the number of in-office votes cast, and 161 more requested vote-by-mail ballots sent out. Predicting voter turnout for this election, however, won't be easy, at least for now, said Butler County Board of Elections Deputy Director Eric Corbin.
""It's definitely going to be harder to predict,"" he said. ""One thing that we do expect to see     if it's not this general election it'll be likely in the 2022 general election     is more people voting by mail than what our average has been over the past several years,"" he said.
It's more difficult because there are no statewide issues on this ballot, which usually drives turnout down, but a record number of people voted by mail in 2020 because they ""found out how easy it was,"" Corbin said.
Historically, local-year elections     odd-numbered years when village and city councils, township elected offices, and school boards are up for election     without statewide ballot measures are low voter-turnout elections.
In 2019, 19.1% of Butler County's voters participated with no statewide measures. Voter turnout was higher in 2017 (25.3%) with two statewide measures, and it was more than doubled in 2015 (40.61%) with three statewide measures, including the legalization effort for recreational marijuana.
Early voting and voting by mail experienced record highs in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 52,200 votes were cast by mail, and more than 112,100 early ballots were cast in November 2020.
Also, with no mask mandate, that's another variable that makes it hard to forecast an expected voter turnout percentage, Corbin said. There are more than 255,000 registered Butler County voters.
Early voting is open every weekday at the Butler County Board of Elections, 1802 Princeton Road, until Nov. 1.
Weekend voting will be Oct. 30 and 31. To request a vote-by-mail ballot, visit VoteOhio.gov. All vote-by-mail ballots must be postmarked by Nov. 1, or hand-delivered to the board of elections office by 7:30 p.m. Nov. 2.

FACTS & FIGURES
Voting totals are often driven by the election year     local office years versus federal and statewide office years     and what's on the ballot. Statewide ballot measures often increase voter turnout, especially in odd-year elections when voters decide village and city council, township office, and school board races. Here's the percent of early voters that voted by mail:
2020-: 46.6% (52,198 votes by mail)
2019-: 29.9% (1,757 votes by mail)
2018: 54% (21,749 votes by mail)
2017: 53.5% (29,983 votes by mail)
2016-: 50.7% (5,057 votes by mail)

482,"
Scientists are settling on a road map that can help critical sectors of the economy safely conduct business, from meatpacking plants to financial services, despite the pandemic's continued spread.
After nearly a year of study, the lessons include: Mask-wearing, worker pods and good air flow are much more important than surface cleaning, temperature checks and plexiglass barriers in places like offices and restaurants. And more public-health experts now advocate wide use of cheap, rapid tests to detect cases quickly, in part because many scientists now think more than 50% of infections are transmitted by people without symptoms.
The playbook comes after months of investigations on how the coronavirus spreads and affects the body. Scientists combined that with knowledge gained from years of experience managing occupational-health hazards in high-risk workplaces, such as factories and chemical plants, where tiny airborne pollutants can build up and cause harm. They say different types of workplaces -- taking into account the types of interactions workers have -- need slightly different protocols.
The safety measures have taken on new urgency in recent weeks as new infections, hospitalizations and deaths rise across the U.S. and Europe, and potentially more-transmissible variants of the virus spread around the globe. This phase of the pandemic is prompting a new wave of stay-at-home orders, closures and travel restrictions, important first steps to curbing contagion. Infection-prevention specialists say known strategies for stemming spread should continue to work against the new variants, but that increased adherence is even more important.
Vaccines are rolling out, but slowly, and access will be limited mostly to high-priority groups for some time.
""We have to still deal with 'the right now.' We've zeroed in on this set of controls that we know work,"" said Joseph Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings Program at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.
Over the past year, the lack of consistent and cohesive messaging among scientists and lawmakers has seeded confusion over what makes up risky behavior, what activities should be avoided and why. That is beginning to change as consensus builds and scientists better understand the virus.
In the U.S., scientists at first advised people against wearing masks, in part because of shortages, while the idea of stay-at-home orders received severe pushback from some lawmakers. Early in the pandemic, testing was limited to people with symptoms, also partly due to shortages. That advice has shifted, but a year later, sufficient testing remains a critical issue.
Countries such as New Zealand and others in Asia adhered to a combination of basic mitigation strategies from the start -- particularly masking, large-scale testing and lockdowns that broke transmission chains. They have tended to fare better than those that didn't.
In one of his first moves, President Biden signed executive orders to require masks be worn on federal property and at airports and other transportation hubs. The administration said it is focusing on increasing the availability of vaccines, and also stressed the importance of widely available testing, which still lags in low-income and minority communities.
The current scientific playbook follows from two of the biggest research insights since the start of the pandemic. First, individuals who aren't showing symptoms can transmit the virus. Infectious-disease experts worry most about this silent spread and say it is the reason the pandemic has been so hard to contain. While visibly sick people can pass on the virus, data cited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 40% to 45% of those infected never develop symptoms at all. With the new viral variants that can transmit more readily, the potential for silent spread is even higher, infectious-disease experts said.
Secondly, researchers now know that tiny airborne particles known as aerosols play a role in the spread of Covid-19. These can linger in the air and travel beyond 6 feet.
An early hallmark of the pandemic response focused on the risk of transmission through large respiratory droplets that typically travel a few feet and then fall to the ground. Businesses rushed to buy plexiglass barriers, creating shortages.
The barriers can be good at preventing larger virus-containing droplets from landing on and infecting healthy individuals. They may offer some protection in shielding workers who have brief face-to-face interactions with many people throughout the workday, such as cashiers and receptionists, some occupational-health experts said.
Yet in settings like offices, restaurants or gyms, the role of the barriers is murkier, because activities like talking loudly and breathing deeply create aerosols that can waft on air currents and get around shields.
Also, installing such barriers could affect airflow throughout the space, environmental-health experts said. It is possible they could limit proper ventilation, making things worse, they said.
""There seems to be an assumption that particles are going to get stopped by the barriers, which is simply not true,"" said Lisa Brosseau, an industrial hygienist and research consultant for the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. Airborne particles ferrying the virus ""really distribute all over the place.""
The emphasis on intense surface cleaning has diminished as scientists have come to understand that indirect transmission through contaminated surfaces doesn't play as critical a role in the spread of Covid-19 as they thought in the early days of the pandemic.
Temperature checks have become less popular among some employers because scientists now know that not all Covid-19 patients get fevers. One large study published online in November in the New England Journal of Medicine showed only 13% of Covid-19 patients reported a fever during the course of their illness.
Scientists now understand that brief encounters with an infected person can lead to spread, according to an October case study -- an advance from earlier, when the rule of thumb was to avoid close contact for 15 consecutive minutes or longer. The report urged people to consider not just time and proximity in defining close contact, but also ventilation, crowding and a person's likelihood of generating aerosols. Following the report, the CDC changed its definition of close contact to a total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period.
Fresh air and effective filters indoors are important because they can remove virus particles before they have time to infect.
Masks offer a similar benefit, by lowering the amount of particles that infected individuals emit. Some scientists say there could be a benefit to doubling up on masks, as a second layer may improve both filtration and fit, so long as the masks are worn correctly.
A study published in October found that in countries where mask wearing was the norm or where governments put in place mask mandates, coronavirus mortality rates grew much more slowly than in countries without such measures. This fall, the CDC said that masks also offer some personal protection by reducing a wearer's exposure to infected particles.
""For Covid, those two factors -- asymptomatic spread and aerosolization -- is what made mask-wearing so essential,"" said Megan Ranney, emergency physician and assistant dean at Brown University.
Lessons can be gleaned from an outbreak at a Canadian spin studio last fall. The operators of the Spinco studio in Hamilton, Ontario, had many public-health measures in place, including limiting the number of bikes in each class and screening staff and attendees with a questionnaire. Rooms were sanitized within 30 minutes of a completed class, and towels were laundered, according to a statement provided by Elizabeth Richardson, medical officer of health for the city of Hamilton.
Masks were also required before and after workout classes, Dr. Richardson said.
In total, 54 people who attended workouts over a span of several classes became infected. Another 31 cases were tied to the outbreak after spin-class attendees who contracted the virus then passed it on. The spin studio temporarily shut down following the outbreak and later reopened. It is currently not offering classes due to local regulations that mandated the closure of fitness centers amid rising Covid-19 cases.
In a November statement following the outbreak, Michelle August, founder of Spinco, said that the company has ""always put safety first and [has] exceeded all recommended guidelines from public health throughout"" the pandemic. She said Spinco has also strengthened and heightened its Covid-19 mitigation measures. Spinco's website currently says face masks are mandated throughout workouts in the company's Hamilton location.
It also says that Spinco is installing air purifiers in all of its studios that filter air in the rooms every 17 to 21 minutes. Airborne transmission experts recommend that building managers pump in fresh air between three to six times an hour and that they install filters that are proven to effectively trap and remove a substantial number of virus-carrying particles.
To film a stage play of ""A Christmas Carol"" in November, the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis upgraded its air filters and increased the rate at which the ventilation system pumps in outside air, said Brooke Hajinian, the Guthrie's general manager. Management staggered arrival times, and a compliance officer made sure everyone socially distanced, wore their masks properly and washed their hands.
The theater divided staff into pods depending on how close they must get to the lone actor on stage, who portrayed Charles Dickens and didn't wear a mask while performing, according to Ms. Hajinian. Those working nearest the stage underwent testing three times a week and wore N95 masks, she said, while cleaning and security crews, who didn't interact with the stage crews, wore cloth masks and didn't undergo testing.
Ms. Hajinian said she monitored the staff's testing results and symptoms. ""Any symptom is not a failure of this plan,"" she said. Catching a case ""and isolating it -- that's what success looks like for us,"" she said. There were no cases, she said.
Scientists say multilayered safety efforts are needed because no single prevention method is 100% effective.
One of the largest studies of asymptomatic transmission to date showed that frequent testing was essential in identifying infections among a group of nearly 2,000 Marine recruits required to socially distance and wear masks except while eating and sleeping.
The study looked at cases identified with lab-based tests that search out and amplify the genetic material of the virus, but those tests aren't as easily scaled as rapid antigen tests, which search for viral proteins.
Results from lab-based tests can sometimes take days, while results from rapid tests are usually available in less than an hour. As a result, some epidemiologists have been advocating for widespread use of antigen tests to prevent outbreaks, because they are cheaper and don't require high-tech laboratory equipment to run.
""Unless we're doing really broad, frequent screening of the people at large, we're completely missing the vast majority"" of infections, said Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. ""We have to change how we're doing this.""
While rapid tests tend to be less sensitive than lab-based tests, Dr. Mina said the data suggest they have high sensitivity when people are most likely to be infectious.
In places without big surges, a high-tech approach is becoming increasingly useful: genetic epidemiology, or tracking tiny changes in viral genomes to map out transmission chains. As the coronavirus replicates and moves from person to person, its genes change slightly. Sometimes, those tiny changes are unusual, and they can be particularly useful in mapping transmission events, according to Justin O'Grady, an infectious disease expert at the Quadram Institute in the U.K.
By sifting through the differences among more than 1,000 viral genomes, Dr. O'Grady and his collaborators found that a particular viral variant was moving through multiple nursing homes in the U.K. but not among the wider community. The unpublished data suggested that transmission was facilitated by the movement of staff from one facility to another, Dr. O'Grady said. The team relayed the findings to government authorities and advised them to restrict staff moving among facilities during the pandemic.
""Sometimes genomic epidemiology is able to find hidden transmission links that traditional epidemiology would struggle to find,"" Dr. O'Grady said. ""We can't stop transmission, but when we find a superspreader event . . . we can bring in the right prevention methods to stop it from spreading further.""

483,"Jul. 2 - No matter the vitality of Wall Street, no matter the rate of unemployment, no matter the reading produced by any measuring tool that gauges the status of pandemic recovery, there can be no full rebound from COVID-19 without ensuring the health  -  physical, emotional and mental  -  of students.
Advocates for Pennsylvania students have raised concern about the adequacy of school-based mental health services as the state prepares for a coming school year that anticipates a return to classroom-based, in-person instruction.
School officials are girding for an increased demand for mental health services. But the demand will go unmet unless services are increased.
A recent joint state House committee hearing shined a spotlight on the concerns as stakeholders testified before the education and human services committees. Officials from both the education and human services offices, psychologists, mental health services providers and school principals painted a picture of impending need.
For more than a year, many students bounced from one learning method to another, at-home learning or a mix of in-person/at-home instruction. It doesn't take an expert to conclude that the situation created learning gaps and some level of emotional/mental stress for at least some students and, very likely, the majority  -  if for no other reason than the transfer of stress from parent/family to kid.
The state education department is warning they expected greater need for mental health services in the fall. They've received anecdotal information of increased absenteeism this school year as well as feelings of disconnectedness. This is no surprise. Even before the pandemic, a significant swath of students struggled with mental health issues.
The state education department should tap into federal money from the American Rescue Plan to bolster school-based mental health services. The Association of School Psychologists of Pennsylvania suggests that more school psychologists be hired and that graduate students be tapped to address a shortage in the field. Though American Rescue Plan funding is expected to last only two years, that period of time could be sufficient to meet the immediate needs for some extra mental health support as students adjust to a return to comparative normalcy in the fa

484,"Iowa Workforce Development issued the following news release:Iowa's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate decreased to 3.7 percent in January from the revised December rate of 3.9 percent. The state's jobless rate was 4.4 percent one year ago. The U.S. unemployment rate in January increased to 4.0 percent.The total number of unemployed Iowans decreased to 62,700 in January, down 2,200 from revised December data. Iowa businesses added 3,000 jobs in January, and the total number of working Iowans increased by 6,900 to 1,617,700. The labor force participation rate increased slightly to 66.8 percent.""These numbers show Iowa's economic recovery is continuing to press forward,"" said Beth Townsend, Director of Iowa Workforce Development. ""IWD's role is to continue that momentum by getting unemployed Iowans back into the workforce as quickly as possible. Since January, more than 640 Iowans involved in our Reemployment Case Management program have found new jobs. We will work as hard as possible to keep that number growing.""The last five years of monthly labor force data (2017-2021) recently were revised as required by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. This ""benchmarking"" is the periodic process of re-estimating statistics as more complete data becomes available, such as updated data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Prior-year estimates for the Current Employment Statistics (CES) and Local Area Unemployment Statistics (LAUS) programs - key statistical measures of employment - are benchmarked annually. Revised data are incorporated in January employment statistics when they are released each March.Seasonally Adjusted Nonfarm EmploymentIowa businesses added 3,000 jobs in January, lifting total nonfarm employment to 1,556,300. Much of the increase stemmed from those industries involved in goods production, although service industries had some gains, particularly those related to accommodations and eating and drinking establishments. Private industries advanced by 1,600 jobs, and government added 1,400 (with 800 jobs being in local government). Compared to last year, government is now up 7,900 jobs, mostly due to growth at the local level.Leisure and hospitality added the most jobs in January (+2,500). Aside from a mild loss of 800 jobs in December, this industry has generally trended up steadily since COVID quarantine efforts. Most gains were within accommodations and food services, which are up 6,500 jobs since August. Manufacturing added 1,700 jobs, with the bulk of gains in nondurable goods production (+1,100) and many related to food production and animal slaughtering and processing. Construction gained 600 jobs and now has added 2,800 jobs over the past three months. Sector losses were led by professional and business services (-2,200), mostly stemming from the administrative management and waste remediation services industry. This sector has been sluggish for several months and trails last year's mark by 2,700 jobs. Other services lost 1,000 jobs, mostly as a result of cutbacks in personal care industries. Smaller losses included trade, transportation, and utilities (-700) and information (-200).Annually, total nonfarm employment is up 31,100 jobs (+2.0 percent). Leisure and hospitality continue to restaff and lead all sectors with 16,500 jobs, most of which (+14,000) are within accommodations and food services. Manufacturing has added 4,200 jobs. Gains have been in both durable and nondurable goods workshops. Construction has shown some recent signs of hiring and is now up 2,800 jobs. Annual job losses have been led by health care and social assistance (-3,200). This sector has been slower to rehire to pre-pandemic levels and has shed 800 jobs in the last two months. Finance and insurance have been slowly reducing staff levels and are down 900 jobs compared to last January.MEDIA ALERT:  Local data for January 2022 is available on the IWD website.

490,"Kyle Trask's final game as a Gator — a 55-20 loss to Oklahoma — doesn't define his legacy at Florida, but it should.
The two-star recruit turned Heisman Trophy finalist will be remembered for setting single-season school records in passing yards (4,283) and touchdowns (43), marks that rank second and third, respectively, in SEC history.
""Stats are cool,"" Trask said this season, ""but they don't always win games.""
His career, however, is bigger than wins and losses, and can't be summed up by statistics.
Trask's story is one in a million, defined by his patience, leadership and loyalty more than touchdowns or records. Those qualities were on full display — one last time — in the Cotton Bowl last week.
Trask never considered not playing against Oklahoma, even after his top three receiving targets decided to opt out for the NFL. Trask had his own draft stock to consider, which was underscored for him the night before the game.
The quarterback he famously played behind in high school, D'Eriq King, suffered a torn ACL in Miami's bowl game. Just over 24 hours later, Trask was still taking the field for the Gators.
Kyle Pitts, Kadarius Toney and Trevon Grimes became the second UF trio in school history to all have at least nine receiving touchdowns in a season (the other was 1996). Their absences was the equivalent of taking Reidel Anthony, Ike Hilliard and Jacquez Green out of the lineup for former Florida quarterback Danny Wuerffel.
And with Jacob Copeland — the team's leading receiver in yards per catch — testing positive for COVID-19, Trask was down four pass catchers who combined for 174 catches for 2,778 yards and 34 touchdowns.
""It obviously was a little more challenging,"" Trask said of playing without that production. ""You think about it, you've got a whole offseason to get timing down with that group of guys. And since we had so many opt-outs, we only had about two or three days of practice to get the timing down with the next guys up.
""That's not making excuses or anything, but that's just the amount of work that goes into this. You don't just flip a switch and you end up in the end zone. It takes a lot of work to get there.""
For the first time in his two years as a starter, Trask didn't score once and three threw interceptions in a game. He also posted career lows for passing yards (158 yards) and quarterback rating (21.6).
Despite the results, Trask had no regrets.
""Obviously it's difficult,"" he said, ""But at the same time, you've got to look at the big picture. ... It's just been a wild ride, and I've enjoyed every second of it. This isn't the way you want to go out, but when I look back on all the memories and friendships I made here, it's all worth it.""
Perhaps more admirable than Trask's decision to play was his reaction to being benched. At halftime, Florida coach Dan Mullen told Trask he would let him play the first series and then go from there.
After the offense went four plays and out, Mullen decided to insert backup quarterback Emory Jones and start building for the future. Trask took it like a pro, but wasn't thrilled about the move either.
""To share with you, Kyle, he wanted to play. It says a lot about him,"" Mullen said of Trask's reaction. ""I don't want to underplay what an amazing year and what an amazing career he has had. I was here with Tim Tebow, an unbelievable career.
""But Tim Tebow played, won a national championship as a freshman, Heisman as a sophomore, played a lot right from day one. Kyle Trask had an unbelievable career because of the adversities he overcame, the character he had to get to where he is. Boy, that is special.""
How special?
After getting pulled in his final game — the worst of his career — Trask didn't go sit on the bench and sulk with his head down. He stayed engaged in a blowout loss, signaling plays for Jones and giving him advice on the sideline between drives.
When Anthony Richardson threw a touchdown late in the game, Trask sprinted onto the field and was the first player to celebrate with the freshman quarterback.
Those are the little things from Trask that leave a big impression on NFL personnel, and even opposing coaches.
""Kyle Trask has been one of the best quarterbacks in the country this year,"" Oklahoma coach Lincoln Riley said. ""I told him after the game, I know this is my profession but, also, as just a fan of college football, I very much appreciate him for what he did in high school, hanging through it when a lot of other people would have left.
""What he did playing in this game, even though he's got a really bright future ahead of him. I very, very much appreciate it. I hope college football can keep people like Kyle Trask involved. And all the respect in the world for him.""

493,"David Quinn is set to coach the U.S. men's hockey team at the upcoming Winter Olympics after the NHL decided not to send players to Beijing.
USA Hockey named Quinn coach and John Vanbiesbrouck general manager Monday in the first shift to plan B for another Olympics without NHL participation.
Quinn replaces Pittsburgh Penguins coach Mike Sullivan. He was supposed to be an assistant under Sullivan and was the only member of the coaching staff not currently working in the NHL.
The 55-year-old Quinn coached the New York Rangers the past three seasons after five years at Boston University. Quinn most recently coached for the U.S. internationally as an assistant at the 2016 world championships and was also on staff for that tournament in 2007 and 2012.
Former Montreal Canadiens coach Claude Julien is expected to be behind the bench for Canada, replacing back-to-back Stanley Cup winner Jon Cooper of the Tampa Bay Lightning. Former Arizona Coyotes captain Shane Doan is considered the leading candidate to be GM after Hockey Canada used an international tune-up tournament in Moscow to put together an Olympic backup plan without an NHL presence.

495,"(TNSops) -- The National Digital Inclusion Alliance issued the following news:The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted the lack of digital equity for millions of households within communities of all kinds - big cities, small towns, suburban as well as rural and tribal communities. The majority of federal resources focused on the digital divide addressed the lack of broadband service in rural areas. While the challenge of the availability of internet service is urgent, our nation's digital divide is also driven by huge disparities in broadband adoption.Through stimulus packages, broadband affordability was directly addressed while other stimulus funding is addressing digital inclusion in general (affordable or subsidized home internet service and devices along with community-based digital literacy training and navigation) through open ended funding provisions. To encourage use of stimulus funds for digital inclusion, NDIA encourages digital inclusion practitioners and advocates to share information about local programming with local and state elected officials, along with local and state broadband offices. The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP) includes provisions that will or could cover the cost of broadband service and devices, broadband infrastructure deployment, broadband mapping and broadband adoption. The rules for use of these funds have not yet been distributed by the authority agency. * The Emergency Connectivity Fund ($7.171 billion) - Reimburses schools and libraries for providing free broadband service (and connected devices) to students and patrons at their homes. This Fund is likely to be used for sponsored / single payer agreements. * Institute for Museum and Library Services ($200 million) - Grant funding for necessary expenses to carry out museum and library services. * The Coronavirus Capital Projects Fund ($10 billion) - Treasury will distribute funds to States, territories, and Tribal governments to carry out critical capital projects directly enabling work, education, and health monitoring, including remote options, in response to the pandemic. The funding could be limited to broadband and broadband adoption. * The Local Fiscal Recovery Fund ($350 billion) - Treasury will distribute funds to municipalities and counties, tribes, territories and states to keep first responders, frontline health workers, teachers, and other providers of vital services safely on the job as states, local governments, Tribes, and territories roll out vaccines and fight to rebuild Main Street economies. Digital inclusion is assumed to be an eligible use of funds.* The Homeowners Assistance Fund ($9.961 billion) - Treasury will make grants to states to administer programs assisting homeowners with mortgage payments and related costs including internet service.The Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA), enacted on December 27, 2020 includes the Emergency Broadband Benefit (EBB) program - $3.2 billion to reimburse internet service providers $10 to $50 per month for providing broadband service to households (up to $75 a month for tribal households) and up to $100 reimbursement for tablets and laptops, one per eligible household. For more information, see NDIA's EBB Page. The CAA includes other provisions that address digital equity. These programs fall under the authority of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration and Federal Communications Commission. Rules for these programs have not been released. * The Office of Minority Broadband Initiatives ($285 Million) - Collaborate with Federal agencies to carry out broadband internet access service support programs to determine how to expand access to broadband internet access service and other digital opportunities in anchor communities.* The Tribal Connectivity Program ($1 billion) - Grants to eligible entities to expand access to and adoption of broadband service on Tribal land; or remote learning, telework, or telehealth resources during the COVID-19 pandemic.* Broadband Expansion to Underserved Communities ($300 million) - Grants for competitively and technologically neutral projects for the deployment of fixed broadband service that provides at least 25/3 in an eligible area (census block with at least one household or business that does not have access to 25/3).This year promises to be a landmark year for digital inclusion advocacy. From legislation focused on affordability and subsidies to programs centered on digital skills, digital equity, devices and broadband infrastructure there are numerous opportunities to advance digital inclusion for underserved communities across the country.[Category: Computer Technology]null-7435984 T40-MgEditor",National Digital Inclusion Alliance: Digital Equity Stimulus Funding
496,"Jul. 2 - WOOSTER Vacation Bible school is an important summer program geared toward children that gives kids an opportunity to do something fun during the summer and show a little bit of God's love.
""As a church, we love putting it on,"" said Director of Discipleship Ali Vizzo at Wooster United Methodist Church. ""A lot of us have memories from when we were young and went to vacation Bible school, and we remember the songs and the games and everything, and this helps create those memories for today's kids as well.""
Church of the Saviour Children's Ministry Director Kathy Wigal said VBS is an important part in the lives of children. She pointed to her own personal experience.
""One of the ways I came to know the Lord was through VBS,"" Wigal said. ""I was not a church kid; my parents did not go to church, so when I was around 7, someone from a local church came to our home and invited me to VBS. I went and started going to my church and I fell in love with Jesus. To me, it's a personal thing that I hope to share with other children.""
Attendance was down at the Wooster United Methodist Church for this year's return to VBS, which was held the week of June 21.
""We held our vacation Bible school over three mornings,"" Vizzo said. ""We had 23 kids this year, which is probably a little more than half of what we had two years ago, the last time we were able to go in person.""
There were also 13 volunteers, including five middle and high school students who were helpers. The theme was Under the Acacia Tree, a regional program to educate kids about Africa University.
""We raised $154 for Africa University to go toward the building of a girls dormitory,"" she said.
Several other churches are planning to hold their VBS during the next few weeks.
Millersburg Christian Church invites children to its Treasured VBS program where children will discover they are priceless to God.
A summer kids' event called Treasured VBS will be hosted at Millersburg Christian Church from Monday, July 5 through Thursday, July 8. At Treasured, kids discover God's greatest treasure isn't diamonds, gems or gold. It's them.
Kids participate in memorable Bible-learning activities, sing catchy songs, play teamwork-building games, make and devour yummy treats and experience  one-of-a-kind Bible adventures to remind them of God's love,"" said Leslie Westbrook of Millersburg Christian Church. ""Plus, kids will learn to look for evidence of God all around them through something called God Sightings.""
Each day will conclude with a closing quest that gets everyone involved in living what they have learned.
""Family members and friends are encouraged to join in a daily reading of the Adventure Take Away guide that will be sent home with the children every night,"" Westbrook added. ""Kids will also join in a mission project effort to provide audio headphones, which are used in every elementary classroom in Holmes County on a daily basis.""
Treasured is for kids from ages 4 years old through those entering into sixth grade and will run from 6 until 8:30 p.m. each day. To register your child for the program online at: https://vbspro.events/p/millersburgcc2021 or call the Millersburg Christian Church at 330-674-1646.
At Church of the Saviour on Fry Road in Wooster, its program for this year will be HolyWord: Lights, Camera, Action VBS.
Church of the Saviour had VBS last year, but it was limited in capacity (following COVID guidelines and restrictions for preschools) and did not reach the amount of kids they hope to see this year.
The program will be held over four nights, Monday through Thursday, July 12-15, from 6 to 8 p.m. for ages 4 through fifth grade.
On Friday evening, families are invited to an outdoor movie. On Sunday, families are invited to experience a red carpet event.
Wigal said the children will be singing during the worship hour and first responders will be recognized and given the 'red carpet' treatment. After service, families are invited to lunch, visits with a fire truck, EMT squad, police car, a HolyWord Photo Booth, limo rides, caricaturist and other fun.
""We will be inviting first responders to come to our morning service on Sunday where we'll honor each of them,"" Wigal said. ""The kids will be making special gifts for them. We'll honor them during our service and invite them to lunch afterwards to show our appreciation for all they do, especially through the pandemic.""
To join VBS, call the church at 330-264-5233 or go to the Facebook page at: https://www.facebook.com/ChurchoftheSaviourWooster.

497,"The White House issued the following transcript of a news briefing on July 8, 2021, by Press Secretary Jen Psaki:* * *MS. PSAKI: Hi, everyone.Q: Hello.MS. PSAKI: Happy Thursday. (Laughter.) Is it Thursday?Q: (Inaudible) ""Happy Birthday""?MS. PSAKI: I said, ""Happy Thursday."" Well, I was going to say -- I did hear it was Steve Holland's 29th birthday. (Laughter.) So, happy 29th birthday. I am a terrible singer, but I am willing to lead a song here if you are all game. (Laughter.)Q: Is this a good day to ask for an interview with the President? (Laughter.) MS. PSAKI: It may be. It may be.Q: You got to at least give him the first question.MS. PSAKI: Who's with me? Someone here has a good voice.(""Happy Birthday"" is sung to Steve Holland.) (Applause.)All right. I will also note: Brian Karem, excellent voice. I don't know what you do with that, but that's one thing I learned today. (Laughter.)Okay, a couple of items for you. Today, as you all know, the President and Vice President will meet with Black leaders from top civil rights organizations. We are about to put out the list of these names if they are not already in your inbox. But that is happening this afternoon. We'll have a readout. We also expect a number of them will go out to the stakeout after the meeting.Later today, Vice President Harris will also deliver remarks at Howard University on how the Democratic National Committee is expanding their ""I Will Vote"" campaign, for which the DNC can give you additional specifics.As the President has been emphatic since taking of- -- before taking office, our constitutional rights are on the line because state legislatures have forced through a wave of anti-voter laws based on the same repeatedly disproven lies that led to an assault on our nation's Capitol in one of the darkest days in the history of American democracy. So the meeting today, the Vice President's event are a part of our ongoing effort to elevate this issue, to work with every lever of the federal government.I also wanted to note, as you may have noticed, we've been doing kind of a daily announcement about our competition executive order. So the new announcement that went out today will -- focuses on saving American businesses money on shipping costs. In turn, that will lower prices for American consumers.A lot of American companies rely on railroads to ship their goods domestically and ocean carriers to ship their goods internationally. Both of these industries have grown more concentrated over time. Many freight routes are monopolized because they're served by a single railroad. Three foreign-owned shipping alliances now control more than 80 percent of the market. I did not know that. I'm learning something new every day with the competition EOs, which I appreciate.That concentration has contributed to a spike in shipping costs and fees during the pandemic. For example, the index price to ship one container has gone up eightfold. And shipping container companies have charged companies massive fees while their goods sit at ports.So, this executive order takes several steps to address these problems. On international shipping, the executive order calls on the Federal Maritime Commission to crack down on unjust and unreasonable fees and work with the Justice Department to investigate and punish anticompetitive conduct.And on domestic freight railroad, the executive order urges the Surface Transportation Board to allow more shippers -- allow shippers to more easily challenge inflated rates when there is no competition between routes.Finally, today we also have more doses that are going out to the world. We will ship 500,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to Uruguay and 1.4 million doses of Johnson & Johnson vaccine to Afghanistan. In the coming days, we will complete the entire 3 million shipment of J&J doses to Afghanistan -- something the President will also mention in his remarks today.Zeke, why don't you kick us off.Q: Thanks, Jen. Yesterday, the President said he would know more today about what he would do in response to Russian ransomware attacks on U.S. entities. What does he plan on doing?MS. PSAKI: Well, first, Zeke, I think what he intended to convey is that he's continuing to be updated by his team on a regular and near-daily basis. And certainly, when they have new information to provide, they provide that to him. So, we are continuing to gather details on if this incident occurred with the knowledge or approval of the Russian government. That's what we're really digging into at this point in time. And while the intelligence community has not yet attributed the attack and we still don't have new information on the attribution as of today, the cyber community -- security community agrees that the criminal group, REvil, that we've talked about a bit in here, operates out of Russia with affiliates around the world. We've been in touch at a high level, as you all know, with Russian -- high-level Russian authorities -- counterparts, I should say -- regarding this incident. And we've continued to send a clear message: If the Russian government cannot or will not act against criminal actors residing in Russia, we will act.In terms of what we will do, I'm not in a position, of course, to discuss operations. That's not in our interest to preview those. But the President sent a clear message to President Putin; we're continuing to send that clear message in our engagements as well.Q: And, on Afghanistan, on the SIV process, any updates on the administration's efforts to find a third country to host processing of those visas, as well as can you confirm the administration is adding additional staff to help vet those applicants? And how long will that take, and how is the administration going to address security concerns among those who are applying for visas here?MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, one of the areas the President will talk about in his remarks this afternoon is certainly ensuring that we are taking care of Afghan nationals who worked side by side with U.S. forces, and the SIV applicants, as you noted, including interpreters and translators.So we have already dramatically accelerated the processing time for Special Immigrant Visas to bring them to the United States. We're working closely with Congress -- we're continuing to work closely with Congress to change the authorizing legislation so that we can streamline the process for approving visas, even when they are in a third country. And we have stood up an operation to physically relocate thousands of these Afghans and their families before the U.S. military mission concludes so that they can wait safely outside of Afghanistan.That operation has identified U.S. facilities outside of the continental United States, as well as third countries. Because of security reasons, we're not going to outline in detail at this point where those are. But I can confirm that we will be conducting flights of our Afghan allies to these locations in August, so, of course, in advance of the timeline of bringing our troops home.Q: And then, we're going to hear from the President later, but is it an acceptable outcome to the President if Kabul were to fall to the Taliban? I mean, that's widely been predicted by experts, including in the U.S. mil- -- in the U.S. government as a potential outcome here of the U.S. withdrawal. Is that an acceptable outcome to the President?MS. PSAKI: Well, first, Zeke, let me say what -- the reason the President is speaking to all of you and the American public today is because he views this as an opportunity to once again communicate to the American people the security challenges he inherited in Afghanistan and affirm why he made the decision he made in April to withdraw our troops and end our involvement in the war.And the question fundamentally facing him was: After 20 years, was he going to commit more American troops to a civil war in Afghanistan? And if we look back 20 years ago, which many people in this room covered when Steve was 9 years old -- I'll just -- by math -- (laughter) -- we -- we did what we wanted to do, which was we got the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11, we delivered justice to Osama bin Laden, we degraded al Qaeda's capacity to the point they did not present an active threat to our homeland.He made the decision after a clear-eyed assessment, in part because he's never seen there to be a military end to this war, and also because, as we came into office, we had an agreed-to timeline. After May 1st, the uptick in violence was coming this summer; the status quo was not sustainable. And we are still continuing to support diplomatically -- through security assistance, humanitarian assistance -- the ongoing efforts in Afghanistan, including a political negotiation process that's ongoing that we expect the ambassador to continue to return to. So, we have always anticipated, Zeke -- and the President was very clear about this when he made his speech in April -- that there would be an uptick in violence, that there would be an uptick in turmoil on the ground. We knew that, and we knew the security situation would become more difficult. But he made the decision in part because, if you look back at recent history: In 2011, the NATO Allies and partners agreed that we would end our combat mission by 2014. In 2014, some argued for more -- for one more year. So we kept fighting, kept taking casualties. If we did not make the decision we did, there would have been severe consequences. That's why he made it. Q: Do you believe it's still --MS. PSAKI: Go ahead. Oh, go ahead, Steve.Q: Do you believe it's still possible that the Afghan Security Forces can repel the Taliban?MS. PSAKI: Well, certainly, under -- as we expected, the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces are now under real pressure, and that was certainly a part of the discussion the President had with Afghan leaders just two weeks ago. And we're going to continue to provide funding and ensure they have capacity to maintain the Air Force.And I would remind you that even since we were -- since we engaged, together with our NATO Allies and partners, we have trained and equipped nearly 300,000 currently-serving members of the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces.And one of the clear messages that the President sent directly in the meeting he had and he will continue to convey is that it is now time for them to be in the lead. They are in the lead as we pull our troops back, and we will continue to support them with security assistance and ongoing training. And we have -- continue to have the authorities that we've long had through our withdrawal later this summer. Q: And, separately, do you have an update on Haiti -- the search for the killers of the president there?MS. PSAKI: I don't have a -- an extensive update, I will say, Steve. We continue to be engaged; of course, in touch through a range of channels, but we don't have updates at this point.The Haitian authorities are, of course, leading the investigation, which is, of course, in its early stages. We're ready and willing to support Haitian authorities, but we're going to let the investigation play out.Q: A follow-up on Haiti, please.MS. PSAKI: Go ahead, April.Q: What is this administration doing, in the midst of this assassination, to stand up the Haitian democracy in the midst of this? What is this administration doing? MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I would say that it is still -- it is our view and we continue to call for elections to happen this year. And we believe they should proceed. We know that free and fair elections will facilitate a peaceful transfer of power to a newly elected President, and we certainly continue to support Haiti's democratic institutions. We will call on all political parties, civil society, and stakeholders to work together in the wake of the tragedy and echo acting -- the acting prime minister's call for calm.We have not re- -- offi- -- received an official request for assistance, a formal request, but we stand ready to receive that when it comes in.I've got to move on, April, because we have limited time. Go ahead, Jeff. Go ahead, Jeff.Q: Thanks, Jen. Is this speech this afternoon by the President considered the final word by the White House, at least, as America's longest war draws down? Or does the President plan to mark this in some other way when all of the troops are out?MS. PSAKI: Well, Jeff, I would say that we -- we are -- the President will continue to update the American people, as Commander-in-Chief, why he's making choices to -- that are in our national security interests. Today is an example of that. And today is an opportunity to communicate again why he made the decision he made and communicate again why it's in our interests. So, I'm not going to rule out when -- if he will or won't speak on Afghanistan in the future. In terms of plans for the end -- for our men and women coming back, I don't have anything to preview, but we don't -- we're not going to have a ""Mission Accomplished"" moment in this regard. It's a 20-year war that has not been won militarily. We are proud of the men and women who have served -- incredibly grateful. The President will note that in his remarks today -- how grateful he is for their service and the families who have sacrificed over the last 20 years. And we will continue to press for a political outcome and a political solution. But beyond that, I think we're going to continue to look for ways to communicate why we make the choices we make.Q: You mentioned ""Mission Accomplished."" Has this mission not been accomplished?MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say, we did exactly what we wanted to do. What I was referring to, Jeff, is we're not having a moment of celebration. We're having a moment where we feel is in our national security interests to bring our men and women serving home. And we feel it's in our national security interests for Afghan forces to be in the lead. We did exactly what we intended to do, and certainly that is something, thanks to the leadership of our military, we have achieved. However, there is not benefit, in our view, in continuing to fight this war militarily.Go ahead.Q: Thank you, Jen. If the military withdrawal is 90 percent complete at this point, why wait until August to finish that? Is there an effort to stall because of this situation -- because of the conditions that are worsening?MS. PSAKI: I would say, Rachel, that that is under the purview of the Department of Defense, and they're doing -- bringing our troops home in a way that is -- keeps them safe. We have not had a single casualty, as I -- as, I think, everyone has noted, and we will continue to keep that as our priority. But in terms of the operational timeline, speed is safety, but we also want to manage our withdrawal in a way that protects our service members, makes sure that we are conducting our drawdown in a way that keeps that as the top priority.Q: And just a quick follow-up: Is the administration considering granting visas to vulnerable women in the region, including prominent activists, politicians, or journalists?MS. PSAKI: We maintain a range of contingencies and plan for a range of operational options, but I don't have anything to preview on that front.Go ahead.Q: Jen, thank you. If it turns out that the Afghan forces are not equipped and the Taliban has a complete takeover, would the President consider sending U.S. troops back into Afghanistan?MS. PSAKI: I'm not going to get into a hypothetical.Go ahead. Go ahead.Q: And I had a question on something you briefly mentioned yesterday.MS. PSAKI: Yeah.Q: The President said he would deliver a message to Putin, which he already did last month. So, when he said that yesterday, did he mean he has a new message for Putin? And under what circumstances will he deliver that?MS. PSAKI: I think, in the context of the Q&A, he meant, ""I'm not going to provide to you an update of the briefing I just received."" Q: But he said he had a message to deliver.MS. PSAKI: But that was the context of how he answered that question.Go ahead. Go ahead, Jacqui.Q: Thanks. Thanks, Jen. On ransomware, in terms of the Kaseya hack, does the administration consider this to be an escalation, given that it didn't attack one entity but hundreds of entities? And does the U.S. consider it to be critical infrastructure in any way, given how it hampered transactions for grocery stores and that kind of thing?MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, first, I would say, critical infrastructure, broadly speaking, would perhaps take out an entire se- -- economic sector in the country. But that doesn't mean we don't take every cyberattack, every ransom attack incredibly seriously.And as it relates to the impact here -- or how we're evaluating it, I should say -- there has been an escalation of ransomware attacks over the course of the last several years. It's been a growing -- an escalating problem that even predates President Biden. And it's not just the United States; it's something that's happening around the world. So, we know it's not going to be turned off with a light switch. It's not an up and down. We know that this needs to be ongoing engagement, and we'll have to assess, over 6 months and 12 months, what our success looks like. So that's how we're looking at our impact as it relates to the cyber threats.Q: And then, in the conversation with Russia about, you know, enforcing this red line that the President drew at the summit, what concrete asks have we made of Russia in terms of cracking down on actors that are within that state and clearly are attacking our companies here?MS. PSAKI: Sure. I would say the President hasn't minced words. And should he speak with President Putin again -- to Weijia's question -- he will convey the same message, which is: We -- if you do not take action to crack down on criminal actors in your country, even if the government didn't know, we will. We reserve that option too. And that is -- continues to be his clear message.Q: Is there a timeline, though, on that? Is -- have we given Russia, you know, two weeks to do something? MS. PSAKI: I'm not going to preview that for you all.Q: And I want to go to the meeting yesterday between the Chicago mayor --MS. PSAKI: Sure.Q: -- and the President. Can you talk at all about the request that she made of the administration in order to crack down on crime in that city? There was a report that she requested federal support. Did that involve troop presence in any way? MS. PSAKI: I don't -- I don't have any summary of the conversation in that regard. I don't know if that's something they've read out from their ends. From our end, what the President conveyed to Mayor Lightfoot is that he will continue to work with her, in partnership, and work with cities around the country to address the rise of cri- -- of violence and, specifically, the rise of gun violence was -- is predominantly the driver in Chicago. He also reiterated that, as the Department of Justice had announced just a few weeks ago, Chicago is one of the cities that will be a beneficiary of these groups that will go and help them -- help directly crack down on combating drug violence and drug traffic- -- I mean, sorry, gun violence and gun trafficking -- something that we're doing in about a half a dozen cities across the country. And he also reiterated his continued efforts at the federal level to crack down on the illegal passing of guns.So there has been a great deal of funding that has been provided already to the city of Chicago -- Cook County, specifically -- and certainly some of that can be used to address crime as well.Q: How is the DOJ's strike force going to specifically interrupt the networks that are trafficking these guns?MS. PSAKI: They're work -- going to work directly with the city. They're doing them -- we're doing these strike forces in about five cities around the country, and they want to work directly with them to use legal authorities to crack down on illegal gun trafficking and work in partnership with law enforcement authorities in the cities and add that additional heft and -- and resources.Q: And lastly, is there any push to, you know, fund more efforts to equip police departments? There's -- you know, the White House position was that Republicans defunded police. Obviously, the Biden administration has talked a lot about the budget proposal for the COPS program, but there's been some pressure that the administration hasn't vocally enough talked about this spike in crime. MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say the President gave an entire speech on it and will continue to speak about what he's doing. A big driver of the rise in crime is gun violence -- a personal passion of his for decades. I will say that there are a number of components -- I know you referenced the budget -- but the President called -- called for a $300 million increase in funding for the COPS program. That's up from two hun- -- from $237 million in the last budget passed by President Trump to $537 million. And he also calls for an increase of $753 million over 2021 levels to federal law enforcement agencies. It includes ATF -- the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives. It also includes a $10.2 billion -- an increase of $465 million over 2021 -- enacted for the FBI.Go ahead, Steve.Q: Yeah, back on Haiti, just for a second, Jen.MS. PSAKI: Sure.Q: Are you in a position to describe or detail some of the assistance the U.S. is standing ready to offer Haiti if asked?MS. PSAKI: I think we have to wait to see what their formal request is. And we stand ready to respond rapidly to whatever they -- their needs are on the ground, but they're the best equipped to assess that. Q: Can you describe how the President views security and stability in Haiti vis-a-vis American interests today? I mean, I ask that because there's a clip of the President in 1994, when he was a senator, comparing the situation in Haiti to the then-ongoing Bosnian War, in which he said something to the effect of -- you know, he called it a godawful thing to say, but he said, ""Haiti could sink into the Caribbean Sea or rise 300 feet in the air, and it wouldn't matter to American interests."" Does he stand by that view today, or has he changed his view on Haiti?MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say: First, the fact that he is now sitting as President of the United States -- he issued a statement in his voice yesterday about the horrific killing of the President -- and he has made clear to the administration and administration officials that we are -- stand ready to assist in any way they need, whether it's in the investigation or other federal assistance we can offer from here -- sends you a clear message about his care and concern for the people of Haiti.Go ahead, Kelly. Q: The administration and the President has, in some way, included in the calculus on Afghanistan the American public's view that it's time to bring U.S. forces home. Is the President believing that the American people would be satisfied with Kabul falling, with the threat to women and children there, and with some ill-defined numbers about how many of the Afghan interpreters, translators, support are able to be removed safely from the country? Does the President feel the American people factored those risks into that judgement about bringing troops home?MS. PSAKI: Look, I think at the end of the day, Kelly, the President feels that the American people elected him to serve as Commander-in-Chief, make decisions that are in our national interests. It doesn't mean they're always easy, and it doesn't mean there aren't drawbacks to the decisions that he makes. But he is not going to ask another generation of kids to go and serve in Afghanistan in a war that he does not feel can be won militarily, and that is the core driver of his decision here.Q: On REvil, quickly: You mentioned that it's now the assessment of the administration that they were responsible and that part of their criminal enterprise is working outside of Russia. You mentioned that the U.S. is in touch with high-level Russian entities. Is there also outreach to specific locations where our cyber resources know their actors are at work? Is that happening as well? MS. PSAKI: Well, I used that context because I think it's important for people to understand that even though the cybersecurity community has assessed it was REvil, we know they operate in different parts of the world. So even as we're directing and we're having a conversation largely about Russia's knowledge, we -- as we assess and before we make an official assessment by the United States government, we look at that.But, certainly, as concerns arise, we'd certainly be in touch with countries as relevant.Q: (Inaudible.)MS. PSAKI: Of course, yeah.MS. PSAKI: Go ahead.Q: Jen, thanks. On voting rights, the Supreme Court has upheld the voting laws in Arizona. Democrats don't have the votes to pass the latest voting rights bill. What specifically can the President and the White House do to increase voting access without filibuster reform?MS. PSAKI: Well, first, I would say that, one, there are a number of announcements being made by the Democratic National Committee today -- which is most appropriate for them to address -- that the Vice President will be elevating. You've also seen that we've taken steps from our Department of Justice to use legal action, where relevant and where legal -- where the law allows for, to push back on and take action in states where it is -- where legislation is making it more difficult or where laws are making it more difficult for people to vote. We also believe very much that empowering and engaging activists and creating grassroots movements -- something that the Vice President is continuing to play a very prominent and prevalent role in doing -- is also a part of how we're going to work to fight legislation and fight actions to suppress voters around the country. So, certainly, the President would love to sign a piece of voting rights legislation into law. He is -- looks forward to doing that. But he also knows that there are a number of levers from the federal government that we should continue to use, and he's not waiting to have the legislation on his desk.Q: And one more on the Olympics. You know, fans have been banned from attending the Summer Games. Is it your assessment this is still safe for U.S. athletes? And has there been a determination on whether the First Lady will be attending?MS. PSAKI: Sure, well, I would say the President supports the Tokyo Olympic Games and the public health measures necessary to protect athletes, staff, and spectators. He has pride in the U.S. athletes who have trained for the Tokyo Games and will be competing in the best traditions of the Olympic spirit. The government of Japan has stressed that public health remains a central priority as they host the Games -- or they prepare to host the Games. And we've stayed in close contact with the Japanese government throughout the planning process and on related public health measures. So we're well aware of the careful preparations, including the public health measures necessary to protect athletes, staff, and spectators that the government and international committee has undertaken, which is why, as we've said, we support the Games moving forward.In terms of the First Lady, we're still assessing the feasibility of the First Lady attending. And our advance team arrives in Tokyo later this week.Q: Jen, can you clarify one point, please? Just one --MS. PSAKI: Sure.Q: -- on Afghanistan. And I guess it's off of Kelly's question. But you said that you all met many times and there was a decision process in drawing down the -- our presence in Afghanistan. Yes? That's the --MS. PSAKI: That we met many times?Q: Yes.MS. PSAKI: I'm not sure what you mean by that.Q: Yes, that -- well, you have discussed this; there is a plan in place. So, the question naturally is whether or not, at the end of the day, you're accepting the fact or the possibility that the Taliban could indeed take over Afghanistan?MS. PSAKI: Well, Brian, I, again, will refer you to intelligence assessments and the fact that the President asked for a cleared-eye assessment -- a clear-eyed assessment at the beginning of this process.Q: So --MS. PSAKI: And what I can convey to you clearly is why he made the decision. That's also what he'll be delivering an entire speech on --Q: But --MS. PSAKI: -- just this afternoon. Okay, we got to go on. Go ahead, Mike.Q: Again, Afghanistan.MS. PSAKI: Sure. Q: You and I and a lot of the people in this room will remember early 2009, when the Vice President, you know, expressed his -- his opposition to the way that that war was being conducted and his efforts to try to pull back then. He largely hasn't changed his position over the time -- if anything, gotten more opposed to it.I guess, at the end of the day, does the President think this war was worth it? And will he tell the American people that today, whether he -- what he thinks about the worth of having conducted this two-decade war?MS. PSAKI: Well, I think what you can hear -- what you'll hear the President talk about today is one, of course, that he is proud of the men and women who served, and he is grateful to the sacrifices that have been made over the last 20 years.He will also reiterate, as I've talked about a little bit, the fact that he believes the United States did what we went to Afghanistan to do: get the terrorists attacked -- who attacked us on 9/11, deliver justice to Osama bin Laden, root out the terrorist threat so that Afghanistan can never be used as a base from which to attack the United States and our allies.And he also will talk about what he's done -- what we've done, as a country, to help prepare and assist and provide security assistance and humanitarian assistance to the military in Afghanistan, but also to the people of Afghanistan. But we'll -- what you'll also hear him say -- which I think is important for the American people to hear -- is that there would have been significant consequences had we chosen not to bring our troops home. In April, if he had instead announced that the U.S. -- the United States was going back on this agreement made -- the U.S. and allied forces remaining in Afghanistan for the foreseeable future -- the Taliban would have begun to target our forces. The status quo was not an option. Those are difficult decisions you make as Commander-in-Chief. So, you are right. His view has been, for a decade or more consistently, that he does not feel this is a military -- a war that can be won militarily. He does still believe and support the people of Afghanistan, the future of the government of Afghanistan. He supports a political process -- something that our ambassador is continuing to engage in. And he will continue to provide and advocate for providing -- and he could make this decision as President -- humanitarian and security assistance to the people there. So it's -- this is not a speech that is going to give a grade. This is a speech that's going to explain clearly to the American people why he made the decision, what the consequences would have been, what assistance we're going to continue to provide, how we're going to help the brave interpreters and translators who served alongside our forces, and also what the counterterrorism factors are here, including the changing threat from Afghanistan, but including the need to take our CT resources -- counterterrorism resources -- and put them in parts of the world where we have the largest threat. That is no longer Afghanistan. That is other parts of the world, whether it is, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, North Africa. That is where al Qaeda and ISIS is greater, and that's where, as Commander-in-Chief, he needs to put our resources.Q: But -- but fair to say he -- fair to say that he thinks this should have been done a decade ago?MS. PSAKI: I think his view has -- is well publicly known. But again, he has made the decision because he is now President and he assessed what is in our national security interests. Go ahead.Q: Yeah, shifting gears to a different topic: A USA Today investigation published yesterday revealed that the FBI played a role in locating Princess Latifa of Dubai just before a yacht was raided in the Indian Ocean in 2018. The capture of the princess has outraged human rights activists, given the accounts that she was trying to flee her father's oppressive rule. Two questions: Was the FBI assistance appropriate? And does it raise concerns that the assistance, even if provided unwittingly, forced Latifa's return to the family she sought to flee?MS. PSAKI: I understand your question. I'm certainly -- I'm just not going to have anything to offer you from here, so I'd refer you to the FBI.Q: And one other question. Multiple media outlets, including Politico and ABC, reported yesterday that the White House is seeking to have bi- -- have the bipartisan infrastructure plan on the Senate floor as early as next week. Can you confirm that timeline as being the one sought by the White House right now? MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, as Leader Schumer has said, he wants to move on both the bipartisan plan and the budget reconciliation resolution -- or we're now calling the Build Back Better plan -- during the upcoming July/August Senate session. So our understanding is that the process could begin as early as the week of July 19th, given that committees are still finalizing legislative text for both the budget resolution and the bipartisan bill. We, of course, support and would like to see it move forward as quickly as possible, but it would be a mistake to think of July 19th as anything more than the opening of a window, not a deadline.Go ahead.Q: Thanks, Jen. Two questions. One, Al Sharpton said earlier this morning that he and other civil rights leaders would press President Biden to do more than just put boots on the ground for voting rights --MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.Q: -- that he'd pushed for a legislative solution and one that works through or around the filibuster. What does the President plan to say in response? MS. PSAKI: Well -- well, we'll wait for the meeting to take place and then they'll come out to the stakeout. But I will tell you the President agrees that a federal legislation is an important part of protecting voting rights and people's right to vote, which is a fundamental right in this country. He agrees with that. He also believes there's a range of levers that can be used from the federal government concurrently and that he's not going to wait either, even as federal legislation -- even as we're determining what the path forward looks like. But we'll see how the meeting goes, and certainly that will be the -- a central topic. Q: One more question.MS. PSAKI: Sure.Q: Does the White House wonder that -- worry that elevating voting rights to a Democratic issue -- a Democratic platform issue will give Republicans more fodder to make partisan attacks against voting rights? MS. PSAKI: No.Go ahead.Q: If I could piggyback off Michael's question.MS. PSAKI: Sure.Q: With the benefit of hindsight, does the President feel that the war with Afghanistan was worth it? MS. PSAKI: Again, I think it's important for people to know -- understand that as President of the United States, he's not here to give grades. He's here to provide context to the American people on why he made the decision he made to bring men and women home from serving; why it's in our national interest, our counterterrorism interest, and the interest of our -- of our positions around the world. I understand why you all are asking the question, but I think this issue, the complexity of this issue over 20 years deserves more context than that. Q: And one quick follow-up. Will there or are there consequences for the Taliban in terms of just the encroachments that they have been making in the country?MS. PSAKI: Consequences from the United States? Well, I would say that right now what we're supporting is a political process and one where we are hopeful that that can move forward to have a more lasting solution and bring peace and prosperity to the country over the long term. Q: And so that means engaging with the Taliban as sort of (inaudible)?MS. PSAKI: Well, as you know, we have an ambassador who is engaging -- or playing a role in these negotiations. Ultimately, it's, of course, between the Afghans and members of the Taliban, but we are engaged and supportive of those political -- that political process.Go ahead. Oh, go ahead, Nancy.Q: Oh, thanks. Shortly after the company DiDi was listed on the New York Stock Exchange, China blocked the app, resulting in it plummeting in value and American investors losing money. Does this concern the President? And more broadly, does the President agree that regulators should block companies that do not adhere to U.S. auditing regulations from IPOs? MS. PSAKI: Well, I'm not going to speak -- comment on this specific company from here or speak to actions that could be taken independently by the SEC. Broadly, the U.S. will continue to ensure we remain the destination of choice for investors and companies seeking investments around the world, and always protecting Americans' data and our national security. We do think it's essential that all companies that list in the U.S. adhere to high standards of transparency and disclosure, and welcome companies that meet those standards. But beyond that, I'm not going to have additional --Q: Just one more question, Jen.MS. PSAKI: Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, Nancy.Q: On COVID: When will the White House make a decision on reopening travel to certain nations? And what will it be based on? Will it be based on vaccine thresholds, or is there a certain country that you want to open travel to first? MS. PSAKI: Well, as you know, Nancy, there are working groups that are currently engaged and in touch about the criteria that will need to be met in order to reopen. We certainly understand and know that this is a point of frustration for a lot of people around the world, including people who are separated from their family members. And we put these working groups together so they could work together directly to assess what the criteria should be on when the travel can be reopened. Go ahead.Q: Is the United States now recognizing Claude Joseph as the leader of Haiti? MS. PSAKI: We recognize the democratic institutions of Haiti, and we are going to continue to work with them directly. But we have long call- -- we have been calling for elections this year, and we support those proceeding.Q: Do you think that those elections should be delayed from September?MS. PSAKI: We believe they should proceed this year.Q: Has the President reached out to the interim prime minister? Has he reached out or does he plan to reach out?MS. PSAKI: I don't have any calls that -- he has not reached out. I don't have any calls to preview for you, no. Go ahead. Go ahead, Rachel. Q: The President's reference to door-to-door campaigns for vaccines sparked kind of a backlash. You know, Missouri's governor is saying he doesn't want that. The Republican lawmakers saying, basically, ""Stay off our lawns."" Can you say who is doing the door knocking and where?MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, let me first say that this has been ongoing since April, and the best people to talk about vaccinations are local, trusted messengers: doctors, faith leaders, community leaders --Do you have something, April, you want to share with the group? (Laughs.) Okay.So, those are the people who are the trusted messengers around the country. And we believe that we need to empower these individuals to continue to work in communities to make sure people know that these vaccines are safe, that they can save lives. And so these are grassroots voices across the country. They are not members of the government. They are not federal government employees. They are volunteers. They are clergy. They are trusted voices in communities who are playing this role and door knocking. And this is one of the tactics that we've used over the last couple of months, but we've seen -- so, it's not the only factor -- but I would say that we've seen, in some states -- Alabama: the adult vaccination rate increased by 3.9 percent; 149,000 additional adults got their first dose in June.In Florida, the adult vaccination rate increased by 4.4 -- 4.4 percent. In Georgia, the adult vaccination rate increased by 3.5 percent. So, in our view, this is a -- this is a way to engage and empower local activists, trusted members of the community.Q: So, the follow-up would be: Is it working? And who are -- who are these volunteers reaching other than, say, shut-ins? Because people don't even have to get off their couches to see who's at their door these days. MS. PSAKI: Well, that's fair -- depending on the technology in your house, I guess, I suppose. But I think what's important for people to know -- and I appreciate you asking the question -- is that the federal government does not have a database of who's been vaccinated. That is not our role. We don't maintain a database along those lines, and we have no plans to.We do know where there are rates of vaccination across the country, and we know -- as I just listed in some of the data -- that there are tactics that are powerful and impactful. And so, I will say, the thing that is a bit frustrating to us is that when -- when people are critical of these tactics, it's really a disservice to the country and to the doctors, faith leaders, community leaders, and others who are working to get people vaccinated. This is about saving lives and ending this pandemic. Go ahead. Q: Was that me? MS. PSAKI: Oh, go ahead, Yamiche. Yeah, go ahead. I'm sorry. And then I'll go to you, right in front of her. Go ahead, Yamiche.Q: So my -- I have two questions. The first is: You've said over and over again that the United States believes elections should happen in Haiti this year.MS. PSAKI: Yeah.Q: People in Haiti are so scared they can't leave their homes; they can't go to the grocery store. How does the United States think elections can happen when people are too afraid to even go to their front doors? MS. PSAKI: Well, Yamiche, first, we understand and see the trauma that obviously the horrific killing of just thirty- --Q: It's happening for months. So, yes?MS. PSAKI: I understand that. I didn't say anything otherwise. But I'm saying what's happened over the last 36 hours. We, again, stand ready to provide support, provide assistance in any way that is formally requested by the government there. We're -- we're looking forward to hearing from them on what they would request and how we can help them through this period of time. And we called for an election this year -- or we're continuing to call for one because we feel that supporting democratic institutions, the democratic process, is something that would be in the interest of the people of Haiti. That's why we're advocating for it. We stand by to provide assistance, to provide help in any way possible, as we long have, even before yesterday.Q: And the people of Haiti, including human rights activists, clergy members on the ground, they've been saying over and over again for months now that elections aren't possible. I've talked to people specifically who say that they're disappointed in the President's stance on Haiti, that they see him as continuing failed policies that go back to his predecessor, former President Trump. What's the President's response to Haitians who say they are disappointed in him and they don't think that he's really listening to their cries, which are saying that elections cannot happen? MS. PSAKI: I would say that the message to the people of Haiti is: We stand with you. We want to provide assistance, whether that is assistance requested by the government or assistance that is needed for the people of the country to prosper in the future. And that is the President's view. Go ahead.Q: Is the President --Q: Jen --MS. PSAKI: Go ahead. We're going to have to keep going. Go ahead. Go ahead. Go ahead.Q: Yeah, right now, on Haiti -- right now --MS. PSAKI: Oh, I'm sorry. I'll come back to you, I apologize. Go ahead. Q: Yeah, right now there are two politicians who are claiming, in Haiti, the role of prime minister: Claude Joseph and Ariel Henry. How does the U.S. think that this impasse should be resolved? And are you worried that it could lead to further instability? MS. PSAKI: Well, first, we continue to support Haiti's democratic institutions. And we have been in touch with the acting prime minister, and we echo his call for calm. But I would again reiterate that's one of the reasons we have called for elections this year, and we believe that they should proceed. Of course, we are worried about and closely monitoring the security situation, the stability in Haiti, and understand that -- even before yesterday, but certainly as a result of yesterday -- that is even more of a concern for the people who are living in the country. Q: But right now, you are not backing any one of the two?MS. PSAKI: We are calling -- we support the institutions, and we are continuing to call for elections this year.Go ahead, Monica.Q: Jen, on voting rights: The President indicated he may tour the nation and talk about that, give a major speech on the topic. That hasn't happened yet. Should we expect it still to take place? Or what can you tell us about that? MS. PSAKI: Sure. Well, I would say, first, that the President felt it was important to meet directly with civil rights leaders and talk to them about how we can work together to continue to push for federal legislation, continue to use every lever in the federal government to make voting more accessible across the country. But certainly, he conveyed he wants to speak to the country about voting rights and how he's going to address it moving forward.I don't have any scheduling updates for you today, but he certainly plans to continue -- continues to plan to do that, I should say.Q: That's still the plan. Okay.MS. PSAKI: Yep. Q: Jen --MS. PSAKI: Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead, go ahead. I apologize. Thank you. Q: Thank you. There are hurt feelings among government officials in Taipei after the White House COVID team posted and then deleted a tweet that had an image of Taiwan's flag along those of other nations getting vaccine doses from the United States. Was this tweet a mistake in the first place? And if not, then why was the tweet deleted? MS. PSAKI: So, this was an honest mistake that was made by the team handling graphics and social media, and should not in any way be viewed as a shift in official U.S. policy. When we recognized the mistake, we removed the tweet. So we did exactly as you said.We remain committed to our One-China Policy based on the Taiwan Relations Act, the three joint communiques, and the six assurances.Go ahead, in the middle. Go ahead, Eugene. Go ahead.Q: Thanks, Jen. It seems pretty clear on --MS. PSAKI: And you just got engaged, I think. Q: I did.MS. PSAKI: Random aside. But congratulations. (Applause.) Yes. We're just a lot of news you can use in here. (Laughter.)Q: It seems pretty clear that, on voting rights, a legislative fix isn't going to happen, right? Like, the Republicans have made it clear they're probably not going to get on board; you're not going to get 10 votes. And the President has talked about being open to filibuster reform if it's used, kind of, too much. And, I guess, advocates keep asking us to ask you guys: What does that look like? Is there a time period? Because we're -- they feel like they're running out of time, that they're not seeing a lot of urgency on the President's part. MS. PSAKI: Well, I would say the President is meeting with civil rights leaders today because he feels there is urgency on determining how we can most effectively work together to move voting rights forward -- access to voting rights, I guess I should say, forward. And he's an optimist by nature; otherwise, he wouldn't be President of the United States. So he continues to believe that there should be a pathway forward for federal legislation. He did say, as you just quoted, he has made comments in that regard. And certainly obstruction and the fact that there is an unwillingness to move forward in making voting more accessible to people across the country is something that he's mindful of and he believes and has said -- and we have said before -- could change the conversation in the Senate. We'll see what happens, but he will continue to press for federal legislation moving forward. Q: (Inaudible) one more.MS. PSAKI: Oh, yeah, go ahead.Q: I've talked to Reverend Sharpton quite a bit, and one thing that he is really interested in seeing and hearing from the President is a carve-out for voting rights and police reform for the filibuster. Is that something that the White House is going to be pushing for? Is the President calling Joe Manchin and other holdouts on filibuster reform?MS. PSAKI: The President's position hasn't changed. We certainly understand the position of Reverend Sharpton and others. And the President, though, shares their desire, commitment, interest in moving forward on voting rights legislation and moving forward on initiatives across the country that can help make voting more accessible to people across the country. I'm sure they will have a robust discussion today.Go ahead.Q: I have a question about the executive order --MS. PSAKI: Sure.Q: -- on non-compete mandates. MS. PSAKI: Yep.Q: Businesses use those mandates because it helps protect their investment in employees; it also helps protect their intellectual property. So will there be any kind of carve-out or anything in this executive order to protect businesses? And what is the White House message to businesses that are concerned about this executive order?MS. PSAKI: Well, I'm happy to follow up with our team and see if there's anything specifically to your very good question. I will say that the overarching objective with the executive order is to make sure the President is encouraging competition in industries around the country. It doesn't sound right to most people that there are three shipping companies that are dominating the market, and upping and increasing costs for suppliers, small businesses, people across the country. That doesn't sound right or fair, because it isn't. So that's what the President is trying to address.In terms of the specific carve-out you're asking about, I'm happy to ask our team if there's anything more.Go ahead.Q: Thank you, Jen. Just on voting rights: Vice President Harris, as we speak, is announcing a $25 million expansion of the DNC's --MS. PSAKI: Yep.Q: -- ""I Will Vote"" initiative. This is just one of the examples that voter -- that Democratic committees are launching in terms of voter protection. Can you speak about the White House's collaboration with these committees on the strategy?MS. PSAKI: Well, again, I referred specifically to the DNC because it's most appropriate for them. I know the Vice President is making this speech to -- but to outline the specific details given they're the political arm here, so they can get into all the specific details.But it's just an example of how every lever of the Democratic Party and the federal government is working and looking for ways that we can make voting more accessible around the country. But they'd be the most appropriate entity to outline details. Q: But is the White House specifically involved? Were they aware of this strategy? I mean, what was the collaboration between the two?MS. PSAKI: Yes, we're aware of it. But again, they're the political arm, so they're the most appropriate body to outline details.Go ahead. Q: Hi, Jen. Thanks. I wanted to ask you about the global tax negotiations. I know that Secretary Yellen is supposed to be in Italy tomorrow about it.MS. PSAKI: Mm-hmm.Q: Can the White House credibly guarantee to its counterparties in that agreement that you can get something through the Senate and the U.S. will actually be able to enact the legislation that the deal requires?MS. PSAKI: Well, that's something we've proposed and we're going to continue to press on. And this agreement wouldn't be the case -- wouldn't be happening without the leadership of the United States, of Secretary Yellen and others in the government. So certainly, it is very much our desire, our interest, and our commitment to deliver on that promise. I think you're going to have to gather in a moment here. Go ahead. One more. One more. Q: Thank you, Jen. You may have seen yesterday the former President filed a class-action lawsuit against three social media companies, and one of the targets as part of that lawsuit is Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. He would like to see that particular aspect of the law ruled unconstitutional.In January of last year, Joe Biden, when he was running for President, spoke to the New York Times, and he said Section 230 should be revoked -- revoked immediately. Does he stand by the comments that he made to the New York Times last year?MS. PSAKI: I have not spoken with him about Section 230. I remember those comments, and I remember the New York Times article. I'm happy to venture to do exactly that. I will say that, as it relates to these lawsuits, it's certainly a decision for the platforms to make. I think it's safe to say that the President spends a lot less time obsessing over social media than the former President. With that, thank you, everyone. Happy birthday, Steve!MSTRUCK-7536693 MSTRUCK",White House Issues Transcript of News Briefing By Press Secretary Psaki on July 8
498,"(TNSRep) -- The U.S. Department of Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics - New England Regional Information Office issued the following report on Feb. 18, 2022, entitled ""Union Members in Massachusetts - 2021"":In 2021, union members accounted for 12.6 percent of wage and salary workers in Massachusetts, compared with 12.0 percent in 2020, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Regional Commissioner William J. Sibley noted that the union membership rate for the state was at its peak in 1989 and 1990, when it averaged 17.5 percent, and at its low point in 2019 and 2020 at 12.0 percent. (See chart 1 and table A.) Nationwide, union members accounted for 10.3 percent of employed wage and salary workers in 2021. The rate was down from 10.8 percent in 2020 when the rate increased due to a decline in the total number of nonunion workers compared with the decline in the number of union members.The 2021 unionization rate for the nation was the same as the 2019 rate of 10.3 percent. Since 1989, when state data became available, union membership rates in Massachusetts have been above the U.S average.Massachusetts had 402,000 union members in 2021. In addition to these members, another 31,000 wage and salary workers in Massachusetts were represented by a union or covered by an employee association or contract while not union members themselves.Nationwide, 14.0 million wage and salary workers were union members in 2021 and 1.8 million wage and salary workers were not affiliated with a union but had jobs covered by a union contract. The number of wage and salary workers belonging to unions (14.0 million) was down by 241,000 from 2020.In 2021, 30 states and the District of Columbia had union membership rates below that of the U.S. average, 10.3 percent, while 20 states had rates above it. (See table 1.) Ten states had union membership rates below 5.0 percent in 2021. South Carolina had the lowest rate (1.7 percent), followed by North Carolina (2.6 percent) and Utah (3.5 percent). Two states had union membership rates over 20.0 percent in 2021: Hawaii (22.4 percent) and New York (22.2 percent). (See chart 2.)Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic Impact on 2021 Union Members DataUnion membership data for 2021 continue to reflect the impact on the labor market of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Comparisons with union membership measures for 2020, including metrics such as the union membership rate, should be interpreted with caution. The onset of the pandemic in 2020 led to an increase in the unionization rate for the nation due to a disproportionately large decline in the number of nonunion workers compared with the decline in the number of union members. The decrease in the national rate in 2021 reflects a large gain in the number of nonunion workers and a decrease in the number of union workers. More information on labor market developments in recent months is available at www.bls.gov/covid19/effects-of-covid-19-pandemic-and-response-on-the-employment-situation-news-release.htm.Technical NoteThe estimates in this release are obtained from the Current Population Survey (CPS), which provides basic information on the labor force, employment, and unemployment. The survey is conducted monthly for the Bureau of Labor Statistics by the U.S. Census Bureau from a scientifically selected national sample of about 60,000 eligible households. The union membership data are tabulated from one-quarter of the CPS monthly sample and are limited to wage and salary workers. All self-employed workers are excluded. Beginning in January of each year, data reflect revised population controls used in the CPS. Additional information about population controls is available on the BLS website at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#pop.Information about the reliability of data from the CPS and guidance on estimating standard errors is available at www.bls.gov/cps/documentation.htm#reliability.DefinitionsThe principal definitions used in this release are described briefly below.Union members. Data refer to members of a labor union or an employee association similar to a union.Union membership rate.

499,"Publication: The Breeze, , James Madison University , Harrisonburg, VAFuturistic worlds accessed through goggles with graphics nearly indistinguishable from the real world are growing closer by the day as virtual reality , augmented reality and mixed reality gain steam.
VR is an immersive digital experience that creates a completely virtual environment. AR is data and computer-generated images that are integrated into a user’s natural environment. MR blends elements of both, creating seamless transitions between virtual and real environments.
Millions eager to safely escape quarantine early in the pandemic discovered VR, AR and MR, though today’s world already has heaps of mixed reality mixed in. 
Faces take digital form through Snapchat filters that blend digital images with the shape of a user’s face, while a Google search for a pug from an Android phone will digitally render what looks and sounds like an actual-size 3D pug into your space. Anyone who’s ever played Pokémon GO has already adventured into an AR world. Mixed reality has seemingly boundless potential, with applications in education and industry. 


Opinion | VR is paving the way for future gaming developments
VR gaming is the way of the future, creating not just fun experiences for gamers, but educational experiences for students.
The pandemic appears to be illuminating opportunities for enterprises to train better, and these improvements won’t just disappear after the pandemic ends. Innovations catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic won’t just go away when some people start returning to work. According to an analysis by KPMG, the majority of innovations spurred by the pandemic are here to stay. 
“We’ve seen a huge uptick of commercial interest in both virtual and augmented reality driven by the pandemic,” Tom Mainelli, VP of devices and consumer research at IDC, said, adding that organizations of all sizes are leveraging the technology to train new employees, streamline manufacturing processes and increase collaboration among workers. 
The AR/VR industry is expected to accelerate out of the pandemic, with total mixed reality spending ballooning from $12.0 billion in 2020 to $72.8 billion in 2024 comprising a 54% five-year compound annual growth rate.
“I think we’ve seen three to four years of progress in just three to four months, in terms of acceptance of what the new world needs to look like,” Steve Hasker, CEO of Thomson Reuters, said to KPMG.  
Companies look to capitalize as trend becomes reality
Big tech companies aren’t missing the opportunity to build on mixed reality — the genre of tech made up of AR and VR products — though it might not have been in time for the pandemic. 
Facebook owns the Oculus brand of virtual reality gaming headsets, which it bought for $2 billion from the controversial tech entrepreneur Palmer Luckey in 2014. The company also has plans to launch smart glasses in 2021, though they won’t quite be AR. Instead, they’ll be simpler, more along the lines of Snapchat Spectacles — regular sunglasses with an integrated camera lens for filming and taking pictures — with longer term plans to deliver an AR product.


‘Fake news,’ privacy, VR, AI: A look at what’s next for tech
A crystal ball is yet to be invented, but it could be by 2030. Until then, ""fake news,"" data privacy, virtual reality and artificial intelligence to bound to rise, for better or worse.
Apple is anticipated to launch a set of glasses that have both virtual and augmented reality capabilities — where digital images are spliced in with your view of the natural world — sometime before 2022. Apple originally planned to release a headset in 2018, but like other tech companies, it pushed the project back due to internal disputes over the design of the product. 
Lots of companies have tried to roll out AR or VR glasses for everyday consumers, but it seems like these products are either too clunky, too expensive or lack the functionality needed to be adopted by the general public. Google launched the Google Glass in 2014 then pivoted the product to sell to enterprises. Examples abound of similar retoolings.
A lot of advancements are being made to mixed reality tech which are solving the problems of functionality, clunkiness and price for widespread consumer adoption. Here’s how these three design problems may be solved in the next few years. 
Function, not just form
First, the problem of functionality. Users are less likely to adopt a new product if it doesn’t improve on older tech or satisfy a need. Another of Apple’s revolutionary rollouts, the Apple Watch, lacks functionality when the wearer isn’t connected to the internet or near an iPhone. The same problem could plague users of Apple mixed reality glasses in remote areas.
“[Typical mixed reality] glasses can’t hold a computer,"" Wolen, who remains personally and professionally engaged with mixed reality, said. “Most of the functionality of the glasses will be computed in the cloud, and that relies on the cell service that you have. Depending on where you are you might get really slow updates, or the glasses might not even work,” Wolen said. 
With the advent of fifth-generation mobile networks, or 5G, internet speeds might improve enough to connect apps within a mixed reality headset quickly enough while navigating cities, which will make them more useful for consumers and increase their functionality.
Facebook has a goal of 10,000 active Oculus Quest units, which Zuckerberg argued will inspire independent developers to create games that are compatible with the console, another means of boosting functionality. 
Slimming down to reach mainstream
The clunkiness problem is one that must be solved before many mainstream consumers shell out hundreds of dollars for a VR, AR or MR headset.

Apple originally started working on a super high-performance set of goggles that had both AR and VR functionality that required a stationary “hub” about the size of a small Mac computer that’d communicate with the glasses through a wireless signal. 
Apple execs settled on a new design that ditches the hub — losing some functionality — but still offers a “cinematic” sound system and graphics that are “indistinguishable from reality,” according to Bloomberg. 
“Apple is really good at keeping things sleek, clean and simple, so if they’re making glasses, they know that they need to look good so that someone will wear them all the time,” Wolen said. “... It will be interesting to see how Apple targets customers and how they showcase what these glasses are really capable of. And then from there, we might see other companies mimic what [Apple] is doing.”
Is the price right?
Finally, the price needs to be right for the average consumer. Prices are dropping for the Facebook Oculus Quest. The Quest 2 retails for $299 — that’s $100 cheaper than Oculus 1, which was released just a year before and boasts improved functionality. 
The Oculus Quest 2 was released in October with preorders topping those of the original Oculus Quest, Mark Zuckerberg said during a Q3 earnings call in 2020. 
If Apple’s launch is successful, competitors will likely follow suit and roll out mixed-reality products for everyday consumers, which will result in a lowered price point. It all depends on if Apple’s launch appeals to the general public. 
Apple’s brand recognition and focus on aesthetics may help with the price and adoption of VR by the masses.
JMU grad sounds off on the future of VR
While the real world reels with the uncertainties of inflation, disease and climate change, virtual realities, and even virtual worlds, are becoming more of a possibility. 
Skylar Wolen (’18) founded JMU’s AR/VR class as an undergrad and is now a consultant at Deloitte. Wolen first got interested in the tech when he helped develop a VR exposure therapy treatment app built with Oculus development kits 1 and 2, which facilitate the creation of software that’s compatible with an Oculus headset. 


JMU incorporates virtual reality across campus through X-Labs
JMU has further integrated virtual reality into campus since its introduction in 2016. Students can use the program in X-Labs to make their own products and become trained in different fields.
Wolen’s team earned two prizes at the second annual Bluestone Hackathon in 2016 by designing a virtual reality app that immersed a person in a simulation that exposes them to their fear. One of the hackathon’s judges was afraid of heights and started crying after entering the simulation on a mountain, Wolen said. He’s optimistic about virtual reality’s uses.
“It is pretty exciting,” Wolen said. “It’s different, you know? It’s nothing we’ve really seen before. It’s new and I always like new things, and I like to push the limit on what we’re really capable of.” 
Tech futurists say virtual worlds, or “the Metaverse,” like Ernest Cline’s OASIS from the novel “Ready Player One,” could become a reality within as few as five years. “Digital twins” are virtual copies of real cities that you’d use a set of VR goggles and haptic gloves to access.
“Imagine taking New York City and all of it’s buildings and all of its information and uploading it and having that as a virtual reality world,” Wolen said. “I’m hoping in the next five to 10 years we’ll start to see movement into this area.""
In Cline’s novel, humans use a virtual world to escape the messes they make in the real world, ditching a planet plagued by disease and poverty for a sunny and green virtual reality. In light of recent events triggered by social media, it’s not difficult to find examples of technology exposing the negative sides of humanity. On the other hand, it’s easy to imagine a virtual world as a good place where simulated cancer research can occur, or lonely people can find social interaction. 
Notwithstanding, many tech futurists agree it can be irrelevant to make a call on whether a new tech will pose a net benefit or downfall to humanity. 
“What I see with technology is it always goes both ways,” Wolen said. “There’s always a positive and there’s always a negative. If you leave it up to us we usually bring out the worst in things, but I hope for a positive.”

",Ready Player One? Virtual reality growing past the pandemic
500,"Editor's note: After the Editorial Board called on Sen. Ron Johnson to either resign or be expelled from office for his role in spreading disinformation about the presidential election, the senator asked for space to respond. We are providing him that courtesy today. We also are taking the rare step of footnoting Johnson's commentary to provide additional context so that readers have a fuller understanding of the senator's actions.
In an unhinged and uninformed editorial, the Journal Sentinel called for my resignation or expulsion from the U.S. Senate. Among its many baseless charges, it accuses me of ""inciting violence and an act of domestic terrorism,"" being ""a leading member of the Senate Sedition Caucus,"" ""stoking an insurrection,"" ""violating my solemn oaths,"" being a racist (they must have overlooked my involvement with Milwaukee's Joseph Project) and ""shilling for Trump"" (apparently along with 74 million other Americans who voted for him).1
All this because I did half of what Democrat Sen. Barbara Boxer did in 2005 when she objected to Ohio's electors, forcing a two-hour debate.2 Unlike Senator Boxer — who to my knowledge was never asked to resign or be expelled — I did not vote to sustain the objection.3 When asked by the Associated Press immediately afterward why I voted no, I responded, ""We needed to have the debate, but we also need to respect the rule of law and our constitutional constraints.""
Does that sound like incitement or a violation of my oath?
Far from ""stoking an insurrection,"" an honest examination of my actions would show me attempting to defuse growing passions. Ever since the Electoral College met, I have acknowledged that former Vice President Joe Biden is the president-elect and repeatedly said I could not envision any scenario where Biden electors would be rejected. Supporting the first objection gave me a voice in negotiations to bring about an honest but not endless debate.4
But we needed to have the debate. A growing belief5 that votes to disallow electors would be based on one vote per state — where Republicans have an advantage — instead of involving every member, had to be proven false. It is also important to acknowledge — instead of scornfully dismissing — the legitimate concerns of tens of millions of Americans and to recognize that it is not sustainable that so many have lost faith in our institutions and the fairness of our electoral process.6
Those who have lost confidence are not crazy. They are citizens who dearly love America and are alarmed by what they witnessed over the last four years: political opponents decrying a duly elected president as illegitimate and participating in a resistance to him; a thoroughly corrupt FBI investigation of that duly elected president;7 a grossly biased media8 that chose a side and used its power to interfere in our politics to a far greater extent than any foreign entity could ever hope to achieve; an increasingly powerful social media that censors news and conservative voices;9 and courts and election officials that usurp the constitutional authority of state legislatures in setting the times, places and manner of holding elections.
They were reminded of the Carter-Baker Commission's caution regarding absentee balloting: ""Absentee ballots remain the largest source of potential voter fraud."" Then they saw COVID-19 exploited to dramatically increase absentee voting — and simultaneous extensive efforts to weaken the controls governing it.10 They heard that Facebook's CEO spent almost half a billion dollars to increase Democrat turnout in Democrat-controlled jurisdictions, and they wonder, ""Is that even legal?""11
Then on Election Day, they saw poll watchers being thrown out or obstructed from observing.
They heard credible allegations of voting fraud that they know are too rarely investigated or prosecuted,12 of large Democrat-controlled counties dumping their vote totals in the wee hours of the morning only after Republican counties have reported,13  election officials and others refusing to turn over evidence to those investigating irregularities, and courts refusing to hear what evidence was obtained and instead dismissing election challenges on procedural grounds.14
The Journal Sentinel is wrong to imply these citizens would shut up and forget their concerns if only elected Republicans tell them to.15 This is not a problem that can be swept aside with the hope it will somehow solve itself. I recognized this early and held a hearing in December, but was only able to scratch the surface of the issues involved. Witnesses testified under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury, but the Journal Sentinel calls it ""bogus."" My opening statement in no way can be viewed as an incitement. Unless election irregularities are fully investigated and explanations provided, I fear this problem will fester and could lead to even greater rancor and division.16
I hoped this debate would serve as a wake-up call to state legislatures to recognize the legitimacy of these concerns, fully investigate the irregularities in their states, reassert their authority over federal elections, and establish controls to restore confidence in our election system. The solution lies in the states, not with the federal government. For the future unity of our nation, it is crucial that states properly shoulder their responsibility, take the action required, and alleviate any doubt that future elections will be fair and legitimate.17
There is no justification for the violence that occurred at the Capitol. I condemned it then and I condemn it now. I also offer my sincere condolences to the loved ones of those who died. But unlike many in the media and on the left, I am consistent in my condemnation of ""peaceful protests"" that become violent. Where is the media condemnation of Democrats who have actually promoted violence over the last four years and, prior to the election, told President-elect Biden never to concede?18
Prior to publishing its partisan screed, the Journal Sentinel could have reviewed the public record and investigated the validity of its baseless and incendiary allegations against me. Casually and wrongly using terms like ""insurrection,"" ""incitement,"" ""sedition"" and ""domestic terrorism"" might feel good when putting pen to paper, but when the state's largest ""news"" publication does it, it simply confirms what a large percentage of Americans already believe: The mainstream media have dropped all pretense of objectivity and can no longer be trusted. It's well past time for the media to look in the mirror and acknowledge the role their bias has played in widening our national divide and exacerbating the problem.19
Annotations
1. Sen. Ron Johnson took an oath to support and defend the Constitution of the United States. In our system, the states certify Electoral College votes and Congress acknowledges the victor. Senators and representatives cannot overturn the will of citizen voters by rejecting a state's electoral votes.
As for racism: Underlying the attack on the U.S. Capitol was a ""tribal fury against people targeted as scapegoats,"" we wrote, a fury President Donald Trump stoked repeatedly during his time in office. Johnson showed he was a willing accomplice in this shameful politics by repeatedly failing to adequately call out Trump's appeals to the worst prejudices in people.
2. Although one senator, Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., challenged the results in Ohio after the 2004 presidential election, the situation was radically different from 2020. Boxer stood alone in the Senate that year, and fellow Democrats distanced themselves from her actions. She was not supported by the Democratic candidate for president, Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts. In fact, Kerry followed normal protocol for U.S. presidential elections and called President George W. Bush to concede and congratulate him on Nov. 3, the morning after the votes were counted. Unlike Trump, Kerry never questioned the overall integrity of the election.
3. Johnson only voted against objections to Joe Biden's victories in Arizona and Pennsylvania after the deadly sacking of the U.S. Capitol had interrupted Congress' tallying of the Electoral College vote on Jan. 6. Up to the insurrection, Johnson had publicly stated he would vote in favor of challenges to the state-certified votes. Originally, those challenges were to include Wisconsin's tallies.
Worse, like Trump, Johnson spent weeks questioning the validity of the election without citing any evidence. That included holding a one-sided hearing that allowed Trump's lawyers to once again air allegations of fraud that had already been rejected by dozens of courtrooms across America, including both Republican and Democratic judges and even federal judges appointed by Trump.
Johnson's role in spreading and amplifying lies about the election — including his threat to challenge the ceremonial counting of electoral votes in Congress — encouraged Trump supporters to believe the result could be overturned, and that helped lead to the tragedy at the Capitol.
In an interview broadcast Monday night, William Barr, Trump's former attorney general, said that doubts raised about the legitimacy of the Nov. 3 election ""precipitated the riot"" at the Capitol.
And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., on Tuesday blamed Trump and other leaders. ""The mob was fed lies. They were provoked by the president and other powerful people and they tried to use fear and violence,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.
In our view, those ""powerful people"" include Senator Johnson.
4. Despite filing more than 60 court cases, Trump and his supporters could find no evidence of fraud or ""irregularities"" that would have changed the result. They lost case after case. Senator Johnson should have acknowledged Biden's victory immediately and repeatedly as Trump spread lies and challenged the election like no president in history, of any party, has ever done. Instead of ""attempting to defuse growing passions,"" Johnson did the opposite. After working on bills to ensure a smooth and peaceful transition of power at the end of the Obama administration, Johnson did a complete flip when Trump lost. Asked a week after the election if he had congratulated Joe Biden, Johnson snapped: ""Nothing to congratulate him about."" His decision to ""investigate"" the election results gave more life to conspiracy theories designed to mislead and stir resentment.
5. And where did this ""growing belief"" come from? Not from reporting by independent, fact-based news organizations. It came from interest groups and politicians who were careless with facts in their support of Trump.
6. Why have some Trump supporters lost faith in the fairness of the electoral process? It is precisely because irresponsible politicians like Trump and Johnson, aided by reckless allies at right-wing propaganda outlets, continually called those election results into question.
7. This is a Johnson hobby horse, again parroting inaccurate claims by Trump. A Department of Justice inspector general in Trump's own administration found in 2019 that while the FBI had ""serious performance failures"" in its investigation of Russian influence in the 2016 election, there was ample reason for an investigation and political bias didn't drive it. In an August report, the Senate Intelligence Committee, under Republican leadership, found numerous contacts between Trump's campaign and the Russians and said Moscow posed a ""grave"" threat.
8. Like Trump, Johnson frequently claims ""media bias"" to divert attention from his own failures. America's founders established a free and independent press precisely so politicians in power could not control the information citizens receive. The Journal Sentinel and its partner wire services would have reported the exact same way if a Democratic incumbent had been defeated by a Republican challenger and refused to accept the will of the voters.
9.This is a fallacy. Despite the alleged liberal bias of social media companies like Facebook and Twitter, an analysis by Politico in October found that Trump and his supporters have dominated those spaces, with right-wing social commentary being shared sometimes as much as 10 times more often than posts by liberals and Democrats. The companies banned Trump only after the Jan. 6 uprising — for violating policies against inciting violence, which all users agree to in advance.
10. This didn't happen in Wisconsin. Many people voted absentee but they did it under existing rules. More Wisconsin voters were allowed to vote absentee without showing photo identification in counties Trump won than in counties that backed Joe Biden.
11. This issue was raised in lawsuits in Wisconsin. Judges found the practice was legal.
12. The way to challenge election results under the rule of law in America is through the courts and judicial branch. Senator Johnson and President Trump have not produced evidence of any wrongdoing that would change the outcome. No court has found the accusations of fraud credible.
13. This is misleading. Votes were not ""dumped."" They were counted. This took a long time in Wisconsin because state law prevents ballots from being counted prior to Election Day. Johnson is well aware of this: Before the election, he called for the law to be changed. Everyone knew it would take time to open envelopes, check ballots against registration lists and put them through the machines, especially in population centers. Republican and Democratic observers were present the entire time and the process was broadcast over the internet for all who wanted to watch it.
14. Conservatives have long argued for tight rules over who has ""standing"" to sue in many types of cases. Election rules in Wisconsin were adjusted and reviewed by a Republican-led government and were not challenged in past elections.
15. How about telling the truth? Instead of spreading the lie that the election wasn't valid, Johnson should have done as Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, suggested in a speech the night the Capitol was sacked. ""The best way we can show respect for the voters who are upset is by telling them the truth. ... The truth is that President-elect Biden won this election. President Trump lost.""
16. By encouraging the lie about election ""irregularities"" and by acting as if Congress could overturn the results and negate the certified ballots of millions of Americans, it is Johnson who has done more than most to foment ""rancor and division."" As U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher of Green Bay put it in a commentary for USA TODAY: ""The objectors were giving millions of people false hope that somehow Congress or Vice President Mike Pence could change the outcome of the election. This was, of course, a lie."" That lie helped lead to the insurrection at the Capitol as election results were formally accepted by Congress.
17. Federal officials, including Trump's Attorney General William Barr, vouched for the integrity of the election. On Nov. 12, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency — part of Trump's own administration — and two other groups said: ""The November 3rd election was the most secure in American history. ... There is no evidence that any voting system deleted or lost votes, changed votes, or was in any way compromised."" Hand recounts of paper ballots in jurisdictions, such as Georgia, only confirmed the results. The same was true in two Wisconsin counties.
18. Blame the media and act like a victim of bias — a classic propaganda tactic to divert attention from the facts in question. Johnson links to a foreign news organization quoting Hillary Clinton to support his claim. (Clinton, who won the popular vote but lost the electoral vote by the same margin that Trump lost to Biden, called Trump to concede and congratulate him the morning after the 2016 election). Johnson also links to a conservative site that uses quotes about unrest out of context.
19. This is a page right out of the Trump playbook — blame the ""mainstream media"" when you don't have an answer. The Editorial Board will defend the right of the citizens to choose their elected officials — government of the people, by the people, for the people — even if Senator Johnson will not.

Thousands in D.C. cite Religion
Mandate met with flurry of health-care holdouts
Nearly 2,500 D.C. health-care workers remain unvaccinated following Thursday's deadline to receive at least the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, with nearly 70 percent of them requesting a religious exemption, according to city officials.
D.C. government and health-care employees in the city are subject to different vaccination mandates announced by the administration of Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) in August. While most of the city's 37,000 government workers may undergo weekly testing instead of vaccination, the tens of thousands of licensed and unlicensed health-care workers in the District were instructed to get the first dose of a vaccine by Thursday, under a separate mandate that does not allow a testing option.
The overwhelming majority of government and health-care workers in the District who have reported their vaccination status say they've gotten at least one shot, but District lawmakers have homed in on the city's Fire and EMS Department, whose employees are among a relatively small group of government workers who are subject to the stricter requirements for health-care workers.
About 267 of the department's more than 2,000 employees have sought exemption from getting vaccinated, according to city officials - with the vast majority of them citing their religion. The 20 requests that have been reviewed so far were denied.
""To hear from the city administrator that we had an outsized number of religious exemption requests from one agency caught my attention,"" said D.C. Council member Christina Henderson (I-At Large). ""Across the country, we believe in religious freedoms. But I think there is a high skepticism of individuals using religion for religion's sake, as a shield to avoid something they don't want to do.""
Not including Fire/EMS personnel, there are about 82,000 licensed health-care workers who are required to get vaccinated as part of the city's mandate, according to the mayor's office. Of the 51,000 or so licensed employees who had reported their vaccination status as of Friday morning, about 49,000 said they were partially or fully vaccinated. Seventy-five percent of the 1,640 licensed health-care workers who reported being unvaccinated are seeking a religious exemption.
More than 12,000 of the roughly 13,000 unlicensed health-care workers who reported their status to the city said they were partially or fully vaccinated; 62 percent of the 823 unlicensed personnel who reported being unvaccinated are requesting a religious exemption.
Firefighters who are against the vaccine mandate say the exemption requests are a reflection of genuine expressions of faith that, for many, have grounded them during the difficulties of the pandemic. They also responded to safety concerns by citing unvaccinated firefighters' adherence to the current weekly testing option, with the need to show a negative result to assume duty.
""For many of us, they have spiritual beliefs that are connected to what they do with their body,"" said Will Jones, 31, a third-generation Washingtonian who began his firefighting career five years ago with the department. Jones, who is one of the organizers of the DC Firefighters Bodily Autonomy Affirmation Group, which was created after the mandate was announced, said he was worried about unvaccinated firefighters losing their jobs.
""It would be a nightmare continuing to do what we're supposed to do in the city with losing a couple hundred firefighters,"" Jones said. ""It's not anti-vaccine as much as it is, 'What is the ethical way to move forward with this?' in order to continue to protect and serve the city.""
Group members represent a ""whole spectrum of spiritual beliefs,"" including Christian, Jewish and Muslim members, Jones said.
Norman Brooks, 37, a firefighter who has served for about 15 years and is a member of the group, said the mandate is a ""violation of people's basic rights.""
""As far as my beliefs go, there are certain scriptures that pretty much speak to letting God handle the situation,"" Brooks said. ""I believe people should get the vaccine if that's what they believe is best for them, but as far as for me, my beliefs, it's not for me.""
In a statement, the group says it has obtained legal counsel should the religious exemptions be denied.
By Thursday afternoon, 89 percent of all D.C. government employees had reported their vaccination status, with 75 percent confirming they were fully vaccinated, said City Administrator Kevin Donahue. He said the majority of exemptions have come from Fire/EMS because it is the largest employer within D.C. government that is subject to the stricter mandate for health-care workers.
Asked at a news conference last month about how D.C. would confront challenges with staffing that could arise because of the vaccine requirements, Bowser emphasized that her priority was public safety.
""Our Fire and EMS workers are in very precarious situations, they go into people's homes, they provide health care in the back of an ambulance, they live together,"" Bowser said. ""We see the extension of this mandate for our health-care workers, especially our D.C. government employees, as a way to keep our communities safe.""
In neighboring jurisdictions like Montgomery County and Alexandria, officials say government employees will be offered a test-out option, and they are not tracking exemption requests at this point - although Montgomery is considering eliminating the option to test out.
There are some other licensed health professionals who work in D.C. government, such as nurses and physical therapists in schools, who must also be vaccinated or get an exemption. In mid-September, Bowser announced that all teachers, school staff and early child-care workers in the District must be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus by Nov. 1, eliminating a testing option for that population as well.
Now that the Sept. 30 deadline for health-care workers has passed, D.C. Health will begin reviewing documentation and proof of vaccination for all workers covered by the mandate, including Fire/EMS workers, Donahue said. Health-care employees could ultimately lose their licenses if they remain unvaccinated without an exemption, while Fire/EMS workers could be suspended or terminated.
Donahue said each exemption request is reviewed on a case-by-case basis, and those who cite a spiritual belief must meet a threshold of whether it's deeply held that qualifies for a reasonable accommodation not to get vaccinated. Those who disagree with the decision can appeal and in the meantime, they'll be subject to weekly testing.
D.C.'s religious accommodation request form notes that a request could be denied if it creates an ""undue hardship"" on the agency. It also specifies that these requests cannot be based on political, sociological, philosophical or moral beliefs.
Henderson said her concerns were largely fueled by the fact that Fire/EMS personnel live in close quarters where they probably interact without personal protective equipment. She envisioned a scenario where an entire firehouse could be shut down, or severely stymied, because of an outbreak.
In response to safety concerns, Jones pointed to the weekly testing requirement.
""We've been serving safely and courageously throughout this pandemic,"" Jones said. ""We are currently testing. People are providing negative tests before they're assuming duty.""
On a call between the D.C. Council and members of Bowser's administration Friday morning, several council members continued to ask about vaccine exemptions, including Elissa Silverman (I-At Large), who questioned whether the Department of Health would consider removing religious exemptions from vaccine policies altogether.
The volume of requests, she said could suggest ""there might be some abuse or some loose interpretation of the religious exemption.""
City officials say they understand the desire of vaccine-hesitant firefighters to continue serving the community, and Donahue said he hoped the result would be a fully vaccinated workforce.
""The goal of all this is not to suspend or fire any workers, the goal is to get them vaccinated,"" Donahue said. ""And hopefully, the inevitable, impending requirement of getting vaccinated will provide further incentive for those holding out to get a vaccine.""

508,"The Maine House Democrats issued the following news release:Rep. Seth Berry's bill to ban misleading winter electricity disconnection threats as part of the collections process was signed into law Thursday.The bill, LD 1328, will prevent electric utilities from issuing misleading disconnection notices during the winter, a practice that has affected thousands of Mainers. The Public Utilities Commission (PUC) already does not allow residential winter disconnections, but did allow untruthful collections notices that convey specific winter dates on which the customer's power will be shut off. According to testimony submitted by the PUC, in the winter of 2019-2020, CMP issued 109,573 such disconnection notices, and Versant issued 66,884. Numbers for 2020 and 2021 were not yet available.Under the new law, utilities will now be fined up to $2,500 per violation for sending false winter disconnection notices.""Poverty, a global pandemic, and loss of income in many households, plus the crippling impact of a PUC decision to summarily dismiss thousands of CMP billing disputes, left many customers with balances over three and four thousand dollars,"" said Berry, D-Bowdoinham, House chair of the Energy, Utilities and Technology Committee. ""It is unconscionable that CMP and Versant were allowed to lie and to bully customers with 175,000 empty threats of winter disconnection in 2019 alone. But now this dishonest practice is coming to an end.""After the bills public hearing on April 14, Berry said the bill would end CMP's ""shameless and dishonest harassment of customers"" during the winter months.Nicole Batchelder of Leeds said in written testimony that she received one of the disconnection notices in question in December of 2020, shortly before Christmas, and that she felt she was being bullied at a time when she was already struggling.""We understand we need to pay the bills, somehow, someday, but the disconnection notices will not make the money magically grow on trees in our backyards,"" wrote Batchelder. ""The only thing the threatening winter disconnect notices accomplish during these turbulent times is additional, unneeded stress."" Sen. Joseph Baldacci, D-Bangor, was the lead co-sponsor of LD 1328 in the Maine Senate.""This is an important bill for thousands of Maine families struggling each winter. Having electricity for your home in the winter is the difference between safety and comfort, and frozen pipes, frigid rooms and being able to safely take care of one's family. Power companies are barred from cutting off power to homes during the winter, but before this bill they were still allowed to send misleading and downright threatening letters. That is outrageous and really unacceptable. I was proud to co-sponsor this bill to put an end to this abusive practice,"" said Baldacci.The new law does not cover the disconnection process outside of the winter months. Such disconnections had been prohibited due to COVID-19 but are now eligible to resume.Berry's measure will go into effect 90 days after the Legislatures special session adjourns.Berry represents House District 55: Bowdoin, Bowdoinham, Swan Island and most of Richmond. He previously served from 2006-2014, the final two years as House majority leader, and returned to the House in 2016.Baldacci has been practicing law for 29 years. He is a resident of Bangor, has served four terms on the Bangor city Council and was elected Council Chair and Mayor twice. He has represented Maine families and small businesses in his small private practice in downtown Bangor. This is his first term representing Bangor and Hermon in the Maine Senate.MSTRUCK-7526294 MSTRUCK",Maine House Democrats: Berry Bill to Stop Winter Disconnection Threats Signed Into Law

OTTAWA, ON, June 14, 2021 /CNW/ - The Canadian District of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America is pleased to announce $2.4M funding from the Government of Canada to support the ""UBC Diversity and Inclusion in Apprenticeship"" project. Funded in part by the Government of Canada's Union Training and Innovation Program, the project is designed to create a more equitable, diverse, and inclusive apprenticeship system for underrepresented populations within Red Seal trades across Canada.Our industry has become more diverse, and we continue to recruit more women, indigenous persons, and minority populations.  We must implement a workforce development model to address the cultural challenges that limit apprenticeship outcomes.""The need for education and systemic changes to improve the inclusion and integration of diverse populations within the construction industry is essential to improve worker safety, increase productivity, and accelerate innovation and economic growth,"" says Canadian District Vice President Jason Rowe.  ""Our industry has become more diverse, and we continue to recruit more women, indigenous persons, and minority populations.  We must implement a workforce development model to address the cultural challenges that limit apprenticeship outcomes."" 
""As we continue to fight COVID-19, our support for workers remains strong. Skilled tradespeople across the country have been critical to essential sectors during this pandemic, and they will continue to be so as Canada continues to recover. This investment will help Canadians, including Canadians from key groups facing barriers, get the training they need to launch exciting and well-paying careers in the trades."" 
– Minister of Employment, Workforce Development and Disability Inclusion, Carla Qualtrough
Over this five-year project, the UBC will:Create a National Standards Guideline to guide curriculum and program development of ""Diversity and Inclusion"" training programs for the trades to increase the employment and retention of diverse populations in the workplace; Develop and implement a Mentorship program for the Carpenter, Cabinet Maker, Floorcovering Installer, Lather (Interior Systems Mechanic), Industrial Mechanic (Millwright), Machinist, Roofer, Insulator, and Welder trades, with an emphasis on improving diversity and inclusion in the industry; and Develop a National Recognition Program for Diversity and Inclusion to recognize and champion excellence demonstrated by Journeypersons, Apprentices, and Employers towards improving diversity and inclusion in the construction industry.A National Steering Committee consisting of representatives from all diverse populations across Canada will create standards and guidelines for diversity and inclusion training. The creation of these standards will enhance the quality and consistency of training programs nationwide and guide the construction industry on what needs to be implemented to ensure true diversity and inclusion in the workplace.  Bev Young, Training Director for the UBC Canadian District, says, ""Standards and codes of practice guide our apprentices' programs; we live by them every day.  The time has come where we must expand our standards to ensure our training and work practices are consistent nationwide and is inclusive of the needs of the diverse populations we represent."" 
Creating national standards for diversity and inclusion will form the basis for enhancing UBC's Mentorship program.  It will provide the UBC and the construction industry with the capacity to build the leadership skills for Journeypersons and improve the environment to support the Apprentice.  ""Incorporating diversity and inclusiveness into a Mentorship model would further improve working relations between Journeypersons and Apprentices and improve the overall culture and mutual respect in the workplace, leading to greater outcomes for all apprentices,"" says Rowe.
Although the UBC recognizes that significant work has been done across the country to improve the workplace culture within the construction industry, this project will increase public awareness of the benefits of supporting a diverse and inclusive workforce. It will publicly champion individuals and employers whose efforts make an outstanding contribution to the industry.  A National Recognition Program for Diversity and Inclusion will be established to motivate and challenge more workers and employers to make a combined effort to create an inclusive environment that is welcoming to diverse populations.  Rowe says, ""this initiative will not only be complementary to the great initiatives already in place nationwide, but will spark a conversation and directive for stronger Inclusion and Diversity action plans within apprenticeship trades.""

518,"A series of studies found that the Moderna vaccine seemed to be more protective as the months passed than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Here's why.It was a constant refrain from federal health officials after the coronavirus vaccines were authorized: These shots are all equally effective.That has turned out not to be true.Roughly 221 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine have been dispensed thus far in the United States, compared with about 150 million doses of Moderna's vaccine. In a half-dozen studies published over the past few weeks, Moderna's vaccine appeared to be more protective than the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in the months after immunization.The latest such study, published on Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, evaluated the real-world effectiveness of the vaccines at preventing symptomatic illness in about 5,000 health care workers in 25 states. The study found that the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine had an effectiveness of 88.8 percent, compared with Moderna's 96.3 percent.Research published on Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the efficacy of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against hospitalization fell from 91 percent to 77 percent after a four-month period following the second shot. The Moderna vaccine showed no decline over the same period.If the efficacy gap continues to widen, it may have implications for the debate on booster shots. Federal agencies this week are evaluating the need for a third shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for some high-risk groups, including older adults.Scientists who were initially skeptical of the reported differences between the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines have slowly become convinced that the disparity is small but real.""Our baseline assumption is that the mRNA vaccines are functioning similarly, but then you start to see a separation,"" said Natalie Dean, a biostatistician at Emory University in Atlanta. ""It's not a huge difference, but at least it's consistent.""But the discrepancy is small and the real-world consequences uncertain, because both vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization, she and others cautioned.""Yes, likely a real difference, probably reflecting what's in the two vials,"" said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York. ""But truly, how much does this difference matter in the real world?""""It's not appropriate for people who took Pfizer to be freaking out that they got an inferior vaccine.""Even in the original clinical trials of the three vaccines eventually authorized in the United States -- made by Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson -- it was clear that the J.&J. vaccine had a lower efficacy than the other two. Research since then has borne out that trend, although J.&J. announced this week that a second dose of its vaccine boosts its efficacy to levels comparable to the others.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines rely on the same mRNA platform, and in the initial clinical trials, they had remarkably similar efficacy against symptomatic infection: 95 percent for Pfizer-BioNTech and 94 percent for Moderna. This was in part why they were described as more or less equivalent.The subtleties emerged over time. The vaccines have never been directly compared in a carefully designed study, so the data indicating that effects vary are based mostly on observations.Results from those studies can be skewed by any number of factors, including the location, the age of the population vaccinated, when they were immunized and the timing between the doses, Dr. Dean said.For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was rolled out weeks before Moderna's to priority groups -- older adults and health care workers. Immunity wanes more quickly in older adults, so a decline observed in a group consisting mostly of older adults may give the false impression that the protection from the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine falls off quickly.Given those caveats, ""I'm not convinced that there truly is a difference,"" said Dr. Bill Gruber, a senior vice president at Pfizer. ""I don't think there's sufficient data out there to make that claim.""But by now, the observational studies have delivered results from a number of locations -- Qatar, the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, several other states in the United States -- and in health care workers, hospitalized veterans or the general population.Moderna's efficacy against severe illness in those studies ranged from 92 to 100 percent. Pfizer-BioNTech's numbers trailed by 10 to 15 percentage points.The two vaccines have diverged more sharply in their efficacy against infection. Protection from both waned over time, particularly after the arrival of the Delta variant, but the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine's values fell lower. In two of the recent studies, the Moderna vaccine did better at preventing illness by more than 30 percentage points.A few studies found that the levels of antibodies produced by the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine were one-third to one-half those produced by the Moderna vaccine. Yet that decrease is trivial, Dr. Moore said: For comparison, there is a more than 100-fold difference in the antibody levels among healthy individuals.Still, other experts said that the corpus of evidence pointed to a disparity that would be worth exploring, at least in people who respond weakly to vaccines, including older adults and immunocompromised people.""At the end of the day, I do think there are subtle but real differences between Moderna and Pfizer,"" Dr. Jeffrey Wilson, an immunologist and physician at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville who was a co-author of one such study, published in JAMA Network Open this month. ""In high-risk populations, it might be relevant. It'd be good if people took a close look.""""Pfizer is a big hammer,"" Dr. Wilson added, but ""Moderna is a sledgehammer.""Several factors might underlie the divergence. The vaccines differ in their dosing and in the time between the first and second doses.Vaccine manufacturers would typically have enough time to test a range of doses before choosing one -- and they have done such testing for their trials of the coronavirus vaccine in children.But in the midst of a pandemic last year, the companies had to guess at the optimal dose. Pfizer went with 30 micrograms, Moderna with 100.Moderna's vaccine relies on a lipid nanoparticle that can deliver the larger dose. And the first and second shots of that vaccine are staggered by four weeks, compared with three for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.The extra week may give immune cells more time to proliferate before the second dose, said Dr. Paul Burton, Moderna's chief medical officer. ""We need to keep studying this and to do more research, but I think it's plausible.""Moderna's team recently showed that a half dose of the vaccine still sent antibody levels soaring. Based on those data, the company asked the F.D.A. this month to authorize 50 micrograms, the half dose, as a booster shot.There is limited evidence showing the effect of that dose, and none on how long the higher antibody levels might last. Federal regulators are reviewing Moderna's data to determine whether the available data are sufficient to authorize a booster shot of the half dose.Ultimately, both vaccines are still holding steady against severe illness and hospitalization, especially in people under 65, Dr. Moore said.Scientists had initially hoped that the vaccines would have an efficacy of 50 or 60 percent. ""We would have all seen that as great result and been happy with it,"" he said. ""Fast forward to now, and we're debating whether 96.3 percent vaccine efficacy for Moderna versus 88.8 percent for Pfizer is a big deal.""Both vaccines are still highly effective at preventing severe illness and hospitalization, experts said.

519,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, Aug. 21 -- Fifty-one dentists have issued a public comment on the Food and Drug Administration notice entitled ""Conveying Materials Information About Medical Devices to Patients Healthcare Providers-Considerations for a Framework"". The comment was posted on Aug. 19, 2021:* * *We, the undersigned dentists, dental hygienists, and other health professionals, appreciate FDA's safety communication, patient brochure, and infographics that describe its new recommendations against amalgam use in seven categories of high-risk populations. Now we urge FDA to take further steps to convey information about amalgam's mercury and its risks to patients and healthcare professionals - and ultimately end all use of this toxic filling material.As mercury-free healthcare professionals, we know that mercury products are not safe and that amalgam is not needed for any dental treatment. We firmly believe that all patients also have the right to know about the risks of amalgam's mercury and about the mercury-free alternatives that can better protect their oral health.Based on our experience, we recommend that FDA develop the following materials to convey information to patients and their healthcare providers:1. Checklist of talking points about dental amalgam: Many dentists and other healthcare specialists (like pediatricians, obstetricians, nephrologists, and neurologists) are uncomfortable discussing amalgam's mercury with their patients and their patients' parents. A checklist of key talking points dentists and other health professionals should review with patients - including at least the fact that amalgam is approximately 50% mercury, FDA recommends against amalgam use in high risk populations, and mercury-free fillings are available - would facilitate these discussions.2. Consent form requiring patient signature: Many dentists who use amalgam do not tell patients about amalgam's mercury and the alternatives, which often leads to complaints, distrust in the dentist-patient relationship, and delays of future dental treatment. A sample consent form - based on FDA's new recommendations - with a line for patient or parent signature would encourage dentists to obtain informed consent before implanting amalgam in a patient.3. Guidance for amalgam manufacturers: Many dentists and other healthcare specialists missed the announcement of FDA's new amalgam recommendations because of the focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. Guidance for amalgam manufacturers - telling them to distribute FDA's patient brochure, dentist-patient discussion checklist, and consent form requiring patient signature - would help ensure that these materials reach dentists and ultimately their patients.Thank you for your attention to this important issue.Sincerely,Gary Larsen, DDS, Clovis CAWilliam Domb, DMD, Upland, CARobert P.

521,"Ty Gibbs is giving his grandfather plenty to think about. The 18-year-old grandson of championship car owner Joe Gibbs took the lead with 20 laps left at Charlotte Motor Speedway and held off the field for his second Xfinity Series win of his rookie season Saturday in Concord, N.C. If the younger Gibbs keeps this up, Joe Gibbs might not be able to keep the hard-charging young driver out of the NASCAR Cup Series. “You're getting me all excited now,” Ty Gibbs said. “I think about a lot of stuff all the time, processing stuff. I definitely think about that.” It might be a tight squeeze since Joe Gibbs Racing currently fields four teams, all with championship drive in past series champs Kyle Busch and Martin Truex Jr., along with Denny Hamlin and Christopher Bell. “They belong there,” Gibbs said. “I'm still trying to figure it out.” Gibbs had won the Daytona road course event in February with a late pass through a grassy area. This time, Gibbs overcame a spin at the end of the second stage and kept his patience until the end when he came out on top of a side-by-side duel with NASCAR Cup Series racer Chase Briscoe, who lost control and surrendered the lead to Gibbs. Reigning Xfinity Series champ Austin Cindric was second, followed by Harrison Burton, Brandon Brown, and Tyler Reddick. Briscoe finished sixth . . . Four drivers for Hendrick Motorsports will start among the top seven at the Coca-Cola 600 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday. Kyle Larson captured the pole, while Chase Elliott and William Byron qualified third and fourth, respectively. Hendrick's other driver, Alex Bowman, will start seventh. A win from any of those four would be No. 269 for Hendrick Motorsports, pushing the team past Petty Enterprises for the most Cup Series wins in NASCAR history. Ticket restrictions have been lifted for the race and COVID-19 vaccinations are not required.HOCKEYUS drops Norway at WorldsTage Thompson had a goal and an assist and the United States won its fourth straight game in the world championships, beating Norway, 2-1, in Riga, Latvia. Jake Oettinger made 22 saves and Conor Garland also scored. The Americans are second in Group B, a point behind Finland — which beat the Americans in the opener — with two games left. The top four teams in each group will advance to the quarterfinals. Finland beat fourth-place Germany, 2-1, with Arttu Ruotsalainen breaking a tie midway through the third period. Also in Group B, Roman Starchenko had two goals and three assists in Kazakhstan's 11-3 victory over Italy. Russia and Slovakia each won to remain tied for the Group A lead. Sergei Tolchinski had a goal and an assist in a third-period burst in Russia's 4-1 victory over Switzerland, and Julius Hudacek made 24 saves in Slovakia's 2-0 victory over Denmark.TENNISDjokovic tunes up with Belgrade championshipNovak Djokovic warmed up for the French Open by beating Alex Molcan, 6-4, 6-3, to take his 83rd career title on home soil at the Belgrade Open. Top-ranked Djokovic struggled on serve in the first set as he was broken three times by his Slovakian opponent. Djokovic was also broken once in the second set by Molcan, the 255th-ranked qualifier playing his first tour-level final, but was reliably able to dominate Molcan's serve for a total six breaks in the match. Djokovic is drawn against Tennys Sandgren in the first round at Roland Garros . . . Sebastian Korda, 20, won his first ATP trophy with a straight-set victory over Italian wild card Marco Cecchinato at the Emilia-Romagna Open in Parma, Italy. Korda became the first American in 11 years to lift a trophy on European clay, since Sam Querrey won in Belgrade in 2010. Korda had not dropped a set all week in Parma and he carried on that run in the final to see off the 104th-ranked Cecchinato, 6-2, 6-4, in 75 minutes. Korda had lost the only other final he had contested, against Hubert Hurkacz at the Delray Beach Open in January. Korda's father is former second-ranked Petr Korda.

529,"SANTA BARBARA, Calif., Nov. 10, 2021 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- In what was their most successful virtual fundraising event to date, Santa Barbara-based international disaster relief organization ShelterBox USA raised more than $600,000 at their annual virtual benefit ""An Evening to Experience ShelterBox"" held November 4, 2021. More than 350 people attended the live-streamed event which was broadcast internationally from the ShelterBox USA headquarters in Santa Barbara, CA. 
""We are inspired by the incredible support from across Santa Barbara and the nation from people wanting to help families displaced by disaster and crisis situations,"" said Kerri Murray, President of ShelterBox USA. ""For many of the guests participating in the live-streamed event, it was their first time learning about the global humanitarian relief efforts of ShelterBox. We are humbled by the generosity and outpouring of charitable support for this lifesaving mission.""
The immersive experience into disaster response work of ShelterBox featured a virtual tour of the ShelterBox family relief tent, which a family up to ten will live in for a period of weeks to months after losing their home in an emergency. In addition to the tent demonstration, the organization highlighted the critical tools and supplies they provide to set up a household in an emergency, including water purification, solar lanterns, cooking equipment and critically needed hygiene supplies to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
ShelterBox Response Team (SRT) members who have responded to disasters around the world shared deployment stories of the impact ShelterBox aid has on the lives of people who have lost everything after disaster, including in the aftermath of the 7.2 magnitude earthquake that rocked Haiti in August 2021. 
The evening's festivities ramped up when a generous donor spontaneously announced a matching gift of $250,000 if the original goal of $250,000 was reached by the end of the event. In total and with the support of hundreds of individuals, Rotarians, and Foundation support, the night raised more than $600,000 to provide up to 6,000 displaced families with the life-saving emergency shelter and household supplies needed to survive after disaster.
During the event, ShelterBox honored the Dale and Edna Walsh (DEW) Foundation with the 2021 Global Humanitarian Service Award for their extraordinary philanthropic efforts to tackle some of the biggest issues facing the world. This includes the DEW Foundation's longtime support of ShelterBox and its work in the Syrian refugee crisis. In 2020, DEW Foundation provided hundreds of displaced Syrian families with shelter and basic household items including shelter kits, blankets, and winter clothing to help them survive the cold winter months.

531,"As island getaways continue to be on hold for most because of COVID-19, the best we can do is replace yesteryear's packed suitcase with today's at-home homage. Translation: tropical decor is as hot on the design scene as the Caribbean sun.  Before you flock to design stores for all things flamingo, there are a few things to consider. This bold look can push the limits. With all the colorful commotion those lush islands impart on the senses, too much can definitely be too much when it's contained in your home.
To get a design expert's, ahem, eye on the situation, we asked Bobby Berk, Emmy-nominated TV host of Netflix hit series ""Queer Eye,"" to take home decor on a little vacation.
Beyond palm tree wallpaper or a splash of Sherwin Williams Coral Reef (both of which also do the trick), Berk's expert tips elevate the tropical look and guarantee the paper umbrella in your at-home Mai-Tai isn't the only thing causing a stir.
1. Focus on elements
that bring you joy
Should you want to dip your toes in trend waters first, start small by limiting your island vibe in a powder room, sunroom, or extra bedroom. Berk's own guest room in his California home is the wanderlust vacation escape we all wish we could take right now, with lush plants, natural textiles, and bare wood elements.
Just as the mere scent of coconut can bring thoughts to a sandy beach and skin slathered in SPF, there are certain details that conjure up island life.
Swaying palm trees, crystal blue waters, birds posing pink and pretty – these are the elements of a tropical paradise.
With a keen eye and a discerning taste, decide which elements bring you the most joy and work from there.
2. Play with natural fibers
An oasis of sun and sand is all about nature, so natural textures are clear go-tos.
Berk says, ""Any natural woven material like bamboo, rattan, or palm is the perfect way to add island vibes.""
These along with raw wood, cane, sea grass, and jute are soothing in their neutral tones and act well to balance out any bright colors you plan to add. They can also easily be incorporated anywhere, from window treatments to rugs, dining room chairs to beds. Just don't go overboard.
Berk warns, ""Stick to one or two large pieces, like a rattan coffee table, bamboo blinds, or a woven palm mirror to avoid a space that looks just a little too much like a tiki bar.""
Against the natural hues is the perfect place to play with color, perhaps combining woven textures like rattan chairs or tables with fun fabrics in vibrant colors and patterns for a tropical pop.
3. Mix in plants
One of the main draws to paradise is its lush flora. Recreate a touch of that greenery by introducing a few key pieces of foliage to your home with palm trees and leaves. You can replant them into raffia baskets to double-up on the details. If you're not in a climate that supports those plants, go faux.
""Adding a vase with faux palm fronds or a faux palm plant is an easy way to add a tropical touch that won't need watering,"" Berk says, recommending the bathroom as a great locale. In truth, this simple accent really works almost anywhere.
He also suggests sticking to three to five stems for a balanced arrangement within your tropical oasis.
Or, forgo the plants for a little pillow talk. He explains, ""Pillows that feature fun foliage will make you feel like you're on an island escape.""
Stick to larger-scale patterns and prints that feature one or two colors to keep things from getting too busy.
""You can also include solid color pillows in sunset-inspired colors to help balance out the patterns,"" says Berk.
4. Set a tropical tone with lights
The tropical sun may be miles away, but you can still brighten up your decor with the right lighting fixtures.
For indoors, look for lamps or pendants made from natural elements, such as raffia or rattan, rope (warning: this can easily lean nautical), oyster shells or capiz shells, or go all out with lamps that mimic some of nature's beautiful shapes.
""When you add lights or tiki torches outside your home, they immediately set a tone sure to encourage fun and lighthearted conversation,"" says Berk. ""We love this accent outside or near a patio area for a summer ambiance we all crave.""
5. Fill up on fruit
Use your decor as an opportunity to not only inspire tropical vibes but to encourage healthy eating habits.
Berk says, ""Big bowls [filled] with fruit can embody a tropical feel and island love.""
So get your creative juices flowing and pack the space with fruits beyond the obvious banana: Papayas, mangos, kiwis, even dragon fruit, create a feast for the eyes.
""All the bright, bold colors in a beautiful bowl in the center of your dining table can make for an easy tropical feel that functions as decor,"" Berk says.
6. Reimagine your own
tropical memories
Sometimes all it takes is a fun print to send you straight to the tropics.
Try adding a few pieces of art that depict tropical scenes or a seaside landscape. And, don't forget your own personal beach snaps.
""Including places that you've traveled or feel inspired by will also make it more personal,"" Berk adds. ""It's a great way to transport yourself without leaving home.""

532,"Publication: The Oracle, , SUNY College at New Paltz, New Paltz, NYClasses were canceled and a plethora of activities were offered to students on the very first Mind, Body and Spirit Day to focus on students’ wellness and mindfulness. Photo by Zoe Woolrich.
Following the SUNY-wide decision to cancel spring break due to COVID-19, New Paltz has decided to create their own version of a break by implementing three Mind, Body and Spirit Days on Feb. 23, March 24 and April 15.

The goal of these days is to still be able to provide a break for students that they normally would’ve had during spring break.

Following their announcement, some students expressed uncertainty towards whether or not having a break from school work to allow for time to focus on yourself would be attainable with only one-day breaks. The first Mind, Body and Spirit day proved that this was in fact possible.

On Feb. 23, classes were canceled and different activities and events around campus were offered to students.

On Feb. 17, New Paltz News posted a letter explaining the details of the Mind, Body and Spirit day signed by President Donald P. Christian and other members of campus administration.

“The theme for our first Mind, Body, Spirit Day is ‘Love and Nourish,’ in homage to Valentine’s Day and National Eating Disorders Awareness Week. Between learning remotely, the weather, anxiety over health, finances and current events, we all can benefit from paying attention to our own and each other’s well-being,” read the letter. “We hope that students, faculty and staff will use these days to restore themselves and support one another as a community.”

On Feb. 23 at 2 p.m., a yoga class was held at the Hawk Center with instructor Gianna until 3:30 p.m. The class was focused on self-compassion.

First-year English major Morgan D’Amore attended the class and said that it really allowed her to focus on herself.

“For the mind, body, and spirit day I woke up later than usual and I attended the yoga class that was held in the gym. I didn’t have any work due, but I finished some notes that I started the day before,” D’Amore said. “I think the activities provided by the school helped to make the day more worth the while as opposed to merely a day without work.”

Second-year geography Marissa Trojan also attended the yoga class.
“For mind, body and spirit day I went to yoga with Gianna,” Trojan said. “It was definitely a challenge but really rewarding in a way. We did some basic yoga poses and just focused on ourselves.”

A Holistic Movement class with instructor Shannon was held at 7:30 p.m. at the Athletic & Wellness Center Dance Studio. The class focused on body positivity, in observation of National Eating Disorder Awareness Week.
At noon, everyone was welcome to show their gratitude by decorating thank you cards for health care workers in the Atrium.

For non-group activities, the Atrium gave out paint by numbers kits from 3 to 5 p.m.

Overall, students were able to use the day to focus on themselves.

“I went on a run and then went to the yoga class at the wellness center and colored in the SUB,” said first-year English major Carlin Freck. “I did have work to do, but I felt in a better headspace to do it. I had lots of time to focus on me which was so nice.”

However, having the day off did not mean that students were without work.
“I had some breakfast with friends after sleeping in and am catching up on work [today],” said first-year undeclared student Olivia Tracey. “I have quite a bit but I viewed this day as a workday, to begin with.”

It was also suggested that students take the day to focus on themselves and their well-being. Students were reminded that the Psychological Counseling Center and Reach Out SUNY are both available resources.

The Student Resilience Advocates also shared positive messages and self-care ideas on their Instagram account, @np_resilience.

“We hope that students, faculty and staff will use these days to restore themselves and support one another as a community,” read the letter.

533,"Sep. 22 - MARION  -  Aaron Smith of Marion announced Tuesday evening that he is a Republican candidate for state representative in the new 118th District of the Illinois House at an event held in Tower Square Pizza.
Smith is a partner in Smith Hafeli Inc., a commercial construction firm, and vice chairman of John A. Logan College Board of Trustees.
Smith had no plans to run for office until he saw the map of the new legislative districts for the state.
""Chicago Democrats played politics with the map once again and cost us our representative,"" Smith said. ""I asked myself who is going to stand up for our region in Springfield?""
He talked to family and friends and prayed about before deciding that he was the person who should fight for Southern Illinois.
Smith believes Southern Illinois has a set of values that do not always conform to the values of the northern region of the state. He says the state is pushing values that this region does not want, particularly in schools.

He is also concerned about the business climate in the state. Smith is a small business owner and says the state of Illinois has one of the most difficult climates to do business in. In the 118th District, everyone is an hour away from another state with a better climate for business. He said those states are all more business friendly than Illinois.
""The business climate might work in a major city, but it does not work on our region,"" Smith said.
Smith plans to fight mandates and lock downs going forward.
""Eighteen months ago, the pandemic started. Gov. Pritzker engaged in a major overreach by enacting shut downs. People lost their livelihoods and their savings, and we are no safer from COVID,"" Smith said.
Smith plans to fund his campaign with private donations and his own money. He says too much outside funding is pushed into Southern Illinois campaigns. Often, that funding appears to come with strings attached.
""I want to go to Springfield not owning anyone,"" he said.
He was introduced at the event by Marion Football Coach Kerry Martin. Smith did his student teaching with Martin. He was hired by the district and taught and coached with Martin.
""I've always appreciated his values, perception and intelligence. He was very wise at a young age. He has great clarity on very complex issues,"" Martin said.

536,"Sep. 2 - Second-year Calhoun Community College student Maddi Zeanah received her first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine Wednesday but said the $150 incentive offered by the school to students and employees was not her primary motivation.
""I was probably going to get it anyway,"" she said. However, she admits the incentive is a nice bonus and getting vaccinated also had another benefit other than protection.
""I'm on the golf team, so if someone on the team gets COVID, I'd only have to quarantine for three days, as opposed to 14 or 15 days.""
Zeanah's decision to get vaccinated reflected the trend officials are seeing statewide. Financial incentives are providing limited motivation, but more people are seeking vaccinations.
""Unfortunately, the delta virus has clearly played a role in that because so many people have been sick,"" said Judy Smith, area administrator of the Alabama Department of Public Health. ""The biggest motivator for people has been all the numbers of people that are sick, the numbers of people that are in the hospital.""
The total number of virus patients in state hospitals was 2,880 on Wednesday, not far below below the pandemic high-water mark of 3,087 reached in January.
Over the last week, an average of 92 Morgan County residents and 65 Limestone residents have tested positive for the coronavirus per day.
Calhoun, which is in Decatur-annexed Limestone County, had 30 students and employees receive the Moderna vaccine in the first two days of a campus vaccination clinic that continues today from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the math and science building.
Another Calhoun student vaccinated Wednesday, retiree Jim Wicks, who is majoring in music technology, said he was hesitant to get his first dose of vaccine.
""You hear so many opinions on each side about how it can affect you, good or bad,"" Wicks said. ""I heard about possible side effects, and I know it hasn't been tested like other drugs. So, I thought I'd wait awhile and see what happens and just observe.""
Zeanah said she was not worried about side effects from the vaccine. ""Everyone I talked to just said that you might feel a little bad after the first few days (but) were fine afterward.""  -  'Protecting their students'
Wicks said he didn't need the financial incentive but it would be nice to have.
Calhoun is one of about two dozen community colleges in the state offering some type of incentive for vaccinations. Smith said her main concern is that people get vaccinated, regardless of whether an incentive is offered.
""Nationwide, the incentives have not been as encouraging as we would have liked them to have been, but again, people are reaching out to do whatever they can to make things happen,"" she said.
Alabama still ranks near the bottom in the nation for the percentage of people fully vaccinated with about 38%, according to data from the Mayo Clinic.
Smith said she supports the incentive Calhoun is offering students and employees.
""I think it's a demonstration of how important that these colleges feel about protecting their students,"" she said. ""We wish people would take the vaccine without it, but if that's what it takes, then clearly the college is speaking to their kids.""
Calhoun students and staff who previously received the vaccines will also be eligible for the incentive. Students must be enrolled in the fall 2021 semester and taking credit-bearing classes to be receive the $150 payment. The incentives will be paid out on or near Nov. 30.  -  Encounters with COVID
This time last year Zeanah had COVID, but said that it was not too bad. ""The only problem I really had was breathing. I'd be sitting in bed and couldn't get a full breath of air, and I've never had problems breathing.""
Zeanah's brother also had COVID, but it was more severe. They both were diagnosed at the beginning of the 2020-2021 school year. ""He got it at the beginning of the school year, and he didn't go back until the beginning of this school year,"" she said.
Wicks said he had COVID a couple of months ago but his symptoms were mild. He finally decided to go ahead with the vaccine. ""It just seems like, at my age, it would probably be a good move to get it done,"" said Wicks, who is in his 60s.
Wicks said several of his friends have had COVID. ""They had fairly mild symptoms to very sick. One guy just got out of the hospital."" Another one of his friends died recently from COVID.
Calhoun said 25 students or faculty members were vaccinated Monday and five Wednesday. Tuesday's clinic was canceled due to threatening weather but may be rescheduled.
Calhoun will hold vaccination clinics next week, on Tuesday and Wednesday, at its Huntsville campus. It will be in the Sparkman Building Student Center from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m.
Other community colleges are offering various incentives. Southern Union State Community College in Wadley, Opelika and Valley will enter students who show proof of vaccination into a drawing for a $500 scholarship for the spring semester. At Gadsden State Community College, students who are fully vaccinated will be eligible for a $500 book assistance program, and full-time employees can receive a $50 voucher to the campus cafeteria or campus bookstores.

537,"OLYMPIA - A year ago COVID-19 swept through the state's prisons. At Airway Heights Corrections Center, 92% of its population come down with the virus during the peak of the infections.
Now as the omicron variant spreads quickly across the state, cases in the state's prisons are rising again, too.
The Department of Corrections is seeing its highest COVID-19 numbers yet. As of Friday, 19 facilities were on outbreak status. More than 20% of the state's prison population - about 2,600 inmates - are sick. More than 700 staff members also were sick with the virus as of Friday.
Airway Heights had 575 active COVID-19 cases among inmates. A week ago, that number was 294. Cases among staff are currently at 101, as of Friday. Coyote Ridge had 265 active COVID-19 cases among inmates and 106 active COVID-19 cases among staff.
Inmates at Airway Heights say the conditions are similar to those they experienced in winter of 2020.
""We're making the same mistakes over and over again,"" said Tobias Wilson, who is currently serving time there.
INMATES, FAMILIES FEEL 'HOPELESS'
Beginning Jan. 19, Airway Heights main institution went on ""restricted movement status"" due to a facility wide outbreak, according to a memo. Restricted movement means the population could not attend regularly scheduled programs, call-outs and services.
According to a Jan. 22 memo from the Department of Corrections, Airway Heights is continuing to test the entire population, and staff are required to test twice a week. All facilities use both rapid and PCR testing for incarcerated people, department spokespeople Jacque Koe and Rachel Ericson wrote in an email to The Spokesman-Review.
Rapid testing is used to quickly identify positive people in order to slow the spread in a living unit or before a transport, according to the email. PCR testing, on the other hand, is used regularly when it is needed to test the entire population or ""when otherwise determined a necessity by medical staff.""
Wilson, who was at Airway Heights during last year's outbreak, said he is seeing people get sick for the second time, despite having been vaccinated.
Wilson said they are being tested but his unit is using tests that take days to get results, as opposed to rapid tests that are ready within 15 minutes. During the time people are waiting for their test results, Wilson said they continue to move around as normal without knowing if they are infected .
Wilson was one of the first people who tested positive for COVID-19 last year. Now, one year later, he is still awaiting test results to tell him if he has it a second time.
""Do I believe I've been exposed? Yes,"" he said.
In its three-times-a-week COVID-19 bulletin, the Department of Corrections said people who test positive are temporarily moved to medical isolation areas that are separate from quarantined areas. People who are quarantined are able to stay in their living unit. Individuals who are at a higher risk for testing positive are often moved to single-cell quarantine areas, according to the bulletin.
If someone has a cellmate who tests positive for COVID-19, for example, the person who did not test positive is moved to quarantine in a single cell. This protects individuals in the living unit who are not positive for COVID-19 and better allows clinical teams to monitor positive individuals, according to the bulletin.
""Upon receipt of confirmed positive test results for incarcerated individuals, every effort is made to move those individuals to medical isolation areas to separate them from healthy individuals,"" according to an email from Department spokespeople.
But incarcerated people and their families say inmates are mixed up regardless of COVID-19 status, meaning those with negative tests and positive tests end up in the same room.
Greg Hyde, an inmate at Airway Heights, said his unit was tested for COVID-19, but didn't receive their results until five days later. During those five days, the unit was moving around like normal. After about 30 people tested positive, he said everyone in the unit received rapid tests. Hyde estimated about 40 more people tested positive on those rapid tests.
Even after the test results, Hyde said people who tested positive and tested negative are ""co-mingling.""
""They're using the same approaches that failed,"" Hyde said.
Terry Grant, an inmate at Airway Heights, said he was one of the first people to test positive during this outbreak. After testing positive, he said he moved around four times, eventually spending four days with 100 other inmates in the gym.
Since then, he's moved back into his cell with his cellmate who had tested negative.
Daniel Hawn is in a minimum security unit and said his tier of 18 people has not had any positive COVID-19 cases as of Friday. He said everyone in his unit has taken eight rapid tests and one PCR test in the past two weeks.
Despite no one testing positive, Hawn said his tier is in quarantine mode ""indefinitely,"" meaning they only get out once or twice a day for 45 minutes at a time.
Grant said staff are not treating them badly, but they are making the same decisions they did last year.
""They just did not prepare themselves for this,"" Grant said. ""They are going to give everybody this virus.""
Others, like Wilson, are reporting worse conditions. He said he and others in his unit were locked down in cells with no toilet or access to water for hours at a time. He also said medical staff has not done regular wellness checks.
""If you know you're in outbreak status, where's the medical staff?"" he said. ""I don't see them.""
At Airway Heights, inmates now get one hot meal a day instead of their usual two. The other two meals a day are often frozen or something small, like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, inmates say, and the meals they do receive often arrive late.
According to the Department of Corrections, the change in meals is due to ""critical-staffing levels and lack of incarcerated workers."" As more staff members and inmates get sick, fewer people are available to make and deliver food.
In a letter to families, Secretary Cheryl Strange acknowledged meals are taking longer to serve but said everyone in the facility has the opportunity to eat every meal. She added there is ""unlimited access to water in cells and common areas used for quarantine and isolation.""
Still, families are worried for what conditions their family members are in. As of Jan. 12, the department temporarily suspended all visitation to prison facilities. Because inmates have restricted movement, they only have access to phones at certain times of day.
""It's a repeat of last year, but it's worse,"" said Kehaulani Walker, founder of Families of the Incarcerated. Walker, whose husband is an inmate at Monroe Correctional Complex, advocates for families with people in the prison system.
Walker said she's never heard her husband, Matthew, sound as worried as he does.
""I feel so hopeless,"" Walker said. ""I don't want my husband to die in prison.""
Ilea Wilson said she goes days without hearing from her husband, Tobias. Before the outbreak, she would talk to him multiple times a day. She said she struggles to get information from the Department of Corrections about how her husband is doing, and ""nobody knows what's going on.""
""When it hit in 2020, nobody knew what to do and there was a lot of miscommunication,"" she said. ""And now, it feels like they didn't learn anything.""
DEPARTMENT DEALS WITH STAFFING SHORTAGES AS VIRUS SPREADS AMONG EMPLOYEES
As of Friday, 728 inmates had active COVID-19 cases, but the number of staff out sick ""varies widely and changes each day,"" department spokespeople wrote in an email.
Staff members are advised to stay home anywhere from five to 10 days from the date of their positive test, according to spokespeople. Staff must achieve a negative test through rapid testing before they can return to their shifts.
In a Jan. 14 all-staff memo, Deputy Secretary Sean Murphy wrote to department employees that the staffing issue facing the state's prisons is ""one that has never been experienced before.""
""Many frontline prison employees have shared their concerns regarding the lack of staffing and the amount of overtime they are enduring,"" the memo read. ""We hear you and understand the impacts to you, your families, and those in our care and custody.""
To assist with the shortage, the department was evaluating custody staff in screening and testing areas and nonpermanent positions and moving them back into custody positions. The department was using staff on modified duty to complete screening, testing and mapping. The department said it also was using management to cover some posts when staff were out sick to help reduce overtime.
Staff from other areas have also volunteered to assist when needed, according to the memo.
The department also halted all visitation for prisons and work release facilities in an attempt to slow the spread. It added it would stop movement and programs for inmates as necessary but was ""cautious because this can create other safety issues and hinder re-entry success.""
WHAT THE STATE'S DOING
Gov. Jay Inslee told reporters Thursday the Department of Corrections is doing ""everything it can,"" but it can be difficult to slow the spread in congregate settings like prisons.
He said Corrections employees are continuing to mask and test regularly. The state is making sure the vaccine and boosters are widely available to inmates.
Inslee said there are no immediate plans for early release of inmates like what he did at the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 because he thinks case rates will decline soon.
""We do believe that it is likely we will see a relatively rapid decline in the relatively near future,"" Inslee said Thursday.
Inslee did not say Thursday whether he would be sending the National Guard to help with staffing shortages in Corrections facilities.
Department of Corrections spokespeople said they are in regular contact with the Department of Health, the state Emergency Management Division and the governor's office to identify any resources needed.

540,"Jan. 19SHARES in animal genetics business Genus hit an all-time high as it brought home the bacon for investors.
The company, which selectively breeds livestock and sells bull and pig sperm to farmers, said it was hiking its profit forecasts following a 'strong' performance in the six months to December 31.
It is now expecting a first-half adjusted profit of between £47m and £49m, compared to last year's £36.6m. That is based on expected revenues of between £285m and £287m, up from £270.7m.
Genus said its pig division was experiencing booming demand, particularly in China where pork producers are growing their herds again after being devastated by African swine fever.
ABS, its cattle breeding business, is also doing well in Brazil, Russia, India and again in China.
However, the firm warned that growth in the second half was likely to slow because of the growing prevalence of Covid-19 across the globe, which is causing 'challenges for our customers and employees'. Following the update, its shares at one stage hit an all-time high of 4560p. They closed up 4.2pc, or 180p, at 4492p, valuing the company at £2.9bn.
It came on a day of pig-related news, with sausage skin maker Devro also telling investors that it enjoyed good trading during the final three months of 2020. That helped the firm's shares to fatten by 3.2pc, or 5p, to 160p.
Elsewhere, the FTSE 100 struggled to get lift off as traders digested gloomy High Street footfall figures and new travel restrictions being introduced in the UK.
The index sunk 0.22pc, or 15.06 points, to 6720.65. However, the FTSE 250 of mid-sized firms fared slightly better rising 0.12pc, or 23.75 points, to 20,639.34.
David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, said: 'The current environment is not exactly upbeat as things are getting worse with respect to the lockdowns.'
Airline stocks shuddered following the announcement of tough new arrival checks at airports and the closing of travel corridors with the UK, which are expected to have a further chilling effect on bookings. British Airways owner IAG fell 0.8pc, or 1.35p, to 160.9p, with budget operator Easyjet falling 1.9pc, or 16p, to 816p.
Fellow low-cost carrier Ryanair fell 3pc, or 0.49, to 15.30.
It was a mixed day for miners with traders convinced the US dollar will grow stronger under incoming president Joe Biden, making commodities quoted in the currency more expensive.
Glencore fell 1.1pc, or 3.05p, to 276.85p, while BHP lost 0.9pc, or 19p, closing at 2116p. Rio Tinto, however, rose 0.5pc, or 28p, to 5974p, as did Anglo American, which edged up 0.4pc, or 11.5p, to 2675p. Financial services firm CPP shot higher after reporting a stronger than expected business comeback in India, its main growth market. CPP's shares surged 51.8pc, or 170p, to 498p after it said this meant 2020 revenues should reach about £140m, rather than the £133m forecast.
But it was another bad day for defence and outsourcing firm Babcock, which saw shares slide 6.8pc, or 15p, to 205.3p after brokers at Liberum and Morgan Stanley cut their target prices.
Babcock spooked investors last week when it warned it was reviewing its balance sheet and expected the exercise to have a 'negative' impact on income. The shares are down by 22pc since the announcement.
British Gas owner Centrica dipped 2.2pc, or 1.1p, to 49.5p after announcing that finance chief Johnathan Ford was stepping down after less than a year in the post. The company said the departure was for personal reasons and has appointed Kate Ringrose as his replacement.

",Matt Oliver: Genus Hits Record High As It Beefs Up Profit Forecast
543,"TOMS RIVER - For months, some parents have been coming to school board meetings to sound off on a new state mandate they contend will harm their children.
No, the object of their ire isn't Gov. Phil Murphy's mask mandate for students returning to classrooms in the fall; it's another cultural flashpoint for New Jersey, and much of the nation as well — new curriculum emphasizing diversity and inclusion.
Spurred by legislation enacted in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder, the new state mandate requires districts to ""highlight and promote diversity, including economic diversity, equity, inclusion, tolerance, and belonging in connection with gender and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, disabilities, and religious tolerance.""
The state Education Department has yet to issue guidance on how such lessons should be introduced. Nonetheless, the initiative has sparked worry among a vocal contingent of Toms River parents who contend the instruction will divide students and particularly ostracize white students.
Some parents have asserted as well — wrongly, school district officials say — that the curriculum will incorporate ""critical race theory"" or CRT, a college-level concept that considers, among other things, the role of systemic racism in society. Toms River and state education officials say no such thing is envisioned, but detractors of the new mandate say they are skeptical and unconvinced.
""It gives a gateway for adults to tell children, my children, anybody else's children, that they are racist,"" parent Warren Crosby said. ""Let's not teach our white children that they are racist... I cannot accept that our children can be called racist and treated differently by virtue of their skin color.""
A handful of the parents — as many as a dozen have addressed the school board in recent weeks — say they are so concerned about the new curriculum mandate they have elected to pull their children from the public school system. The controversy, however, is not unique to Toms River or even New Jersey schools.
School districts across the nation have been thrust into new discussions about diversity and inclusion and CRT — whether such instruction is contemplated or not, or even fully understood. The discussions have been spurred in part by new state laws that were the outgrowth of 2020's marches and protests for racial and social justice, spurred in part by the May 25, 2020 murder of Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police.
Media have played a role as well, with Fox News, by one account, mentioning CRT more than 1,900 times in less than 31/2 months, typically in ""distorted"" or ""absurd"" terms, according to the watchdog group Media Matters. The arising attention and controversy helped spark a parent-centered recall effort for six of the nine school board members in a suburban Loudon County, Virginia, school district.
Several states have moved to bar teachers from discussing CRT in their classrooms, even as Floyd's death forced a renewed focus on the experiences of Black people and historically marginalized communities in the U.S. and across the globe. Conservative members of Congress have raised objections to CRT as well, on matters ranging from education policy to military training.
Media Matters called Fox's ""obsession"" with CRT — it accuses the network of labeling ""everything to do with race"" as CRT — a bid to ""drum up outrage"" ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. Whatever the rationale, the angst is spreading.
Walter Greason, dean emeritus of the Honors School, and associate professor and chair of the Department of Educational Counseling and Leadership at Monmouth University, decried much of the treatment.
He said there have been ""divisive and false representations"" of both culturally inclusive teaching and ongoing efforts to promote equity in schools.
""These radical conservatives that have kind of been radicalized the last five years, they have to find ways to scare more moderate people, to try to get them to join their agenda,"" said Greason, who this fall will become a professor and chair of the Department of History at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.
Critical race in the spotlight
As social scientists explain it, critical race theory is a framework that examines if, and how, systems and policies perpetuate racism. It was developed during the 1970s and 1980s in response to what was seen as a lack of racial progress following the landmark civil rights legislation of the 1960s.
It centers on the idea that racism is systemic in the nation's institutions and that they function to maintain the dominance of white people in society. It has been derided by conservative critics who sometimes label it as ""anti-American"" and maintain it unfairly portrays white people through the sweep of history.
In particular, CRT has been panned by critics who blame it for societal reassessments ranging from the removal of Confederate monuments and statues to the renaming of U.S. military bases. An eight-person commission is looking to drop the names of 10 military installations named after Confederate military leaders.
In the context of schools, CRT has been invoked by critics to oppose more inclusive instruction and more diverse teaching staffs. It also has been cited to oppose lessons that highlight the history of racial violence and enduring legacy of slavery in the U.S., including 1921's Tulsa Race Massacre, when white mobs destroyed the Greenwood district, known as ""Black Wall Street."" Hundreds died in the slaughter.
CRT is not on the agenda in New Jersey, education officials insist, but the worry among some parents persists.
Toms River parent Crosby has repeatedly raised concerns at school board meetings about a portion of the new state mandate that instructs schools to ""examine the impact that unconscious bias and economic disparities have at both an individual level and on society as a whole.""
Crosby called critical race theory ""the ideological grandchild of Marxism."" He said he fears it is an attempt to establish a ""state religion,"" with the New York Times' ""1619 Project"" as the movement's ""bible."" The 1619 Project, published in 2019, includes historical analysis an essays on how slavery shaped American political, social, and economic institutions.
The 1619 Project was accompanied by extensive study guides and other resources made available for classroom instruction.
New Jersey school districts and parents are still awaiting resources from the state Education Department that will help teachers incorporate lessons in diversity and inclusion into classroom instruction.
""The NJDOE is working to provide resources designed to promote diversity and inclusion,"" as specified in the law signed by the governor, according to Education Department spokeswoman Shaheed Morris.
She gave no timetable for when the resources would be made available to districts.
Toms River Regional Assistant Superintendent Cara DiMeo reassured parents in July and August that a new diversity and inclusion curriculum mandated by the state is not ""critical race theory,"" which she described as a college- or graduate-school level concept inappropriate for children in grades K-12.
Another parent, Shelby Bowes, of Beachwood, a Toms River Regional teacher, said she feared that the diversity and inclusion curriculum will be used to divide children by race, gender or ethnic backgrounds.
A handful of parents said they have pulled their children out of the public schools, or could do so in the future, citing concerns about the diversity and inclusion lessons, as well as new state-mandated changes to the sex education curriculum. They said the changes touch on subjects that should be discussed by families, not in school.
The health and sex education curriculum is slated to go into effect in the 2022-2023 school year.
Toms River resident Joseph Steffer said he objects not only to masking his children — another worry on the minds of some parents ahead of the new term — but to ""critical race education and putting a swab up my child's nose,"" referring to testing for COVID-19.
He suggested putting cameras in the classroom, ""focused on the teachers,"" so parents can see what is being taught. That's illegal, school board Attorney William Burns told Steffer, noting state law bars the filming of children and teachers in class.
Professor Greason said he has held several workshops with dozens of New Jersey school district administrators, counselors and other school officials to help ""train them on how to deal with questions on racism and social justice.""
He said the work is necessary, notwithstanding the pushback from critics.
""Attacking this at the board level in the name of some kind of political movement, it deeply injures the future of our state and young people,"" Greason said. ""It is a very short-sighted backlash and is being used to drum up votes.""
An increasingly diverse district
Toms River Regional, which includes children from Toms River, Pine Beach, Beachwood and South Toms River, is growing increasingly diverse. About 66% of the 14,400 students in the district were white in the 2020-2021 school year, according to data from the state Department of Education.
About 21% were Hispanic; 5% were Black; approximately 4% were Asian, and another 4% were of mixed race. The district includes three high schools, three intermediate schools and 12 elementary schools.
Greason said promoting equity in the classroom helps strengthen the entire school system, and helps all children achieve more. He said he fears that school boards may be intimidated by parents who demand to see teachers' lesson plans in order to search for something ""they may find objectionable.""
""There is a strong instinct among people in Monmouth and Ocean counties, parents especially, to think that the system really works well, and there is no reason to change it,"" Greason said. ""There is a lot of denial about the way the system doesn't work for some of the students.""
To no avail, parent Crosby asked the school board to condemn, in writing, the state Assembly bill which mandated the teaching of diversity, inclusion and the impact of unconscious bias. The bill was signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy earlier this year.
""The bill that you talked about is already the law of the land, what is still pending are the regulations,"" said Burns, the school board attorney.
""Despite it being signed into law, immoral legislation is still immoral legislation, I would urge the board to make a public letter condemning it,"" Crosby said.
Beachwood resident Bowes, the parent who is also a teacher in the district, also told board members she opposes the diversity and inclusion curriculum requirements.
""I refuse to have my children taught that Blacks are the oppressed and whites are the oppressors,"" Bowes said. ""...As a parent I am simply against an agenda.""
The Toms River parents' concerns are supported by groups like The Center for Garden State Families, a New Jersey nonprofit that says its mission ""is to protect and promote faith, freedom and the natural family, in culture and public policy, as held by the traditional Christian worldview.""
Garden State Families' founder and president, Gregory Quinlan, has described critical race theory as ""a Marxist assault on our nation"" and urged parents to fight back.
""It is now evident that the Covid-19 pandemic was used to alter the future of education in the United States of America,"" Quinlan wrote in a recent essay published on the nonprofit's website. ""In addition to remote learning, legislatures took it as an opportunity to transform the curriculum in our schools.""
Broad outlines
While details of the New Jersey effort have not yet been set forth, the broad outlines are known.
""Schools in New Jersey reflect the rich diversity of our state,"" said the sponsors, Democratic Assembly member Carol Murphy, Verlina Reynolds-Jackson and Anthony Verrelli, in a statement after Murphy signed the legislation. ""In health and physical education classes, students are taught to respect their individual and cultural differences to build healthy relationships both in and out of the classroom. The natural next step is to promote diversity, tolerance and respect for all. These are values students will take with them long after they graduate.""
According to the law, the new curriculum must:
highlight and promote diversity, including economic diversity, equity, inclusion, tolerance, and belonging in connection with gender and sexual orientation, race and ethnicity, disabilities, and religious tolerance;
examine the impact that unconscious bias and economic disparities have at both an individual level and on society as a whole; and
encourage safe, welcoming, and inclusive environments for all students regardless of race or ethnicity, sexual and gender identities, mental and physical disabilities, and religious beliefs.
""There does seem to be a push from the conservative right to label everything as critical race theory,"" said Dr. Tabitha Dell'Angelo, a professor in Urban/Elementary & Urban/Early Childhood Education Coordinator at The College of New Jersey.
While running for a school board seat in Pennsylvania, Dell'Angelo said she has heard repeatedly from parents that schools are ""trying to indoctrinate our kids.""
""In a lot of ways, that is what American public schooling has been doing all along,"" Dell'Angelo said. ""We have been indoctrinating kids into a Euro-centric system of beliefs.""
For example, she said, New Jersey town histories typically start with the first settlers who arrived in colonial times, ignoring the history of the native peoples who had lived on the land for centuries before.
""The status quo curriculum that has been taught for years and years and years has made a lot of kids of color feel bad,"" she said. ""The way we have been teaching has made a lot of kids feel crappy.""
Concerns elsewhere
Dell'Angelo said the aim of teaching about diversity and inclusion is not to make children feel guilty, but instead to learn about ""the world in which we live and where we fit into it.""
""It is a problem of fragility to imagine that our kids can't handle learning about the past,"" she said. ""If I have a German student in my class, can I not teach about the Holocaust?""
Toms River is not the only district in the state where parents have raised concerns about the diversity and inclusion curriculum.
In Wayne, Superintendent Dr. Mark Toback wrote a letter to parents explaining that critical race theory is not part of the curriculum, but noting that the district must be sensitive to community concerns about what is being taught in class.
So far, 25 states have considered legislation or other steps to limit how race and racism can be taught, according to an analysis from Education Week.
Eight states, all Republican-led, including Florida, Tennessee and Oklahoma, have banned or limited the teaching of critical race theory or similar concepts through laws or administrative actions, even though there is little evidence that the theory is actually being taught in K-12 classrooms.
The New Jersey School Boards Association has created guidance for school board members to discuss the new curriculum with concerned parents.
""Critical race theory is not required by the New Jersey Student Learning Standards,"" the association's guidance reads. ""...It is important to remember that teaching social studies and history will at times require discussion about historic instances of racism. Students should understand the historically accurate past of our nation and that includes some difficult history around racial issues.""
In a question and answer section about the new curriculum posted on Toms River Regional's website, the district said that from ""our initial interpretation of the bill,"" diversity and inclusion would be taught in younger grades ""by emphasizing that our students accept all children; such lessons reflect resources and discussions that promote tolerance and examine differences in backgrounds and families.""
""As students get older, diversity is taught in a more direct manner,"" according to the school district. ""As we currently do through the anti-bullying legislation of 2012, teachers would spend time discussing bullying and what makes a good friend. Furthermore, we discuss families and how some families look different than other families and have different traditions. Lastly, we would continue to celebrate and learn from our cultural diversity.""
Toms River Regional spokesman Michael Kenny said the district has also partnered with Dr. Edward Fergus, an associate professor of education and human development at Temple University. Fergus' academic work is focused on the effects of educational policy and practices on low-income as well as racial and ethnic minority students.
Help from Temple U.
Fergus was hired after the school system was identified based on an education department study that explored whether a district was ""disproportionately classifying students from specific subgroups as intellectually disabled or requiring special services,"" or ""in matters of discipline,"" Kenny said.
Black students in New Jersey were 5.4 times more likely to face out-of-school suspension compared with white students, while Hispanic students were 2.4 times more likely, according to a ProPublica analysis of 2015-16 federal data.
Across the country, Black students were 3.9 times more likely to be suspended, and Hispanic students were 1.3 times more likely, the 2015-16 data showed.
Fergus has conducted five workshops with administrators and is helping the district's leadership team study the root causes of ""disproportionality,"" looking at gender, socioeconomic status and disability in each individual school, Kenny said.
""The next steps include Dr. Fergus and his team at Temple helping us to create equity goals for the 2021-2022 school year, and helping us implement multi-tiered systems of support and additional resources to continue training our staff,"" Kenny said.
Crosby questioned DiMeo and board members about Fergus at the Aug. 18 meeting, singling out tweets by Fergus that Crosby said showed the educator ""is striving for a narrative that does not fit"" Toms River schools.
He asked the district to ""sever"" its relationship with Fergus.
""Now I want to ask for it as a clear standard, that we will not tolerate racism against white people or Black people,"" Crosby said.
School board President Joseph Nardini reiterated that the district's curriculum does not include CRT.
""I judge people on their character, I don't judge them on their color,"" Nardini said.
Greason said that school boards must make sure that parents have plenty of ways to communicate with district officials and express their concern. He added that administrators and school boards must work together to explain educational equity and diversity to parents, and not allow themselves be bullied.
""My biggest concern are educational leaders who don't have the tools to really facilitate a more informed conversation,"" he said.
Dell'Angelo said statements by some scholars of critical race theory have been taken out of context to scare parents.
""if you listen to some scholars of critical race theory, you will sometimes hear people say, 'if you are white, you are racist,' "" Dell'Angelo said. ""The problem is, that is a very scholarly discussion (but) If a lay person hears that, that stings.....The phrase gets thrown around. I have heard it in workshops and seminars. It could be misread and seem very personal, when it isn't intended to be.""
At a recent school board meeting, Toms River resident Rachel Remelgado praised the year-old law that requires the history and experiences of LGBTQ people and people with disabilities be incorporated into school lessons for students in intermediate and high schools.
""Society has, up until now, marginalized them,"" she said. ""We finally have a start, a start for this group of people....Representation matters, not just for some, but for all students.""

548,"Middle Tennessee State University wrapped up its first day of the spring graduation season, holding events at Murphy Center for the first time since December 2019.
The COVID-19 pandemic forced the university to hold virtual ceremonies for the Class of 2020 last May and August before being able to host an outdoor event at Floyd Stadium in November, according to a news release.
The weekend's final ceremony was set aside for 2020 graduates unable to participate in previous events.
At Friday's first ceremony, University President Sidney A. McPhee expressed his pride in both the graduates and the people supporting them, including the staffers who he said ""worked tirelessly"" to safely revamp commencement.
""I always say that our graduation ceremonies are the most significant events in the life of our university. These ceremonies, under these conditions and precautions, are even more significant,"" he told the students and audience.
MTSU's spring class of 2021 consists of 2,488 students.
With a tiara on her mortarboard, new graduate Abigail Painter can call herself the queen of multitasking. While pursuing a bachelor's degree in family and consumer sciences as a full-time student, Painter worked two to three jobs at a time, the news release said.
A Tullahoma, she native plans to return to MTSU in August to start working toward a master's degree in criminal justice administration while continuing at her current job as a probation and parole officer for the state. She's also enrolled in the Tennessee Law Enforcement Training Academy in Nashville for additional certifications.
Leah Lyons, interim dean of MTSU's College of Liberal Arts, told her college's graduates — and her new fellow alumni — that the challenges they and their peers have faced and overcome should now reassure them.
""Whatever your response is to what comes next, just know that you are ready. Whatever next step you take, know that you are ready. You have the liberal arts education you need to make it happen, so you're ready,"" said Lyons, who earned her Bachelor of Arts degree from MTSU as a dual French and English major.
Ceremonies continue Saturday and Sunday as follows:

549,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, Jan. 15 -- Mary R. Grealy, president of the Healthcare Leadership Council, has issued a public comment on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services rule entitled ""Most Favored Nation Model"". The comment was written on Dec. 21, 2020, and posted on Jan. 5, 2021:* * *The Healthcare Leadership Council appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the interim final rule (IFC) issued by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) on its Most Favored Nation (MFN) drug pricing model.HLC is a coalition of chief executives from all disciplines within American healthcare. It is the exclusive forum for the nation's healthcare leaders to jointly develop policies, plans, and programs to achieve their vision of a 21st century healthcare system that makes affordable high-quality care accessible to all Americans. Members of HLC - hospitals, academic health centers, health plans, pharmaceutical companies, medical device manufacturers, laboratories, biotech firms, health product distributors, post-acute care providers, home care providers, and information technology companies - advocate for measures to increase the quality and efficiency of healthcare through a patient-centered approach.Providing low cost, high quality prescription drugs to consumers is an important issue in promoting high quality healthcare. We applaud the unprecedented public-private partnerships that have been established to develop life-saving treatments for COVID-19, and CMS' flexibility in ensuring these treatments are delivered to Medicare beneficiaries at no cost. We are concerned, however, that the proposed MFN model would harm these advancements and result in fewer life-saving treatments made available to consumers.The MFN payment model would tie reimbursement for the top fifty Part B drugs to the single lowest price offered in a basket of foreign countries within the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Basing reimbursement for medicines that treat Medicare beneficiaries for severe diseases such as cancer and blood disorders, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis on the prices paid by OECD countries not only introduces artificial price controls in the U.S. market, but fails to recognize how these aggressive price controls negatively affect access and innovation. As a result of government-imposed price controls, these countries have significantly less access to many of the life-saving treatments developed over the last ten years. Australia, for example, only has access to 39% of new medicines developed between 2011-2019./1Pursing similar policies in the United States would result in significant challenges to future drug development for many different health conditions.We are also greatly concerned with the significant impact the MFN model would have on providers' ability to properly treat their patients. The Office of the Actuary (OACT) for CMS finds in the IFC that if this model were implemented, up to 19% of Medicare beneficiaries may lose access to life-saving drugs and therapies./2These beneficiaries could lose access to a variety of life-saving treatments, particularly patients being treated for different forms of cancer./3Additionally, making changes to the reimbursement framework for Part B drugs may force providers to transition patients to fewer effective treatments. Given the extreme burdens the COVID-19 health pandemic has imposed on patients and providers, HLC opposes any additional steps that would create greater limitations to care delivery.HLC also has significant concerns with the process by which CMS is attempting to implement the MFN model. Rather than go through the required notice and comment rulemaking process, where stakeholders can submit important feedback for CMS to consider, the MFN model is being implemented as an interim final rule, accelerating the implementation of the rule before sufficient feedback can be evaluated. We also have concerns that the model is being implemented through the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (CMMI) over a seven-year period. CMMI was created to evaluate discrete payment models that can improve care while reducing costs. Yet CMS has failed to incorporate a defined comparator group to evaluate what is being tested against current practices. Given the expansive nature of this model, we believe CMS should provide a more robust notice and comment period so that stakeholders can share their thoughts on the impact of the MFN model. Finalization of the MFN model fails to take any congressional input as well, as Congress has not authorized such a large-scale, national payment change in Part B at this time.We look forward to working with CMS in lowering the cost of drugs for patients but to do so in a way that does not put access at risk for Medicare beneficiaries, sacrifice innovation and import foreign price controls from countries that have very limited access to breakthrough therapies. We do not support the implementation of the MFN model and hope that CMS will rescind this IFC and instead work with stakeholders to develop a sustainable path for payment reform.

550,"Sep. 27 - There are lots of reasons to bet against the Birds on Monday night.
Brandon Graham's explosiveness at defensive end and leadership in the locker room disappeared when one of his 33-year-old Achilles tendons ruptured Sunday. Brandon Brooks' dominance at right guard is gone, again, this time the victim of a pectoral muscle strain.
On the other side of the ball, Dak is back: Dak Prescott, who missed the last 11 games of 2020, ranks sixth in the NFL with 320.0 passing yards per game.
The Eagles are on the road, they're 3 1/2 -point underdogs, and Nick Sirianni, in his third game as an NFL head coach, has idea what it's like to be the main enemy in the JerryDome and with Jalen Hurts making just his seventh NFL start, to boot.
Look closer, though, to find plenty of reasons why the Eagles, 1-1 like the Cowboys, could leave AT&T Stadium back on top of the NFC East.
Jonathan Gannon's pliable defense is No. 3 against the pass, while the Cowboys' passing defense is 31st. The Pokes currently have even more injury issues than the Eagles. And, of course, there's Mike McCarthy.
1. Cowboys' Big D is hurtin'
Defensive end DeMarcus Lawrence broke a foot at practice in the second week of the season, so he's out. His replacement, Dorance Armstrong, sprained an ankle last week, which likely will cost him three games. Starting defensive tackle Carlos Watkins sprained a knee last week, and he's been ruled out, as has backup tackle Trysten Hill. Middle linebacker Keanu Neal and backup defensive end Bradlee Anae both tested positive for COVID-19 last week and will not play.
Ouch.
2. Amari who?
This is the most significant subplot this week. No. 1 wide receiver Amari Cooper cracked a rib in the season-opening loss to the Buccaneers. He played last week, but he was targeted only five times and had just three catches for 24 yards. That's well below his averages of 8.1 targets and 5.6 catches in his 42 other regular-season starts since he was traded by the Raiders to the Cowboys in 2018.
Cooper's success against the Birds helped buoy those numbers. He's averaged 8.5 targets, 6.0 catches, and 91.3 yards in his six Eagles games as a Cowboy. Moreover, he's been an effective decoy. In Cooper's two worst games against the Eagles, Michael Gallup caught a combined 12 passes for 157 yards.
Yes, Cooper will play Monday night, but if he finishes this week with numbers like last week's  -  three catches for 24 yards  -  the Eagles' defense will be elated.
Another thing: Gallup's out until October with a calf injury.
3. Musical roles?
The defensive injuries complicate things for the Cowboys and their newfound pass rusher.
Defensive coordinator Dan Quinn cut loose rookie outside linebacker Micah Parsons to add ammunition to their weakened pass rush in last week's win over the Chargers. Parsons' ability to rush the passer at Penn State translated nicely to the NFL; he sacked Justin Hebert once and pressured him eight times.
However, Neal  -  a former safety  -  was expected to play a spy role on Eagles running quarterback Jalen Hurts. So, with Neal out, and with Jaylon Smith and Leighton Vander Esch getting more snaps, will Quinn be reluctant to let Parsons roam again?
4. The kids were all right
Second-round rookie Landon Dickerson  -  a first-round talent who dropped in the draft because of lingering injury questions  -  debuted at right guard last week when Brooks left the first quarter of the Eagles' loss to the 49ers. Dickerson got trucked on his first snap  -  a fact that went unnoticed since Hurts connected with Quez Watkins for a 91-yard bomb.
But Sirianni clearly didn't trust DIckerson enough to run behind him during Sirianni's play-calling debacle on first-and-goal at the 1.
As the game progressed, though, Dickerson settled in. Of course, he was playing between center Jason Kelce and right tackle Lane Johnson, who have seven Pro Bowl nods between them, and that sort of company can make for quick settlement. He'll be bookended by them again Sunday, he'll have had a week to prepare for the job, and he'll be facing a diminished defense, so the type of modest struggles he had against the 49ers with timing, communication, and technique should decrease.
""My play was not up to the standard we've set here,"" said Dickerson  -  who, after all, was facing a standard established by Brooks, a three-time Pro Bowl player. Nevertheless, ""I wasn't happy with the way I played.""
Dickerson shouldn't be so hard on himself, Johnson said: ""Last week he was out there on the fly. This week he'll have a full week of practice and probably feel a lot more prepared than last week.""
On the other side of the trench, third-round rookie Milton Williams has shown himself to be a sure tackler. Graham's exit should afford Williams more playing time both at tackle and end.

",Marcus Hayes: The Eagles can beat the Cowboys on Monday night: Five reasons why
551,"The average number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents across the Miami Valley over the past two weeks is higher than the state average; Warren County tops the list for the region and is 15th highest among the state’s 88 counties.
The Ohio Department of Health released three updated maps New Year’s Eve that show the virus spread and effect COVID-19 has on hospital ICUs across the state.
The first map — Cases per 100,000 Residents Over 2 Weeks — shows the cases per capita during the past couple weeks. Every county in Ohio exceeds the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s threshold for high incidence, which is 100 cases per 100,000 residents, according to a release from the ODH.
The statewide average of cases per capita during the previous two weeks was 258 at the beginning of November. For this week’s update, the statewide average is 658 cases per 100,000 residents during the past two weeks, the release stated.
There also are 71 of Ohio’s 88 counties with averages at 500 or more; this means that at least one out of every 200 residents has tested positive for COVID during the past two weeks and are at risk of spreading it to others, according to the ODH.
The average number of cases per 100,000 residents across the Miami Valley is higher than the state’s average at 694, data show. Following is a breakdown by county:
Warren County: 926.7
Miami County: 874.9
Darke County: 845.2
Butler County: 784.8
Montgomery County: 780
Greene County: 776.6
Clark County: 726.4
Preble County: 655.5
Logan County: 564.9
Champaign County: 537.5
The second map — Regional COVID-19 ICU Utilization — shows the percent of all ICU patients who are COVID positive and is shown as a weekly average by hospital preparedness region.

At the beginning of November, about 15% of Ohio’s ICU patents were COVID positive, or 1 out of every 7. Now, that percentage is 31%, which means that 1 out of every 3 ICU patients is COVID positive.
“The current impact on the health care system is severe and unsustainable,” the ODH release stated.
The ODH also released an updated Ohio Public Health Advisory System map, which shows that 84 counties in the state are red and four are orange.
“At these levels, residents are advised to exercise a high degree of caution and to limit activities as much as possible to help slow the spread of the virus,” the release said.
Ohio is no longer seeing sharp increases in new cases and hospitalizations; however, the effects of the recent holidays have not been seen.
That is why Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud on New Year’s Eve signed a health order encouraging people to stay at home between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. unless they are working or engaged in an essential activity. This extends the previous order until Jan. 23.
The ODH will not report new coronavirus information Friday in observance of the New Year’s Day holiday. Friday data will be reported on Saturday.",Coronavirus: Case average across Miami Valley higher than state’s average
554,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, issued the following news release:As the Senate negotiates the House passed coronavirus relief package, Gillibrand is urging Senate leadership to maintain House negotiated funding levels for Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) at $4.5 billion. Within the last year, the economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic has put an unprecedented financial burden on New Yorkers. Millions of New Yorkers are finding it more difficult to afford the cost of keeping the heat turned on in their homes during the cold winter months. According to the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association, one in five homes in the country is at least 60 days behind on the electric and gas utilities. Despite the $900 million in emergency LIHEAP funding allocated in the CARES Act, state energy officials estimate significant emergency supplemental funding is critical to help financially strained households and seniors across the country pay their energy bills and stay safe throughout the winter. Last month Senator Gillibrand made stops across New York State -- including in Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, Albany -- in her fight for robust LIHEAP funding in the next coronavirus relief package. ""The financial strain of the pandemic has hit New Yorkers hard, especially those living paycheck to paycheck. For months, cash-strapped individuals and families have worried if they can keep their lights on, warm their homes, and put food on the table. With unemployment remaining at record highs, Congress cannot wait to deliver vital relief,"" said Senator Gillibrand. ""LIHEAP is well-positioned to rapidly respond to, and support the needs of, households that are struggling to heat their homes this winter. Funding the program will provide a lifeline to New Yorkers in need and I will keep fighting to ensure it's included in the next relief package."" The average cost of home heating is unaffordable for millions of low-income households. New Yorkers can spend more than $2,700 a year on energy bills alone -- for low-income New Yorkers, that can amount to 20-40% of their income on energy. In addition, National Fuel announced that the cost of heating in Western New York would rise approximately $10 each month during the 2020-2021 winter season. The quick release of LIHEAP funds is an essential lifeline to families unemployed as a result of the pandemic, which has disproportionately hit low-wage workers and underserved populations. Senator Gillibrand has consistently fought to ensure New Yorkers can afford their utilities. When millions of workers were laid off at the beginning of the pandemic, New York and states across the country did not have sufficient funds to provide assistance to those losing their jobs. Senator Gillibrand fought alongside her colleagues to deliver $900 million in LIHEAP funding in the CARES Act. Gillibrand also successfully pushed the Trump administration to immediately release the emergency funding and send a vital lifeline to New Yorkers.MSTRUCK-7403375 MSTRUCK","As Senate Negotiates Coronavirus Relief Package, Sen.

Florida's resident death toll from coronavirus rose to 22,481 with the addition of 164 more reported fatalities on Thursday while also adding 19,816 more positive COVID-19 cases to bring the total to 1,429,722.
The nearly 20,000 cases is the largest single-day increase of infections reported by the state Department of Health, exceeding the previous record set one day earlier by more than 2,000. The state has not reported less than 10,000 new daily cases since Dec. 28.
With a population of about 21.5 million, about one in 15 people in the state have now been infected. That number is also near one in 15 nationally and one in 89 worldwide.
Deaths are also starting to surge to the levels seen in summer with 808 reported in the last seven days, an average of 115 a day. The largest single day of reported deaths, though, was Aug. 11 when the state listed 276 deaths. Those deaths, though, were from several previous days, as it can take weeks and sometimes several months for reports to appear.
With 336 non-Florida resident deaths, including 6 new reported Thursday, the state's combined total stands at 22,817.
Florida has seen about one in 955 of its residents die from the virus, while nationally it's closer to one in 907 people, and worldwide it's at about one in 4,127 of the planet's 7.8 billion population.
COVID-19 hospitalizations are climbing back up toward mid-July highs of over 8,000. They had fallen to around 2,000 by early October, but passed 7,000 this week.
Across the state, 7,335 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 as of about 2 p.m. Thursday including 404 in Orange County, 182 in Osceola, 173 in Lake and 133 in Seminole. The state's online tool updates several times throughout the day.
Over 132,474 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 across the United States as of Wednesday, according to COVID-19 Tracking Project, which updates its cumulative data once a day.
Vaccine efforts, though, hope to stem the rise in hospitalizations and fatalities. Statewide through Wednesday, 384,223 people have received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the DOH. A detailed breakdown of who has been vaccinated so far can be found here.
Cases continue to climb, and testing has ramped up. To date, 9,085,587 people have been tested in Florida, 61,990 more than Wednesday's total.
The positivity rate among those newly tested has climbed above 10% for seven days in row.
Statewide, the latest positivity rate reported Thursday for Wednesday's test results by the Florida Department of Health was 11.60%, but that's for new cases only and excludes anyone who previously tested positive. For all cases including retests of those previously infected, the latest positivity rate is 13.15%.
Central Florida added 3,848 cases on Thursday for a total of 242,421: That includes 1,307 more in Orange for 83,462; 622 more in Polk for 40,983; 456 in Osceola for 27,569; 348 in Volusia for 24,553; 434 in Brevard for 23,103; 264 in Seminole for 19,803; 331 in Lake for 17,228; and 86 in Sumter for 5,720.
There were 29 new deaths across all eight Central Florida counties bringing the region's toll to 3,670. Polk County has the most coronavirus fatalities in the region with 821, followed by 777 in Orange, 535 in Brevard, 460 in Volusia, 331 in Lake, 319 in Seminole, 305 in Osceola and 122 in Sumter.
Central Florida accounts for over 17% of the cases statewide and over 16% of the deaths.
South Florida, home to 29% of Florida's population, accounts for 39% of cases with 553,168. That includes 2,204 new cases reported Thursday among Miami-Dade, Broward, and Palm Beach counties.
South Florida's reported deaths rose by 54 for a total of 8,127, about 36% of the state's total.
The virus has infected over 87 million people and has killed nearly 1.9 million worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University & Medicine Coronavirus Resource Center.

561,"The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee issued the following testimony by National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony S. Fauci at a hearing entitled ""The Path Forward: A Federal Perspective on the COVID-19 Response"":* * *Thank you for the opportunity to discuss the role of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the research response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and its etiologic agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), NIAID is responsible for conducting and supporting basic and clinical research on emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, including COVID-19. As the Director of NIAID and the Chief Medical Advisor to the President, I am pleased to discuss NIAID's research addressing this pandemic.COVID-19 is a once-in-a-lifetime global infectious disease pandemic requiring an unprecedented public-private research effort. NIAID plays a central and important role in the public health response to COVID-19. NIAID has capitalized on decades of investment in fundamental basic research, including groundbreaking structure-based vaccine design at the NIAID Vaccine Research Center (VRC); engaged domestic and international research infrastructure; and leveraged highly productive partnerships with industry and longstanding relationships with community partners. NIAID utilized its existing domestic and international clinical trials infrastructure, originally established to conduct research on HIV and influenza, and worked with partners in the public and private sectors to establish the COVID-19 Prevention Network (CoVPN). The CoVPN has supported multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates to progress in record time from concept to authorization for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). NIAID also has built on its longstanding relationships with community partners to successfully conduct these crucial clinical trials. NIAID initiated clinical trials with creative and adaptive designs, allowing the evaluation of multiple new and existing therapeutics for use against COVID-19. Several of these trials provided evidence of safety and efficacy of COVID-19 therapeutics and helped support authorization by the FDA.These successes have helped slow the progression of the pandemic in the United States. Currently, more than 67% of U.S. adults have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and we must continue to vaccinate as many people as we can, as quickly as possible. FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccines meet FDA's rigorous standards for safety and efficacy. The high levels of vaccine efficacy observed in the carefully controlled conditions of clinical trials have been subsequently confirmed by their effectiveness in studies of vaccines administered to broad segments of the public in the United States and other countries. Vaccination and adherence to public health measures are the proven interventions that will be particularly important as we work to address the SARS-CoV-2 Delta (or B.1.617.2) variant and other variants with increased transmissibility or pathogenicity that may emerge.While we are cautiously optimistic about the future, we know that many challenges remain. One of the most concerning developments of the ongoing pandemic is the spread of variants of SARS-CoV-2 such as the Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. So far, scientific evidence suggests that the COVID-19 vaccines distributed in the United States under FDA Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) continue to be effective against severe disease caused by these variants, but we must remain vigilant. NIAID is rapidly conducting research to better understand these emerging variants, how they interact with the immune system, and their implications for COVID-19 therapeutic and vaccine formulations.We also know that our fellow Americans in underserved and minority communities have been disproportionally affected by this pandemic. NIAID is committed to continuing to work directly with these communities and partnering with other agencies in the federal government, and with industry and academia to ensure that nobody in vulnerable communities is left behind as we move forward towards defeating the COVID-19 pandemic. NIAID also recognizes that while many individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection fully recover after a relatively short time period, some individuals suffer longer-term effects after the initial phase of illness. NIAID is supporting collaborative efforts to study COVID-19 outcomes in patients across all ages, genders, and co-morbid conditions. These studies include people who experienced a broad range of COVID-19 disease severity so we can identify and characterize post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) and develop effective strategies to address them.Developing Vaccines and Monoclonal Antibodies to Prevent COVID-19Sustained research investments by NIAID in the years prior to the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 enabled the unprecedented pace of COVID-19 vaccine development. Two activities in particular predate successful COVID-19 vaccines: the development of versatile vaccine platforms and the adaptation of structural biology tools to design specific proteins (immunogens) that powerfully stimulate the immune system. Long before the pandemic, NIAID VRC scientists and their collaborators made the critical scientific discovery of how to stabilize--in a highly immunogenic form--viral proteins that are important for infection. These included the spike protein of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which was stabilized using a double mutation known as S2P. This key finding facilitated the design of vaccine candidates that generate robust immune responses not only against coronaviruses but also other viruses of public health importance such as respiratory syncytial virus. As soon as the sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was made available in January 2020, VRC researchers rapidly generated a stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein for use in COVID-19 vaccine development. This crucial breakthrough in structure-based vaccine design for coronaviruses led to the development of safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine candidates across a range of vaccine platforms.Six candidate COVID-19 vaccines have been or are in the process of being assessed in large-scale Phase 3 clinical trials in the United States thus far, and three have received EUAs from the FDA. Clinical trials to test COVID-19 vaccine candidates in pediatric populations are ongoing. On December 11, 2020, based on data from a Pfizer-supported Phase 3 clinical trial, an investigational vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech became the first to receive an EUA from the FDA for the prevention of COVID-19. This vaccine is now authorized for emergency use in individuals 12 years of age and older. NIAID has helped to advance five additional COVID-19 vaccine candidates through support for research on the foundational biology underlying the vaccine concepts, as well as for clinical testing through the CoVPN. Two of these vaccine candidates, those from Moderna, Inc., and Johnson & Johnson/Janssen, have received EUAs.Utilizing the CoVPN, NIAID is participating in the implementation of harmonized protocols to test investigational vaccines and preventive interventions against SARS-CoV-2. These protocols were developed in collaboration with the Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions and Vaccines (ACTIV) public-private partnership, vaccine manufacturers, and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). NIAID also supports the underlying critical infrastructure for these clinical trials, such as a common Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), an independent group that periodically reviews data from the ongoing trials to ensure the safety of study volunteers and to determine whether efficacy has been achieved. The CoVPN has enrolled tens of thousands of volunteers across the United States and internationally in clinical trials testing multiple investigational vaccines and monoclonal antibodies intended to protect people from COVID-19. The CoVPN also has developed an extensive community engagement framework to reach out to the underserved and minority communities disproportionally affected by COVID-19; to better understand their interest in, and concerns about, research participation; and to partner with them to ensure that their vital input is reflected in the conduct of these clinical studies.To further address the critical challenges of participation in clinical trials as well as vaccine acceptance and vaccine hesitancy, NIH established the Community Engagement Alliance Against COVID-19 Disparities (CEAL) initiative, led by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities. CEAL brings together trusted community leaders to serve as champions who share information about the importance of participating in COVID-19 research and communicate data on the safety and efficacy of authorized COVID-19 vaccines.mRNA-1273 (Moderna)As part of a longstanding collaboration, the NIAID VRC worked with the biotechnology company Moderna to develop a vaccine candidate designated mRNA-1273, which uses a messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine platform to express the stabilized SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Early clinical trials demonstrated that mRNA-1273 was generally well tolerated and induced robust immune responses in healthy adults. NIAID and BARDA then began working with Moderna on a Phase 3 clinical trial through the CoVPN that showed that mRNA-1273 was 94.1 percent efficacious in preventing symptomatic COVID-19. On December 18, 2020, after a thorough review of comprehensive data on mRNA-1273, the FDA issued an EUA for the mRNA-1273 vaccine for prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. In subsequent observational studies under ""real-world"" conditions in broader segments of the population, mRNA-based vaccines continue to display high levels of effectiveness. For example, in an article published in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) researchers and their collaborators showed that among health care personnel, first responders, and other essential workers, the mRNA-1273 and the Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine were 90 percent effective against SARS-CoV-2 infections 14 or more days after receiving a second dose. Other MMWR articles reported that these vaccines were 94 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19 among health care personnel and reduced the risk of COVID-19 hospitalization by 94 percent among people 65 years of age and older. Recently, NIAID scientists and their collaborators demonstrated that anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies persist for at least six months after the second dose of mRNA-1273. On June 26, 2021, FDA updated the EUAs for the Moderna and Pfizer COVID-19 vaccines to include information on the potential risks of myocarditis and pericarditis, particularly following the second dose. According to CDC, reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following vaccination with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are rare. Most patients who received care have responded well to treatment and rest, and patients usually can return to their normal daily activities after their symptoms improve. Given the significant potential health risk of COVID-19, the CDC continues to recommend that individuals ages 12 and older be vaccinated with the relevant FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine.Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen)Decades of NIAID support for basic, preclinical, and clinical research on adenovirus (Ad)-based HIV vaccines underpin the development by Johnson & Johnson/Janssen of a coronavirus vaccine candidate based on the Ad26-vector, known as Ad26.COV2.S or JNJ-78436735. NIAID is supporting a Phase 3 clinical trial of Ad26.COV2.S through the CoVPN and has provided immunological testing of the candidate using NIAID-funded core laboratory infrastructure. As reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, the one-dose vaccine candidate was 66 percent effective overall at preventing moderate to severe/critical COVID-19 occurring at least 28 days after vaccination and 85 percent effective overall in preventing severe/critical COVID-19 in the Phase 3 trial across several geographical regions, including areas where emerging viral variants predominate. In the United States, the efficacy against moderate to severe/critical disease 28 days after vaccination with Ad26.COV2.S was 72 percent. On February 27, 2021, the FDA issued an EUA for Ad26.COV2.S for prevention of COVID-19 in individuals 18 years of age and older. On April 13, 2021, out of an abundance of caution, the FDA and CDC released a joint statement recommending a pause in the use of Ad26.COV2.S in order to review extremely rare case reports of blood clots in combination with low blood platelets after vaccine administration. Medical and scientific teams at the FDA and CDC found that available data suggest that the chance of this serious adverse event occurring is very low. Following their thorough safety review - and in accordance with recommendations from the CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices - the FDA and CDC lifted the recommended pause on the use of Ad26.COV2.S on April 23, 2021. On July 12, 2021, FDA announced revisions to the vaccine recipient and caregivers and vaccination providers fact sheets for the Johnson & Johnson/Janssen COVID-19 vaccine regarding a suggested increased risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome during the 42 days following vaccination. The chance of this occurring following vaccination appears to be very low.Other COVID-19 Vaccine CandidatesNIAID, through the CoVPN, is supporting Phase 3 clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccine candidates from AstraZeneca (AZD1222) and Novavax (NVX-CoV2373). AstraZeneca's AZD1222 COVID-19 vaccine candidate uses a chimpanzee adenovirus-vectored vaccine approach developed by researchers at the University of Oxford in collaboration with scientists at NIAID's Rocky Mountain Laboratories. On March 25, 2021, AstraZeneca announced an updated interim analysis of AZD1222 reporting that the vaccine candidate was 76 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, including 85 percent effective in participants aged 65 years and over. Importantly, the efficacy of AZD1222 against severe COVID-19 disease was reported to be 100 percent. Novavax's NVX-CoV2373 COVID-19 vaccine candidate uses a protein nanoparticle vaccine approach. On June 14, 2021, Novavax announced that NVX-CoV2373 demonstrated 90.4 percent efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 and 100 percent protection against moderate and severe disease. In addition, the company reported that NVX-CoV2373 showed 91 percent efficacy in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 in people 65 years or older, as well as those with certain comorbidities or those who were identified as being likely to experience regular exposure to SARS-CoV-2. FDA has not yet authorized either of these vaccine candidates.Clinical Trials of COVID-19 Vaccine Candidates in Special PopulationsTo effectively end the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be important to vaccinate as many people as possible, including those in special populations, such as pregnant and lactating women, children, and people with immune deficiencies. More than 130,000 pregnant and lactating women already have received the COVID-19 vaccines under FDA EUAs, and early data are promising. These data do not demonstrate any safety concerns for women who are pregnant or their babies. In addition, protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 have been detected in babies born to pregnant women who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. On June 23, 2021, NIAID launched an observational study, MOMI-VAX, to evaluate the immune responses generated by COVID-19 vaccines administered to individuals during pregnancy or up to two months postpartum. The study also will assess vaccine safety and evaluate the transfer of vaccine-induced antibodies to infants across the placenta and through breast milk.Efforts to evaluate COVID-19 vaccines in pediatric and other special populations are ongoing. On March 16, 2021, Moderna, in collaboration with NIAID and BARDA, announced the launch of KidCOVE, a Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1273 in children ages 6 months to less than 12 years. This study is in addition to Moderna's ongoing TeenCOVE study of mRNA-1273 in adolescents between the ages of 12 and 17. On May 10, 2021, the FDA expanded the EUA for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine to include adolescents ages 12 to 15 years of age, and Pfizer also is evaluating their vaccine candidate in younger individuals. Other vaccine developers also have begun, or are planning to begin, trials to test their vaccine candidates in children, adolescents, and other special populations. On April 23, 2021, NIAID launched an observational study at the NIH Clinical Center assessing how people with immune system deficiencies or dysregulations respond to COVID-19 vaccination. NIAID investigators also will gather information about COVID-19 illness in these individuals. This study will inform decision-making about COVID-19 vaccination in people with immune deficiencies and dysregulation conditions.Monoclonal Antibodies to Prevent COVID-19NIAID, collaborating with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly and Company, also initiated two Phase 3 clinical trials to evaluate whether their investigational monoclonal antibodies, REGEN-COV and bamlanivimab respectively, can prevent infection or symptomatic disease in people at high risk of exposure due to their living or working conditions. Regeneron reported in a preprint publication that REGEN-COV prevented symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in household contacts of individuals who had recently tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Bamlanivimab also was reported to prevent symptomatic and asymptomatic infection in residents and staff of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities, and these findings were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. FDA has not yet authorized the use of either of these drugs for prevention of COVID-19. Clinical trials to test the safety and efficacy of monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of COVID-19 are being tested through the ACTIV partnership, and these are discussed below.Identifying Therapeutics to Treat COVID-19Safe and effective therapeutics are urgently needed to treat patients with COVID-19. NIAID has worked quickly from the earliest days of the pandemic to evaluate promising therapeutics for COVID-19 in rigorous, randomized, controlled clinical trials.The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment TrialNIAID launched a multicenter, randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial, the Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial (ACTT), to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple investigational therapeutics for COVID-19. ACTT-1 examined the antiviral drug remdesivir for treatment of severe COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. Based on positive data from ACTT-1, the FDA approved the use of remdesivir for treatment in adults and children 12 years of age and older and weighing at least 40 kg hospitalized due to COVID-19. ACTT-2 evaluated the anti-inflammatory drug baricitinib in combination with remdesivir, and based on favorable data from ACTT-2, the FDA issued an EUA for the use of baricitinib in combination with remdesivir for treatment of adults and children older than 2 years hospitalized with COVID-19 and requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. ACTT-3 currently is evaluating treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients with remdesivir plus interferon beta-1a, which is used to treat individuals with multiple sclerosis. ACTT-4, a study assessing baricitinib plus remdesivir versus the glucocorticoid dexamethasone plus remdesivir in adults hospitalized with COVID-19, has closed to enrollment because the study met pre-defined futility criteria.The ACTIV Public-Private PartnershipNIAID, in collaboration with other NIH Institutes, also launched two clinical trials as part of the ACTIV partnership, which utilizes master protocols allowing the addition of other investigational therapeutics as the trials continue. The two studies, ACTIV-2 and ACTIV-3, initially evaluated the use of the monoclonal antibody bamlanivimab to treat COVID-19 in outpatient and inpatient settings, respectively. ACTIV-2, which is focused on outpatients, has since been expanded to evaluate two combination monoclonal antibody therapies--BRII-196 plus BRII-198 and BMS-986414 plus BMS-986413--as well as four additional investigational therapeutics: SAB-185, a fully-human polyclonal antibody produced in cattle; SNG001, an inhalable beta interferon; and AZD7442, an investigational long-acting monoclonal antibody combination. Camostat mesilate, an orally administered drug that may block SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells, was evaluated but ultimately not included in ACTIV-2 efficacy studies, as it failed to induce early changes in viral shedding or improvement in symptoms. ACTIV-3 currently is evaluating the AZD7442 monoclonal antibody combination, as well as the small molecule ensovibep, in hospitalized patients. Ensovibep binds to several sites on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which may inhibit the virus's ability to infect human cells. On April 22, 2021, NIAID and NHLBI launched a new trial, known as ACTIV-3 Critical Care, to test Zyesami and remdesivir (alone and in combination), for their safety and efficacy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients who are experiencing acute respiratory distress syndrome, a life-threatening condition. Zyesami is a synthetic version of vasoactive intestinal peptide, which is made naturally in the human body and appears to have lung-protective antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects.Three monoclonal antibody therapies currently have FDA EUAs for the treatment of COVID-19 in outpatients. Due to concerns of variant resistance to monoclonal antibody therapies, the FDA now includes information on the susceptibility of SARS-CoV-2 variants in its fact sheets for health care providers for each of these therapies. NIAID-supported scientists and collaborators are evaluating the potential impact of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants on the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies.Additional NIAID-supported Therapeutics ActivitiesOn April 13, 2021, NIAID announced the launch of the COVID-19 anti-CD14 Treatment Trial (CaTT) to evaluate the use of a monoclonal antibody known as IC14 in adults hospitalized with COVID-19. IC14 works by binding to and blocking a human protein called CD14 that is associated with the development of severe inflammatory reactions in some COVID-19 patients. In addition, NIAID completed a Phase 3 trial called, ""Inpatient Treatment with Anti-Coronavirus Immunoglobulin,"" or ITAC, to evaluate hyperimmune intravenous immunoglobulin (hIVIG) for treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized adults. The study demonstrated that hIVIG plus remdesivir was not superior to remdesivir alone.NIAID also launched the ACTIV-5/Big Effect Trial (BET), which is designed to streamline the identification of experimental COVID-19 therapeutics that demonstrate the most promise. BET, an adaptive Phase 2 clinical trial, compares different investigational therapies to a common control arm to identify treatments with relatively large effects as promising candidates for further study in large-scale trials. BET initially is evaluating two therapeutics: risankizumab, an immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and AbbVie, which is FDA-approved for the treatment of severe plaque psoriasis; and lenzilumab, an investigational immunomodulatory monoclonal antibody developed by Humanigen.NIH recently launched the Antiviral Program for Pandemics, a collaboration between NIH and BARDA that aims to develop safe and effective antivirals to treat and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. The program also will build sustainable platforms for targeted drug discovery and development of antivirals directly targeting viruses with pandemic potential. As part of this effort, NIAID will establish Antiviral Drug Discovery Centers for Pathogens of Pandemic Concern. These multidisciplinary research centers will create platforms that will initially target coronaviruses, and then could be expanded to other viruses with pandemic potential - helping to better prepare the nation for future viral threats.The NIH also has established the COVID-19 Treatment Guidelines Panel to provide recommendations to health care providers regarding specific COVID-19 treatments based on the best available science. The Guidelines also address considerations for special populations, including pregnant women and children. Each Treatment Guidelines section is developed by a working group of Panel members with expertise in the area addressed in the specific section; these members conduct systematic, comprehensive reviews of relevant information and scientific literature. The Panel comprises representatives of NIH and five other federal agencies along with representatives of nine professional organizations, academic experts, and treating physicians including providers from high COVID-19 incidence areas, and community representatives. The Panel meets regularly to evaluate possible treatment options for COVID-19 and update the Treatment Guidelines as new clinical evidence emerges.Responding to Emerging Variants of SARS-CoV-2NIAID is fully engaged in efforts to mitigate the potential impact of emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. NIH, including NIAID, participates in the HHS-established SARS-CoV-2 Interagency Group, along with CDC, FDA, BARDA, the Department of Defense (DOD), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to address the potential impact of emerging variants on critical SARS-CoV-2 countermeasures. NIH, CDC, and DOD are assessing whether vaccine-induced immunity, or natural immunity from prior infection, can be effective in combating the variants. NIH, BARDA, and DOD also are determining the efficacy of certain authorized therapeutics against emerging variants in cell lines in vitro and in animal models.NIAID is collaborating with vaccine manufacturers on key areas of research to investigate whether vaccines designed for the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 can maintain efficacy against emerging variants. NIAID also is conducting and supporting comprehensive studies to understand the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize the variant viruses. NIAID researchers have analyzed the immune responses of individuals who recovered from COVID-19 prior to the emergence of variants and demonstrated that their T cells - a key component of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 - also were capable of recognizing the three most widespread SARS-CoV-2 variants at the time, Alpha (also known as B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), and Gamma (P1). These findings, published in Open Forum Infectious Diseases, shed new light on the role of T cells in the development of immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and suggest that these cells also may help protect against emerging variants of concern. On March 25, 2021, NIAID launched a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy adults to assess the safety and immunogenicity of second-generation COVID-19 vaccine candidates developed by Gritstone Oncology, Inc. Gritstone's COVID-19 vaccine candidates utilize a strategy aimed at inducing both neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses to elicit a broad immune response. This approach could provide protection against emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants by targeting several viral antigens, all of which are highly conserved among viral strains.NIAID also plans to test new vaccine formulations that may protect against certain variants that show early indications of reduced sensitivity to existing countermeasures. On March 31, 2021, NIAID launched a Phase 1 clinical trial of an investigational Moderna vaccine based on its FDA-authorized COVID-19 vaccine, designed specifically to target the Beta (B.1.351) SARS-CoV-2 variant first detected in South Africa. NIAID and Moderna are evaluating this vaccine candidate as a precautionary measure as we gain more data to confirm that current vaccines provide an adequate degree of protection against currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. In addition, NIAID is leading a study in fully vaccinated individuals to determine the safety and efficacy of boosting with a COVID-19 vaccine different than the one used for the initial vaccination. The results of this trial are intended to inform public health policy decisions on the potential use of mixed vaccine schedules should booster doses be needed.NIAID, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and the National Library of Medicine are participating in the SARS-CoV-2 Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology, and Surveillance (SPHERES) initiative. SPHERES is a national genomics consortium led by CDC that helps to coordinate SARS-CoV-2 sequencing across the United States. NIAID is working with partners to identify, monitor, and calculate the frequency of current variations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome to help predict emerging variants. NIAID also facilitates the use of cutting-edge modeling and structural biology tools to understand how variants might affect interactions between the virus and the immune system or COVID-19 therapeutics. NIAID scientists are helping to inform our understanding of transmissibility of the variants by studying their stability in the environment of infected individuals and their ability to grow in human lung cells. These efforts add to a growing body of knowledge about SARS-CoV-2 variants and our ability to combat them.Understanding the Immunology and Pathogenesis of COVID-19NIH is supporting studies to understand the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in specific populations, including children, as well as certain aspects of the clinical course of infection, including thromboses, strokes, heart attacks, and other sequelae of infection. NIAID is working with partners to delineate biological and immune pathways responsible for the varied manifestations of COVID-19. NIAID also will examine the quality and durability of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2; this information may be leveraged to develop novel SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics or vaccines and inform public health measures.NIAID, along with FDA, is supporting a National Cancer Institute (NCI) effort to determine the sensitivity and specificity of certain SARS-CoV-2 serological tests, which can detect antibodies indicative of a prior exposure to SARS-CoV-2. NCI and NIAID also are working to establish a collaborative network to increase national capacity for high-quality serological testing with rapid return-of-results to subjects. These efforts include the use of serological testing to support clinical trials of convalescent serum and the establishment of registries for seroprotection studies.Early in the pandemic, the intramural research programs of NIAID, NCI, the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering partnered to rapidly deploy the SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic Serosurvey. The study investigated whether adults in the United States without a confirmed history of SARS-CoV-2 infection have antibodies to the virus, thus indicating prior infection. Findings from the first time point of this longitudinal study suggest that the prevalence of COVID-19 in the United States during the spring and summer of 2020 may have far exceeded the number of cases medically diagnosed. Extrapolating from analyses of blood samples from people who did not have a previously diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infection, along with socioeconomic, health, and demographic data, the researchers estimate that there may have been an additional 16.8 million undiagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infections through mid-July 2020. Continued analysis of the 1-year follow-up data from the study will be very important in better understanding mortality rates, prevalence of immunity, and the impact SARS-CoV-2 has had on various communities in the United States.NIAID scientists are participating in leadership of the COVID Human Genetic Effort, an international consortium of hospitals and genetic sequencing hubs that aim to discover genetic factors conferring resistance to SARS-CoV-2 infection or predisposing to severe COVID-19 disease. The consortium has identified a subgroup of patients with severe COVID-19 that have ineffective immune responses to SARS-CoV-2, some of whom have identifiable mutations in key immune pathways. NIAID also supports efforts to understand the rare, but extremely serious, multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) that has been associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection in children and adolescents. NIAID hosted a virtual workshop on MIS-C with scientists and clinicians from academia, NIH, FDA, and industry, and a report of the workshop recommendations was published on November 2, 2020. NIAID also supports the Pediatric Research Immune Network on SARS-CoV-2 and MIS-C (PRISM) to evaluate acute and long-term clinical and immunological effects of MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2 infection in children. In addition, NIAID is collaborating with Children's National Medical Center to follow 1,000 children with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including those with MIS-C, to determine long-term effects of the illness. NIAID is participating in a trans-NIH effort to coordinate MIS-C research led by NHLBI and the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. This centralized effort, the Collaboration to Assess Risk and Identify Long-term Outcomes for Children with COVID (CARING for Children with COVID), will permit data to be shared across studies to determine the spectrum of illness and predict long-term consequences of infection.Monitoring the Long-term Effects of COVID-19Many people who have had COVID-19 experience continued symptoms or other sequelae as they transition from the acute to post-acute phases of the disease, and we continue to learn more about the duration and manifestations of COVID-19 as we hear from these patients. In December 2020, NIAID hosted a Workshop on Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 with clinicians, immunologists, virologists, and members of the patient community to present existing data, identify key knowledge gaps, and explore different perspectives on this heterogeneous condition. A report from this workshop highlighting the key scientific questions and knowledge gaps regarding PASC was recently published in the Annals of Internal Medicine. NIH has announced the Researching COVID to Enhance Recovery (RECOVER) Initiative, a trans-NIH effort to address PASC, including targeted funding for research in this critical area. The NIH RECOVER Initiative will complement ongoing NIAID studies to better understand the various post-acute manifestations of COVID-19 in various populations.NIAID intramural scientists initiated the Longitudinal Study of COVID-19 Sequelae and Immunity to better understand PASC and determine whether people who have recovered from acute SARS-CoV-2 infection develop an immune response to SARS-CoV-2 that provides protection against reinfection. NIAID-supported investigators also have established the Immunophenotyping Assessment in a COVID-19 Cohort (IMPACC) to determine how immunological markers correspond to, or may even predict, the clinical severity of COVID-19. Since May 1, 2020, IMPACC researchers have collected detailed clinical data along with blood and respiratory samples from more than 1,200 hospitalized COVID-19 patients of diverse race and ethnicity at approximately 20 hospitals nationwide. The cohort will be followed during hospitalization and up to one year after discharge to assess their functional and immunologic recovery.ConclusionNIAID continues to expand efforts to elucidate the biology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including emerging variants, and to employ this knowledge to develop safe and effective interventions to diagnose, treat, and prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19. NIAID is focused on developing safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and therapeutics and sensitive, specific, rapid point-of-care molecular diagnostic and serological tests. NIAID also is conducting early-stage research on candidate vaccines that could protect against multiple strains of coronaviruses. All these efforts will improve our response to the current pandemic and bolster our preparedness for the next, inevitable viral disease outbreak.T40-MgEditor-7560969 T40-MgEditor",Senate Health Committee Issues Testimony From National Institute of Allergy &amp; Infectious Diseases
569,"Mar. 4 - The top-seeded Dayton Flyers survived an upset attempt by No. 9 Davidson on Friday in the quarterfinals of the Atlantic 10 Conference tournament.
Makira Cook made a tie-breaking 3-pointer with 1:41 to play in overtime and then made two free throws with 59 seconds to play, and Kyla Whitehead sealed a 60-55 victory by making two free throws with 12 seconds remaining at the Chase Fieldhouse in Wilmington, Del.
Dayton (24-4) will play No. 4 seed Virginia Commonwealth (22-7) a.m. Saturday in the semifinals. That game will air on the CBS Sports Network. The winner will play at 2 p.m. Sunday in the A-10 championship game, which will air on ESPN2.
VCU beat No. 12 George Washington 55-47 in the second quarterfinal Friday.
VCU beat Dayton 60-58 at UD Arena on Feb. 13. That was Dayton's only A-10 loss. Dayton did not play GW in the regular season. The game was postponed because of COVID-19 issues.
This will be the fourth straight season the teams have played in the A-10 tournament. VCU beat Dayton 56-50 in the A-10 semifinals last season on its home court, the Siegel Center, in Richmond, Va. Two years ago, Dayton beat VCU 52-48 at UD Arena in the A-10 championship game. In 2019, Dayton lost 61-52 to No. 1 seed VCU in the A-10 semifinals in Pittsburgh.
Cook led the Flyers with 14 points on 5-of-17 shooting. Whitehead and Tenin Magassa each scored 10. Erin Whalen and Mariah Perez each had eight. Araion Bradshaw led Dayton with 13 rebounds.
Both teams shot below 40 percent from the field and below 20 percent from 3-point range. Dayton outscored Davidson 18-6 at the free-throw line.
Davidson opened the game with a 6-0 run in the first three minutes. Dayton rallied to tie the game with 21 seconds left in the quarter on a layup by Makira Cook. A 3-pointer by Sarah Konstans with four seconds left in the quarter gave Davidson a 13-10 lead going to the second quarter.
Davidson scored the first four points of the second quarter to take a 17-10 lead but didn't score in the last seven minutes of the quarter. Dayton went on a 12-0 run to take a 22-17 halftime lead. Whalen scored nine points in the run.
Dayton also scored the first seven points of the third quarter to extend its run to 19-0 in a 9 1/2 -minute span. The Flyers led by as many as 14 points in the third quarter and owned 40-29 lead at the end of the quarter.
Davidson got back in the game with a 10-1 run to start the fourth quarter. It was a close game from that point. Dayton led 48-44 entering the final two minutes only to have Davidson tie the game on a layup by Elle Sutphin with 42 seconds left.

570,"Publication: The Duke Chronicle, , Duke University , Durham, NCIt was midnight when first-year Christina Yoh saw a text in a group chat. It was her friend telling everyone to make a vaccine appointment because she had just scheduled one.
“I frantically logged onto my computer, created a Walgreens account and clicked the first appointment I saw because I didn’t want to miss my chance,” Yoh said.
Duke announced last week that students would be eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine starting April 1. However, the announcement noted that students might experience delays in scheduling appointments at Duke Health due to “uncertainties in the supply chain.” As a result, Duke encouraged students to explore vaccination options outside of the University.
Now, many students have been receiving their COVID-19 vaccinations in a variety of ways.
Some students simply waited at nearby Walgreens locations in hopes of receiving extra vaccines at the end of the day.
“Two Saturdays ago, my friend and I decided to just go to the nearest Walgreens without an appointment,” first-year William King said. “I think they happened to have extra doses, so they gave me one. Honestly, I just got super lucky.”
Others received vaccines through Walgreens by making an appointment on the pharmacy’s website. In North Carolina, the first portion of Group 4 became eligible to receive the vaccine on March 17, including those who live in “certain congregate settings.” Students living in on-campus housing took advantage of this policy.
Students who made vaccination appointments online had several Walgreens locations to choose from. Yoh chose the Walgreens on North Lasalle Street, a 10 minute drive from East Campus.
She brought her passport and health insurance card, and at the counter, she received a form to fill out. The Walgreens employees called people one by one into a small room to get the jab, she said.
“I was worried that I wouldn’t be able to get the vaccine since I’m not from the U.S., but they really didn’t care,” said Yoh, who is from Singapore. “I never thought I’d get vaccinated this semester, let alone in the U.S.”
Lucky students like Yoh were able to reserve vaccination slots at Walgreens locations close to campus. Others went to great lengths to get the vaccine. Junior Sarabesh Natarajan was able to receive his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine as early as February by driving to a site in Cabarrus County, which is two hours away from Durham.
“In Durham County and Wake County—where my sister is right now for college—the demand for vaccines was just so high,” Natarajan said. “They were backed up in terms of the number of healthcare workers in Group 1 that had to get vaccinated.”

The site in Cabarrus County was a drive-through clinic. Natarajan said that all he had to do was roll down his windows to get the injection.
“I know some other friends who also drove two to three hours to random places just to get the vaccine,” said Natarajan, adding that he even drove a friend to one of these clinics.
Aside from Walgreens, some students employed by Duke were eligible to receive the COVID-19 vaccine through Duke Health.
Sophomore Maile Lehrer is a resident assistant in the Gilbert-Addoms dorm on East Campus. She was vaccinated on March 9 through Duke, and some of her friends have also gotten vaccines in various ways.
“I actually took one of my friends to get vaccinated—it was a very different experience,” Lehrer recalled. “She signed up on a waiting list, and they called her back. It was organized, but definitely not hospital-grade organized.”

575,"Jan. 12Levels of new COVID-19 cases remained lower today than peaks last week, but deaths from the virus increased to levels last seen a week ago.
It was unclear if the numbers indicate trends, though on Monday state Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine cautioned Thursday and Friday mark two weeks after New Year's celebrations and that could mean higher case numbers soon.
For the third day in a row, the state Department of Health reported fewer than 10,000 cases after reporting 10,000-plus cases Friday and Saturday. The 7,275 new cases raised the state total to 733,429.
For the third day in a row, the seven-county Northeast Pennsylvania region reported fewer than 600 cases after reporting more than 600 on Friday and Saturday. The 420 new cases brought the total to 43,611 cases across Lackawanna, Luzerne, Monroe, Pike, Susquehanna, Wayne and Wyoming counties.
The state reported 227 new deaths, raising the total to 18,080.  The number fell between the new death totals reported Friday, 215, and Saturday, 273.
Regionally, 14 new deaths  including six each in Lackawanna and Luzerne counties  pushed the local total to 1,149.
That was one death shy of the 15 reported Saturday.
Locally:
Lackawanna added 143 cases for 10,462 total, including 1,320 probable, The new deaths raised the county total to 288.
Luzerne added 115 cases for 19,723 total, including 1,276 probable. The new deaths raised the county total to 506.
Monroe added 81 cases for 7,244 total, including 161 probable. One new death raised the county's total to 218.
Pike added 36 cases for 1,756 total, including 124 probable, and remained at 36 deaths.
Susquehanna added 15 cases for 1,227 total, including 112 probable, and remained at 41 deaths.
Wayne added 24 cases for 2,281 total, including 181 probable. One new death raised the county total to 28.
Wyoming added six cases for 918 total, including 156 probable, and remained at 32 deaths.

577,"
Connecticut's economy, helped by government checks and a productive manufacturing sector, grew at a healthy, but still relatively weak, annual rate of 6% in the first three months of the year, the U.S. Commerce Department reported Friday.
As businesses and consumers emerge from the economic wreckage caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Connecticut's growth lagged the the overall U.S. growth rate of 6.4% compared to the last quarter of 2020. Connecticut ranked No. 34 among all states for growth.
Among New England states, only Maine had a slower growth rate. Nationally, economic expansion ranged from 10.9% in Nevada to 2.9% in Washington, D.C.
Connecticut's $294.5 billion economy in the January-March period was the second largest in New England, after Massachusetts. But in New England, only Maine's economy grew more slowly, at 5.2%. Vermont barely edged out Connecticut, posting a 6.1% rate of growth.
""The increases in first-quarter Gross Domestic Product by state reflected the continued economic recovery, reopening of establishments and continued government response related to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" the Commerce Department said.
Economic growth was helped in part by government assistance, such as direct economic impact payments, expanded unemployment benefits and Paycheck Protection Program loans, the Commerce Department said. The full economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be quantified because the impacts cannot be separately identified, the government said.
Connecticut's venerable manufacturing and finance and insurance sectors contributed the most to the state's economic growth. A jump in retail reflecting renewed interest by consumers in shopping as malls and downtown stores reopened after being shut for months also helped propel economic growth.
The release of the economic growth data follows by just three days another Commerce Department report showing Connecticut was last among the states in personal income growth between the end of 2020 and the beginning of this year. The 42% rise in personal income - salaries, wages, dividends and other forms of income in addition to government pandemic relief - was significant. But it was outpaced by every other state.
Nationally, personal income was up 59.7%.
Fred Carstensen, a University of Connecticut economics professor and director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, posted on his LinkedIn account that the state has the ""worst performing economy among all 50 states - dead last.""
""It never recovered in jobs or real output from 2008; it disconnected from the national economy,"" he said.
Connecticut's unemployment rate, a driver in economic growth and personal income, was 7.7% in May, significantly higher than the 5.8% U.S. rate. Jobs are up more than 18,000 so far this year and the unemployment rate is lower than it was more than five years after the start of the Great Recession of 2008, said Patrick Flaherty, research director at the Connecticut Department of Labor.
However, economist Don Klepper-Smith said Connecticut was poised for full jobs recovery before the pandemic last year. After COVID-19, the state was 150,000 jobs away from full recovery, he said.
The state will not return to its employment peak of 1.72 million ""any time soon,"" Klepper-Smith said.

578,"Kyle Lamont spent a little over a year doing interviews, seeing shows and visiting venues to prepare for the launch of her podcast all about live music in March. Then all of a sudden, live music didn't exist.
""It was way too tumultuous to release a podcast about the world of live music, especially while venues were and are still suffering,"" said Lamont, who added that was it was also tricky to create a marketing plan around something so delicate. So, she waited until June and dropped all 15 episodes of Season 1 at once. Season 2 launched on Jan. 19 with new episodes rolling out on Tuesdays.
Concert Cast is a comprehensive and entertaining field guide to the live music experience, served up in 20- to 35-minute episodes. It features interviews with local musicians, like Angelikah Fahray and Ben Cosgrove, and explores Maine venues, including Eureka Hall in Stockholm, The Pickled Wrinkle in Prospect Harbor and State Theatre in Portland.
Each episode is engaging, informative and bursting with enthusiasm about everything music-related. During an episode recorded at the King Pine Room at Sugarloaf, Lamont chatted with the band Ghost of Paul Revere and shared some theories about the origins of artist dressing rooms being referred to as green rooms. One possibility was that they were filled with plants that lent moisture to singers' voices, she said she discovered in her online research.
In another episode of Concert Cast, you'll find Lamont in Belfast during the two-day All Roads Music Festival of 2019. Her attention to detail is acute as she describes wiping away the ""web of ocean mist that's caught in my eyelashes"" and walking up Belfast's Main Street which she says feels like being inside a postcard with its pre-Civil War architecture. Lamont meets up with the festival's director, Meg Shorette, and the two chat vibrantly about their love of Belfast and their even bigger love for live music.
Lamont lives in the Down East town of Sullivan, and her studio is in Ellsworth. Her childhood was spent in Maine, as well as Phoenix, Arizona. In high school, the Maine Community Foundation awarded Lamont a four-year Guy P. Gannett scholarship for journalism, and she graduated from the University of Missouri where she majored in English. She also wrote for the college newspaper and interned and later worked at the ABC affiliate news station where she produced, wrote, edited and filmed segments. She also worked at a local music venue called The Blue Note which was her foray into the world of concerts and touring. After graduation, Lamont spent time living in New York City, North Carolina and overseas in Amsterdam. She considers the road her home, but also refers to herself as a ""bona-fide boomeranger.""
Lamont is the creative director and owner of Good To Go Studios, a boutique production agency in Ellsworth that specializes in commercials, short films and podcasts. Before the COVID-induced lockdown, she was traveling for work to places like Romania to all over the U.S., including San Francisco, New York City, Seattle and Salt Lake City.
Lamont originally wanted to do a filmed series about concert culture, but the overhead costs and limitations steered her toward the world of podcasting. She soon found it was an effective way to share her love for traveling the state to see live music. ""It's a chance for me to create a shared experience. With a podcast, people are able to sink into the episode, they're not scrolling or distracted. People commit to listening, and people listen with their heart and imagination.""
I've long wondered about the ins and outs of podcasting and Lamont broke it down succinctly. ""Starting a podcast is actually accessible and affordable, which is one reason we are seeing a huge increase in shows. Keeping a podcast on air is another story. It's all about the hats and how quickly you can pass them off."" Lamont also said financing is essential and that sponsorship dollars translate to being able to expand the team with writers, editors, producers and hosts. ""A team means more creative brain power to create great content quicker. Personally, the production side is a natural fit for me, and my biggest challenge is getting the podcast in front of the right ears.""
Lamont wouldn't say how many listeners she has, but said she knows that most of her audience listens all the way through episodes, which she said is ""very encouraging.""
So how did Lamont get into live music in the first place? It started with an MC Hammer and Salt-N-Pepa concert in Phoenix when she was 8 years old. ""I was with my parents, and I remember dancing on top of my seat and being dazzled by the bright costumes and choreography."" About five years later, as an eight grader, her father drove Lamont and some friends from Sullivan to Boston to see Fiona Apple at the Orpheum. ""We had balcony seats, and I remember being wowed by the theater. I had never experienced something so grand before.""
The lack of live performances right now has given Lamont a lot to miss - and a lot to say about it.
""Concerts are kinetic. The way they ignite energy before you even get to the show and how that energy stays with you after the show while bragging - or simply working at your desk. I miss that energy, it is so inspiring,"" Lamont said. She also spoke of missing the anticipation, the random bathroom conversations with fellow concert goers and feeling the bass throb beneath her feet.
""I miss talking with people under the marquee, especially the one at State, about the show we just saw, and reviewing the performance as if we are sportscasters. I miss the feeling of walking into a venue and knowing that I will be untethered for three hours. I miss disappearing in the music only to come out renewed. So, yeah, I miss the whole live music experience.""
Me too, Kyle, me too. But keeping the podcast going has helped.
""Season 2 of Concert Cast is my way of staying connected, raising awareness and keeping an eye on the future of concert culture. I know my appreciation for what we had and what we will have when concerts come back will be amplified for sure. This medium has been a gift and I only hope that I can continue expanding the vision and growing  the audience! I hope everyone who listens can hear a bit of themself in the show.""
Concert Cast is available wherever you listen to podcasts.

581,"Warren De La Salle will likely lament the entire offseason four fourth-down conversion attempts that failed against Muskegon Mona Shores during a 25-19 loss in the Division 2 finalon Friday afternoon at Ford Field.
The Pilots had three drives stall on downs inside the Mona Shores 34-yard line.
De La Salle was stopped on downs at the Mona Shores 30- and 34-yard lines in the second quarter, and then after moving the ball to the Mona Shores 33, the Pilots faced a fourth-and-5 to start the fourth quarter.
The conversion failed and Mona Shores took over at its own 31-yard line.
On the strength of a 65-yard run by Brady Rose, Mona Shores then drove down the field and took a 19-7 lead with 9:25 remaining on a 10-yard touchdown run by Keondre Pierce.
Trailing 19-14, De La Salle then decided to go for a first down facing fourth-and-3 from its own 39, but an incomplete pass deep down the middle of the field gave the ball back to Mona Shores with 5:02 remaining.
""We said all week we were going to get some shots and some opportunities,"" De La Salle head coach Dan Rohn said. ""We missed that pass at the end. It was something we had been setting up. We barely missed it and if we score there, maybe it's a different outcome. But we went against one of the best football teams in the state of Michigan.""
Mona Shores finally gets best of De La Salle, follows trend
This was the third time since 2014 that Mona Shores and De La Salle played in the Division 2 state championship game.
De La Salle won the other meetings in 2014 (44-8) and 2018 (29-16), but Mona Shores won the third meeting, 25-19, and in the process, kept up a trend of repeat champions in Division 2.
Mona Shores followed in the footsteps of Detroit King in 2016 and De La Salle in 2018 by repeating as state champions.
""We'll probably be the only Division 2 state champions for the month of January in history for the rest of football,"" Mona Shores head coach Matt Koziak quipped.
Centreville adjusts after unexpected bye week
Of the 16 teams competing at the state football finals this weekend, Centreville was the only one that entered coming off, essentially, a bye week.
Not that the Bulldogs wanted it that way.
Centreville would've loved to have celebrated advancing to the Division 8 final on the field after a semifinal win, but that didn't happen after Clarkston Everest Collegiate had to forfeit its semifinal matchup with Centreville two days prior to the game due to COVID-19 issues.
After finding out it was headed to the final for the first time ever via a phone call, Centreville started its preparation.
""We were already on the practice field preparing,"" Centreville head coach Jerry Schultz said of when the team found out. ""There is good and bad. It's good because you can rest, but with our offense that we play and the mesh points, there's a lot of timing. When you don't get that game speed, that can be rough. And, you can tell that in the first half that playing indoors was a lot different. We were a lot more tired than we have been in previous games. Last week, if we could've played at the Legacy Center (in Brighton vs. Everest Collegiate), we could've gotten a little more adapted to it.""
Fortunately for Centreville, it adjusted to the bye and indoor conditions just fine in a 22-0 shutout of Ubly for its first state title.
Offense dooms Ubly
Ubly head coach Eric Sweeney knew Centreville mirrored his team, in that it liked to feature a ball-control offense.
While praising a Centreville defense that recorded its seventh shutout and the way its offense controlled the ball, Sweeney said his team running just 10 plays and gaining 24 yards of offense was the biggest culprit for the Bearcats' 16-0 deficit at halftime and loss.
""When you only run 10 plays in the first half, that's not ball-control offense,"" Sweeney said. ""Our defense never got a rest because we played bad offense.""

582,"BOSTON —This was indeed a long time coming for the 76ers.
Tuesday’s 106-96 victory over the Boston Celtics at TD Garden enabled them to sweep the season series with their archrivals for the first time since the 2000-01 season and the fourth time overall.
“I didn’t know that,” Sixers coach Doc Rivers said of the milestone. “This is one of the teams ... whether we swept them or not, the last three years they’ve been in the top of the East. So it’s great that we did it. It gives us a lot of confidence.
“Having said that, we’re not finished yet. I would say that. We still have work to do.”
In the process, Joel Embiid had 35 points and six rebounds in his second game back from a left knee bone bruise. He made 16 of 20 fouls shots.
“He had great rhythm today,” Rivers said. “And I thought he was very patient, too. I thought our passing when they doubled [him] was fantastic.
“They almost got in a pick-your-poison spot. That’s what we want Joel to be.”
This performance came after Embiid finished with 24 points, 8 rebounds, 2 assists, and 3 blocks in Saturday’s victory over the Minnesota Timberwolves after missing 10 games. The MVP candidate showed rust in that game.
On Tuesday, he was dissatisfied with missing four free throws, telling TNT “too many misses” and “I should be a 90% free throw shooter.”
But was indeed a milestone against Boston.
This Sixers also prevailed 117-109 on Jan. 20 and 122-110 on Jan. 22 against the Celtics at the Wells Fargo Center. Due to a shortened schedule, teams are playing interconference opponents three times this season instead of four.
Philly came close to accomplishing that feat last season. The Sixers won the first three meetings before losing the fourth and final game. Then the Celtics went on to sweep them in the first round of the playoffs.
But both teams are distinctly different from the end of last season.
Back then, the Sixers were a team in disarray.
Now at 35-16, they’re tied with the Brooklyn Nets atop the Eastern Conference standings. Meanwhile, the Celtics (25-26) look nothing like the squad that reached last season’s conference finals. One could argue a lot of that has to do with their having key players sidelined this season due to testing positive for COVID-19 or contacting tracing.
Things apparently aren’t getting better.
Celtics guard Evan Fournier missed Tuesday’s game due to being in the NBA’s COVID-19 protocols. Fournier, who was acquired from the Orlando Magic on March 25, will likely be out all week.
Center Tristan Thompson, who had COVID, has been cleared to return after being sidelined since March 11. But he missed Tuesday’s game while being in the league’s reconditioning program.
On this night, the Celtics used various centers.
Robert Williams III, who at 6-foot-8, got the start against the 7-2 Embiid. He didn’t provide much resistance, while picking up three first-quarter fouls. Williams eventually fouled out with 9:29 remaining.
Luke Kornet, at 7-foot-2, was the sixth man. Then Mo Wagner (6-11) and Tacko Fall (7-5) all came in. Power forward Semi Ojeleye (6-6) even guarded him late.
Embiid had 12 points on 3-for-5 shooting while making all six of his foul shots in 10 minutes, 28 seconds during the first quarter. He had only three points on 1-for-4 shooting in the second quarter.
Fall came in for Kornet for the final 3:13 of the half. With him in the game, Embiid settled for and missed two three-pointers before intermission.
But Embiid went back to playing at a high level in the third quarter, scoring 11 points on 3-for-5 shooting. The Sixers built a commanding 21-point lead (79-58) on Ben Simmons’ layup with 5:01 left in the third quarter. That basket came on an assist from Embiid.
The big fella went on to add nine points in the fourth.
“Walking out, he turned to me and said, ‘I’m back,’ ” Rivers said of Embiid. “And I said, ‘Yeah, I noticed.’ ”
Danny Green (17 points, 5-for-6 on three-pointers), Simmons (12 points), Tobias Harris (10 points, eight rebounds) and Furkan Korkmaz (10 points) were the Sixers’ other double-digit scorers.
Jayson Tatum paced the Celtics with 20 points. Jaylen Brown added 17.

583,"All public health interventions have a public health cost, and masking our children – especially very young ones – against COVID-19 is no exception. That's why the new school reopening guidelines announced Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are a big step in the right direction.
The agency says masks are unnecessary for fully vaccinated students, teachers and staff, as long as they can maintain 3 feet of distancing, and recommends continued indoor masking and distancing for those who are unvaccinated. I agree with this as long as it doesn't lead to mask mandates for young children, who are not yet eligible for vaccines.
Dr. Daniel Benjamin, Duke professor of pediatrics and principal investigator of multiple studies on the risk of COVID-19 transmission in schools, told me that that risk of spread has been shown to be less than 1% in school studies in North Carolina, Utah and Nebraska, and that mask wearing plays a significant role in decreasing this transmission. This is important in areas of increasing community spread, especially due to the delta variant.
On the other hand, regular mask use in children is far from risk-free, especially in circumstances when the masks are not frequently changed or worn properly. With 67% of American adults having received a shot of a COVID-19 vaccine and close to 50% being fully vaccinated, now is not the time for a pervasive across the board mask mandate for our children.
Consider that a survey in Germany of over 25,000 children determined that 68% had trouble managing nose and mouth coverings. And a Polish/German study just published in the prominent journal JAMA Pediatrics examining 45 children determined that the carbon dioxide level was at least three times greater than the upper limit determined as safe (2000 ppm) by the German Federal Environmental office. The study concluded that ""most of the complaints reported by children can by understood as consequences of elevated carbon dioxide levels in inhaled air.""
Some critics have said the study design was flawed. Still, a study from Singapore back in April also showed that carbon dioxide content increases with face mask use. And last year, a study of 343 health professionals on the front lines in New York City determined that prolonged mask use led to headaches, rashes, skin breakdown, impaired cognition, or other adverse affects in a majority of those studied.
Beyond that, young children have trouble reading faces and learning unspoken behavior with masks on, especially following more than a year of remote learning and diminished socialization experiences.
The country is deeply divided on mask mandates, which is reflected in a patchwork of rules and options. There has been disturbing inconsistency from state to state and little correlation between vaccine compliance, case numbers, the emergence of the delta variant, or whether there is a resistance to mask mandates.
The CDC guidance should cut down on state and local school mask policies that are driven by politics rather than by science. For example, masks for schoolchildren are optional in New York State, but have been mandatory in New York City, despite extremely low case rates.
There is simply no overriding public health reason for mask mandates in all schools, despite the delta variant, especially at a time when hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have dropped dramatically in the U.S. Though some estimates show that the percentage of COVID-19 cases among children is increasing, almost all cases remain mild or asymptomatic. Certainly, rapid testing and screening can remain in place for young children next year.
All three vaccines currently available are effective against the delta variant. Any teacher or school staff who feels concerned about COVID-19 risk can simply be vaccinated, and that goes for every child from the age of 12 and up.
The CDC guidance leaves the door open to mask mandates for students too young to be vaccinated, but I hope state and local leaders do not take this path. Our children have suffered enough.
Based on current science, I vote yes on CDC guidance and no on mandatory masks in schools. Masks for kids may be recommended, but not forced. If your young child is immunocompromised or has a chronic medical condition that puts them at greater risk of a COVID-19 complication, or simply wants to wear a mask, then they should. Public health decisions need to be flexible and consistent with the latest science.

584,"Anew, concerning COVID-19 variant, omicron, is beginning to spread just in time to disrupt holiday parties and family gatherings.
But in televised remarks Monday, President Joe Biden said the new variant is “a cause for concern, not a cause for panic.”
Susan Weiss, a microbiologist and codirector of the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine’s Center for Research on Coronaviruses and Other Emerging Pathogens, echoed the president’s remarks, encouraging people to get vaccinated and practice safety to protect themselves from getting sick.
“It’s not a monster, it’s just another variant,” said Weiss, who spoke with The Inquirer about what people should know about omicron.
What is the omicron variant?
Omicron is a COVID-19 variant that was first identified in South Africa late last week. It is considered a variant of concern by the World Health Organization because it has potential to be highly transmissible.
Is omicron more dangerous than the original strain of COVID-19?
Not necessarily. Scientists who have studied the mutations of omicron say it has potential to spread more quickly. There isn’t enough research yet to know if the omicron variant is more highly transmissible. It’s important to keep in mind that even if the variant is more contagious, that does not mean it will be more deadly. So far, there is no evidence to suggest that omicron causes more severe illness.
Do the vaccines protect against omicron?
Scientists and doctors emphasize that getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself against any strain of COVID-19 — including the omicron variant. We do not yet have enough research to know exactly how much protection the vaccines offer against omicron, but scientists expect the vaccines will be effective against the new variant because they have been effective against other variants of concern, including delta.
if I already had COVID-19?
Preliminary evidence suggests that people who already had COVID-19 (and have some level of natural immunity) could contract the omicron variant more easily than other variants, according to WHO.
What can I do to protect myself from the omicron variant?
Get vaccinated, get a booster shot if it’s been six months since you were fully vaccinated, wear a mask (especially in indoor public areas), and exercise caution in crowds.
What are the symptoms of omicron?
Scientists and doctors are still learning about this new variant, but WHO said Nov. 28 that early data suggest symptoms in those infected with the omicron variant are similar to those from infections with the original COVID-19 strain and delta variant. Most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, chills, shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, and loss of smell or taste.
Is the omicron variant in the U.S.?
As of Monday, there had not been any confirmed cases of the omicron variant in thius country, but it is only a matter of time. For example, the delta variant, which was first identified in India, is now the dominant strain in the United States. Omicron has been identified in Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia, and many other countries.
How did omicron get its name?
COVID-19 variants are given Greek alphabet letter names in the order in which they’re identified. Omicron is the 15th letter of the Greek alphabet. The delta variant is named for the Greek alphabet’s fourth letter. The variants in between those two have not attracted much attention because they haven’t spread as much. (In assigning names to variants, WHO skipped the two letters before omicron — nu, because it sounds like the word new, and xi, because it is a common last name.)
Can Istill have my family over for the holidays?
In remarks Monday, Biden said he did not expect to restore the interstate travel restrictions that were in place in 2020 and would not recommend that states reinstate other lockdown restrictions, such as capacity limits for indoor gatherings. Those types of restrictions were necessary to protect people last year because vaccines were not yet widely available, but are no longer necessary, so long as people get vaccinated, get a booster, and continue wearing masks.
Can Itravel internationally?
A travel restriction to the United States from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, or Zimbabwe took effect Monday. Biden said he does not expect to expand international air travel restrictions. For Americans traveling by air, the CDC recommends being fully vaccinated before flying, avoiding trips if you are sick, wearing a mask when indoors, and checking whether your airline requires proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 test.
Are variants of COVID-19 the new normal?
Not necessarily. Viruses constantly mutate in an effort to find a way to spread more efficiently. The more a virus replicates, the more variants it can create. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the virus from replicating. Not only does vaccination protect you from contracting the virus, it prevents the virus from spreading and evolving into new strains. sgantz@inquirer.com

President Biden visits a General Motors assembly plant in Detroit, Nov. 17, 2021. Rising prices for gas and a holiday meal could come back to bite Democrats, who fear that inflation may upend their electoral prospects in the 2022 midterms. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)


AUBURN HILLS, Mich. — Samantha Martin, a single mother shopping ahead of Thanksgiving, lamented how rising gas and grocery prices have eaten away at the raise she got this year as a manager at McDonald’s.
Gas “is crazy out of hand,” Martin said as she returned a shopping cart at an Aldi discount market in Auburn Hills, a Detroit suburb, to collect a 25-cent deposit.
Her most recent fill-up was $3.59 a gallon, about $1 more than the price in the spring. Her raise, to $16 an hour from $14, was “pretty good, but it’s still really hard to manage,” Martin said. “I got a raise just to have the gas go up, and that’s what my raise went to.”
Martin, 35, a political independent, doesn’t blame either party for inflation, but in a season of discontent, her disapproval fell more heavily on Democrats who run Washington. She voted for President Joe Biden but is disappointed with him and his party. “I think I would probably give somebody else a shot,” she said.
As Americans go on the road this week to travel for family gatherings, the higher costs of driving and one of the most expensive meals of the year have alarmed Democrats, who fear that inflation may upend their electoral prospects in the midterms. Republicans are increasingly confident that a rising cost of living — the ultimate kitchen-table issue — will be the most salient factor in delivering a red wave in 2022.
Democrats’ passage in quick succession of the $1 trillion infrastructure law and, in the House, of a $2.2 trillion social safety net and climate bill, promise once-in-a-generation investments that Democratic candidates plan to run on next year, with many of the policies in the bills broadly popular.
But, despite rising wages and falling unemployment, Democrats are also in danger of being swept aside in a hostile political environment shaped in large part by the highest inflation in 30 years, which has defied early predictions that it would be short-lived as the country pulled out of the pandemic.

With control of Congress and many key governor seats at stake, Republicans are pointing to public and private surveys that show inflation is linked to Americans’ falling approval of Biden. And, given the wholesale gerrymanders drawn, particularly by Republicans, in the current round of congressional redistricting, the Democrats would face a high bar in keeping their paper-thin majority in the House of Representatives, even in a favorable environment.
The president’s recent tour of ports, bridges and auto plants — which was meant to promote the infrastructure legislation — was overshadowed in part by inflation anxieties. As he test-drove an electric Hummer at a General Motors plant in Detroit this past week, his message of a future of zero-emission vehicles was eclipsed by a present in which Americans are driving more miles in conventional vehicles, contributing to soaring gas prices.

Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., in a vulnerable House district, wrote to Biden this past week that inflation was the most pressing concern of her constituents. A former CIA analyst in Iraq, she urged the president to pressure Saudi Arabia to increase oil output.
Slotkin, who won her seat in the midterm wave of 2018, is one of two Michigan Democrats in highly competitive districts that include the Detroit suburbs. In the Donald Trump years, Democrats had mixed results in the populous region, advancing in white-collar communities but losing ground with their traditional union supporters.
In an interview, Slotkin said that during a recent visit home, she heard constantly about the high costs of gas and groceries, and experienced them herself. “I buy groceries; I drive a ton,” she said. “Thanksgiving week is going to be more expensive by a long shot than last Thanksgiving.”
She acknowledged the political peril that rising consumer prices could pose for her party if it continues next year. “Kitchen-table issues affect Michigan and the Midwest more than any other national issue going on in Washington,” she said.
In interviews with voters in suburban Detroit, including from Slotkin’s district and that of the second vulnerable Democrat, Rep. Haley Stevens, residents almost universally acknowledged the pain of rising prices on their budgets. But it was unclear, from their accounts, that Democrats would suffer politically. Most voters ascribed blame according to their party leanings — as they do on almost all issues in an era of hyperpolarization.
Margie Kulaga of Hazel Park, a Trump voter in 2020, said she paid 49 cents a pound, up from 33 cents a pound last year, for a 23-pound turkey that she had just bought from a Kroger market. Prices for meat and eggs have risen by 11.9% in the Midwest from a year ago, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
“I blame Biden, his whole administration,’’ Kulaga, 55, said. “I never used to cut coupons, but now I do.”
On the other hand, Gloria Bailey, 63, a special-education teacher who lives in the suburb of Redford, is a Biden supporter who said rising costs should not be laid at his doorstep.
“The coronavirus has affected a lot of shipments and deliveries and crops and drivers who bring the food to market,” she said.

This month, Republicans broadly advanced in elections across the country, especially in Virginia, prompting forecasts of a similar tide in 2022. Glenn Youngkin won the Virginia governorship after emphasizing the rights of parents to control how schools operate and what they teach.
But Youngkin’s chief strategist, Jeff Roe, said the “big takeaway” of the election was how the rising cost of living had significantly motivated voters, an issue that was little covered by the news media. He predicted it would drive Senate and House races around the country next year (many of which he and his firm have a hand in).
“The cost of living is too high, and they ascribe that pain to Democrats,” he said. “It just wasn’t this expensive when Trump was there — that’s what the voters think.”

Consumer prices in Michigan and the Midwest rose by 6.6% in October, more than the national average, compared with a year ago.
The causes are the same as what drives the national spike, the steepest in 31 years, economists say — high demand for goods by consumers spending again after the pandemic lockdown and a global supply chain with lots of kinks still to be worked out. Gas prices are high partly because of a choke on production by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Some economists — and many Republicans — blame Democrats’ $1.9 trillion COVID relief aid in the spring for overstimulating demand. They warn that Democrats’ new big spending measure, the Build Back Better plan, which targets struggling families and workers with the most substantive programs since the Great Society in the 1960s, will further push up prices.
The White House counters that inflation is tied to short-term bottlenecks in the supply chain; its major domestic spending, the administration said, will eventually tame inflation by making businesses and workers more productive.
Moody’s Analytics, an economic forecaster favored by the White House, predicted that if the Build Back Better plan passes (it is now in the Senate), it will slightly raise inflation in 2022, to 2.5% in the final quarter. That is close to the Federal Reserve’s target rate.
Still, predictions early this year by the Fed that inflation was “transitory” have not borne out.
In the meantime, Americans’ approval of Biden’s handling of the economy is falling. In a Quinnipiac University national poll released this past week, only 34% of Americans approved of the president’s handling of the economy.

The poll illustrated the dilemma for Democrats: Strong majorities supported both the infrastructure law and the Build Back Better plan. But pluralities said they wanted to see Republicans gain control next year of the Senate and the House.
Although much could change in the economy and the political climate in a year, Republican strategists are urging their candidates to run hard against Democrats as the party of inflation.

“I believe it is the single biggest issue that affects the electorate,"" said Dan Conston, president of the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC that focuses on House races. “For a voter, it does not require them knowing every nuance of fiscal policy and how that relates to inflation. They are fundamentally feeling the pain already, and they have one group of people to blame for it: Democrats, who control all of Washington.”
One such potential voter is Jessica Bryen, a stay-at-home mother of two. “I consider myself a regular middle-of-the-road person, but I don’t like what’s going on right now,” she said. “Since Biden took office, things went up.”

Recently, Bryen and her husband, a government employee, moved from a townhouse and into a home they bought, straining their budget. Though she said she regularly voted in presidential elections, she sat out in 2020 because she didn’t like either candidate. She is undecided about which party should control Congress.
“Regular Middle America needs more care and concern,” she said. “Obviously, infrastructure’s important, and climate’s important, but so are gas and homes and groceries.”

","Thanksgiving Will Cost More This Year. That Could Cost Democrats, Too."
586,"Aug. 2 - Finding scorekeepers is the toughest part of organizing the Kiwanis Robbie McEvers Golf Tournament.
Keeping score is not a hard job; you walk or ride around with the young golfers, help guide them through the course, and keep track of their scores so they don't have to. But it can take a few hours, and being out on a golf course on a humid 90-degree day isn't everybody's idea of fun.
But it was exactly where Jacksonville Middle School teachers Lauren Range and Cathy Gibson wanted to be.
""It's so fun. This is great,"" Range said. ""One of my kids did the Robbie McEvers several years back. We're not a golf family by any means, but I love that this is a tradition in Jacksonville. I think it's wonderful.""
Range and Gibson are new members of the club; they won't officially become Kiwanians until next week, but they couldn't wait for their first volunteer assignment. Service organizations everywhere are having a hard time finding new members. Range and Gibson wanted to join.
""I'm a teacher, and I really believe in giving back to your community,"" Gibson said. ""And so I thought this would be a perfect organization to join to be able to give back even more to the community, in a different way.""
""Well, you know, my kids are getting to the age that they're a little bit older,"" Range said. ""I have two high school kids and a junior high kid, and they don't need me every day for everything, like they used to. And I just wanted to give back to the community. I grew up in Jacksonville, born and raised, and I teach at Jacksonville Middle School, and it's just my way of giving back. So I'm excited about it.""
It took around 50 volunteers to help run the tournament on Thursday, registering golfers, working concessions and keeping score. A total of 28 people worked as scorekeepers.
On Thursday organizers cut the tournament in half for the older golfers, reducing the number of holes from 18 to nine. It was that hot.
""It really wasn't too bad,"" Gibson said. ""We have a nice breeze right now, and it's kind of overcast. There were only one or two holes that got hot. They had water out there and cold towels, and the girls had things to drink, too.""
Some scorekeepers took carts onto the course. Range and Gibson both walked. ""I didn't get my run in this morning,"" Range said, ""so this is my exercise.""
Gibson said the hardest part about Thursday was making sure she knew where the next hole was. Range had to make a couple of rulings on shots that found the water, but she double-checked the rule book, and the round went off without a hitch. ""Other than that, it was a clean game,"" she said. ""They did a really nice job.""
Bob Large, a past president of Kiwanis, also volunteered as a scorekeeper on Thursday. He's been volunteering at the tournament for more than a decade.
""It's a great cause, and the kids are wonderful,"" he said. ""I enjoy it.""
A total of 140 golfers signed up for the tournament this year, with 80 golfers on the Links Golf Course, and 60 on the Nichols Park course. Organizers were a little worried that golfers might not come back after last year's tournament was cancelled due to COVID-19, but Paul Reither, co-chair of the Kiwanis golf committee, was pleased with the turnout.
Because of the lingering COVID threat, participants have been asked to limit contact on the course, and not gather in large groups in the concession area. To keep people from crowding together, the tournament will not be handing out awards Friday.
Range and Gibson both golf, occasionally. They were surprised how well the young golfers played.
""They are so good,"" Gibson said. ""I was like, wow, you guys hit it a lot better than I do. I'm a good putt-putt person. So yeah, they had a really good time, and one of the girls was golfing for JMS, so it was kind of fun to meet her.""
""Lots of pretty drives that I myself would not have been able to do even if I had practiced for 10 years,"" Range said. ""They are wonderful golfers. I love it. So it's been fun today.""

587,"Publication: The Carroll News, , John Carroll University , Cleveland, OHOn April 17, Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India held a rally attended by thousands. That same day, India recorded 261,000 new cases of COVID-19. India’s second wave of the virus has continued to worsen, recording 300,000 new cases daily since April 22.
According to CNN, India accounted for half of the new COVID-19 cases globally in 2021. India wasn’t prepared for this second wave; hospitals are overflowing and running out of oxygen. Crematoriums have run out of wood as bodies pile up. Only 2% of India’s entire population has been vaccinated, even though the country is the world’s biggest producer of COVID-19 vaccines, according to Reuters.
On May 1, India reported 401,993 new cases of the virus and the deaths jumped to 3,523, taking the country’s total to 211,853. With cases so high and with no signs of slowing down, the citizens of India have become enraged at the government according to CNN.
“The number of COVID deaths is staggering,” said Cliff Anthony, an Indian native and Cleveland-based journalist. “Among them was one of my cousins.”
Many believe that the recent surge was the fault of Modi and his Hindu nationalist government. Julia Hollingsworth reported that Modi didn’t prepare for a second wave of COVID-19 and also encouraged large gatherings at Hindu festivals and political rallies.
“The second deadly COVID-19 surge in India could have been prevented if Prime Minister Narendra Modi put people’s safety first instead of focusing on his political career,” Anthony added.
Anthony said that Modi didn’t urge his supporters to wear masks or to follow the six-foot distance and other restrictions during his recent crowded election rallies.
Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, the general secretary of the opposition Indian National Congress, tweeted, “The government has failed us all. Even those of us who oppose and fight them could not have foreseen a complete abdication of leadership and governance at a time as devastating as this.”
With many in India feeling the pandemic was over, there was a slower uptake of vaccines than expected in early 2021. However, cases started to spike again in February. Modi and his government still claimed that India, “defeated COVID under the able, sensitive, committed and visionary leadership.”
As India’s cases began to rise even more, Modi stayed silent and didn’t call for a national lockdown, which angered many people. The hashtags #ModiMustResign and #ModiMadeDisaster quickly went viral on Twitter, according to Hollingsworth. Seeing as the country viewed Modi as a saintly figure who always acted in the nation’s best interest, this uproar of anger and resentment was a surprise.
Modi has enacted “micro containment zones” but has left the implementation and locations up to the individual states. CNN reported that eight of India’s states have some form of lockdown, including the capital of New Delhi, which is in a complete lockdown.
“The health system in India is arcane, and it is not prepared to handle such major outbreaks, let alone a minor one,” said Anthony. “The Modi government should mobilize all its resources to combat the pandemic and let the health professionals do their job without political interference.”

588,"With COVID-19 cases surging in the region, Northampton County will reinstate its mask mandate for anyone entering one of its buildings. The mandate begins Friday.
In an announcement Thursday afternoon, county Executive Lamont McClure said anyone entering one of its buildings will be required to wear a mask and undergo a temperature check. He urged residents to get vaccinated to help stop the spread of the virus.
It is unfortunate that the county must re-impose its facemask policy, but with the number of cases rising and the increase in hospitalizations, it is necessary to protect public health, he said.
The mask mandate will return to the Northampton County Courthouse in Easton, the Human Services Building in Bethlehem Township, and the 911 Center and Forensics Center in Upper Nazareth Township.
Gracedale in Upper Nazareth Township, and the Northampton County Jail in Easton never ended their mask requirement. The jail has been closed to visitors. Family and loved ones are allowed to schedule visits to Gracedale.
The number of cases in Northampton County has more than doubled in the past week, going from 55 diagnoses per 100,000 residents to 120.2 cases. The jump means Northampton County now has a high level of community transmissions by federal Centers for Disease Control and Protection guidelines. The CDC recommends people wear masks indoors at this level, even for people who have been vaccinated.
Through a partnership with Coordinated Health, the county is still offering residents vaccines at a drive-thru operation at 3100 Emrick Blvd. in Bethlehem Township. The center is open 10 a.m.-2 p.m. Monday, Wednesdays and Fridays, and 2-6 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays. Residents ages 12 and over must make an appointment, but may select from among the Johnson & Johnson, Moderna or Pfizer vaccines.
Appointments can be made at the website LVHN.org/appointments, through the MyLVHN patient portal or by calling 833-584-6283 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Monday through Friday or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends.
Residents may also receive a COVID-19 test at the same site. Appointments are not necessary for a test. Residents should bring a photo ID or an insurance card.

594,"The agency will wait for data on whether three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's Covid vaccine are effective in young children after new, disappointing data.WASHINGTON -- In a striking reversal, federal regulators said on Friday that they would wait for data on how well three doses of Pfizer-BioNTech's coronavirus vaccine work in children younger than 5 before deciding whether to authorize the vaccine for that age group.The decision by the Food and Drug Administration most likely rules out shots for roughly 18 million of the nation's youngest children until at least April. The Biden administration had been hoping to expand vaccination to those 6 months through 4 years of age as early as next week. They are the only Americans not yet eligible for shots.Pfizer-BioNTech asked for the delay after the companies discovered that the Omicron wave had led to a far higher rate of infection than they had previously recorded among young volunteers in their clinical trial. The new data underscored that the Omicron variant was better than the earlier Delta variant at evading the vaccine's protection, and it showed that two doses, which had already fallen short by another measure, were not effective enough.As a result, the companies and the F.D.A. agreed to wait for the results from a third dose, which are expected in early April.The turnabout came as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released data on Friday showing that booster shots of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines lose some of their effectiveness against emergency room visits and hospitalizations by the four-month point. The agency said the data was some of earliest evidence on the durability of boosters. While it showed three doses offered better protection than two, it raised sobering questions about how long that protection lasts against severe disease.Together, the two developments dampened some earlier optimism about vaccines. They also presented at least a temporary setback for the Biden administration's vaccination campaign.Researchers hope that by April, Pfizer and BioNTech will be able to demonstrate that three doses protect children, with data showing both stronger immune responses and more success in warding off symptomatic infections.The companies said in a news release that they would wait for the data on a three-dose vaccine given the study's rapid pace and because they ""continue to believe it may provide a higher level of protection in this age group.""The F.D.A. began pressing Pfizer-BioNTech to seek authorization for a two-shot regimen weeks ago, despite disappointing results from the trial that were announced in December. Children ages 2 through 4 produced only 60 percent of the antibody levels that older teens and young adults did. The older age group was used as a benchmark because the vaccine had proven effective for them.Children 6 months to 2 years did produce the sought-after level of antibodies. The dosage was one-tenth of that given to those 12 and older, and there were no serious safety concerns, officials have said.This month, Pfizer-BioNTech submitted a request for emergency authorization, and the F.D.A. scheduled a meeting of its outside advisory committee for next Tuesday, saying it hoped to get a head start on vaccinating young children with two shots, likely adding a third later.Then, late on Thursday, Pfizer alerted the F.D.A. that it had more recent data, from mid-January on, showing a more discouraging picture as the Omicron variant bore down. The new data revealed that two doses were not sufficiently effective in preventing symptomatic infection. The illness was generally mild and no children were hospitalized, according to people familiar with the study.In a call with reporters on Friday, Dr. Peter Marks, the F.D.A.'s top vaccine regulator and an advocate of the two-dose strategy, said the latest data had forced a new reckoning. ""Yes, some of this was late breaking,"" he said, ""but that's what our job is -- to adjust to it.""While many pediatric experts had been sympathetic to the F.D.A.'s initial push to consider two doses, some said on Friday that the regulators were right to hold off.""I honestly let out a woo-hoo of elation that reason and science had prevailed, and that they actually really did do the right thing,"" said Dr. James Conway, a pediatric infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics.Dr. Conway said he had been concerned that prematurely authorizing a partial vaccine regimen for young children without compelling data would have intensified suspicion among some Americans that the federal government had cut corners.Norman W. Baylor, a former director of the F.D.A.'s vaccines office, said the agency had been ""reactionary"" on a highly delicate issue, perhaps because of public pressure. A lot of parents, he noted, had been saying, ""I don't care, just give my kid the two doses and even if it's a little bit and they're not protected fully, that'll do the trick.""""But we don't know that until the data are reviewed,"" he said.Dr. Baylor and some other experts questioned whether any coronavirus vaccine developer had yet figured out an effective dose for the youngest children, or how durable protection would be for them. Moderna, the other major vaccine manufacturer, is currently testing a stronger dose than Pfizer's for children under 5. But so far, Moderna's vaccine has only been authorized for adults.Some parents on Friday expressed anguish over the news.""I'm feeling despair, despondent, frustrated, confused,"" said Rachel Perera, a graduate student in Los Angeles and mother of an 8-month-old son. ""I feel like the goal posts have been moving.""Ms. Perera said that she had been hoping to make a long-awaited trip to the East Coast this spring to see friends and introduce them to her son. She and her husband have been avoiding most contact with others during the Omicron wave in order to protect him.""I was hoping that we would have some hope, that it would help us get some semblance of normalcy,"" she said of the vaccine for children under 5. ""I feel like the world is moving on without us, the parents of little kids.""The F.D.A.'s most recent vaccine decisions have been highly fraught. Top Biden administration health officials pushed hard for authorization of booster shots in the fall, only to be forced to scale back their plans. But they were vindicated, some experts say, when the Omicron variant showed that it could more easily evade two-dose protection than its predecessor, the Delta variant.At least several members of the F.D.A.'s outside advisory panel were skeptical of the two-dose plan for children under 5, and it was not clear that the panel would have recommended it. The panel's advice is not binding, but the F.D.A. usually follows it.The meeting scheduled for Tuesday had been expected to focus on just how urgent a priority the F.D.A. and its outside advisers consider vaccination to be for the youngest age group. Dr. Ofer Levy, a pediatrician at Harvard Medical School and member of the F.D.A. advisory committee, said on Friday that the agency would have been criticized no matter how it ruled.""They're under intense pressure,"" he said. ""I don't envy them.""Some infectious disease experts have argued there was not enough of an emergency to justify the F.D.A.'s push to authorize two doses, given the combination of the trial results, the decline in Omicron cases in many parts of the country and the fact that young children are unlikely to become severely ill from the virus.Others argued that the toll of the virus on children required the F.D.A. to jump-start its review process. Nearly 400 children under 5 have died of Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic. Even if Omicron is fading, those experts argued, another variant could emerge as a new threat just as unexpectedly as Omicron did in November.Children have been more at risk during the Omicron wave, pediatricians have said.Dr. Kristin Moffitt, a physician at Boston Children's Hospital, said that as more young children showed up in hospitals this winter, many of those she saw in her hospital were more prone to severe illness because they had underlying conditions, including congenital heart disease or immune deficiencies.""Those with underlying conditions tended to be more severe and require I.C.U. care,"" she said. ""The majority needed a couple of days of oxygen supplementation, as well as help staying hydrated.""Dr. Jessica Snowden, the chief of the pediatric infectious disease division at Arkansas Children's Hospital, said Covid cases at her hospital had fallen from a daily peak of 46 in mid-January to 19.Still, she said, ""I hear from lots of parents every day asking, 'Do you know, do you know? When's it going to be approved?""' She added, ""Think about how fast a new variant can spread.""Still, the uptake of the vaccine in children -- including in those 5 to 11, who began receiving Pfizer-BioNTech shots in early November -- has been strikingly low. Only about a third of the 28 million children in that age group have received at least one dose so far, according to C.D.C. data. Three in 10 parents of children younger than age 5 now say that they intend to get them vaccinated as soon as shots become available, according to a recent survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation.Malia Jones, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies vaccine hesitancy in children, predicted that parents would be even less likely to get shots for the youngest children. Parents of children in this age group, she said, have long been prone to believe misinformation about childhood vaccines, including theories that they are filled with toxins or cause autism.""My expectation is that uptake is going to be really, really poor,"" she said of the coronavirus shot for children younger than 5. ""We're already facing a very steep uphill battle for this age group, whether or not the efficacy data are there.""Fiona Backes, 5, with her mother, Megan Backes, after she received a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.

595,"Three goals used to be a boon for the Wild.
Not by today's standards.
The trim total wasn't as splashy as recent tallies, but the 3-1 triumph over the Kings on Friday at Xcel Energy Center was just as effective -- extending the team's winning streak to a season-long five games while handing Los Angeles its first loss in seven games.
""It was a great game more towards our identity,"" goalie Cam Talbot said. ""We know we're not going to score six goals every night, but we're comfortable in these 3-1 games as well.""
Talbot was almost unbeatable in his first start since Feb. 2 following an absence caused by the NHL's COVID protocols, picking up 27 saves. In front of him, the Wild offense used a three-goal surge on three straight shots in 3 minutes, 3 seconds to put the game out of reach.
First up was -- who else? -- rookie Kirill Kaprizov with one of the most impressive goals of his young NHL career at 12:33 of the first period.
After his initial shot hit the side of the net, Kaprizov scooped up the rebound, veered around the goal and then wrapped the puck behind Kings goalie Jonathan Quick from his knees, after falling as he was being chased by defender Drew Doughty.
""His separation from people is clearly special,"" coach Dean Evason said. ""Combine that with his attitude, his team-first mentality, it's exciting for us as an organization.""
The finish moved Kaprizov's career-high point streak to four games, during which he has two goals and five assists. Overall, his 16 points pace the Wild and all NHL rookies.
With an assist on the goal, Kaprizov's linemate Mats Zuccarello has 10 points during a five-game point streak, which is the longest by a Wild player this season. And their line with center Victor Rask is up to 21 points in the past four games.
""It seems like Zuccarello came into the lineup, he brought his swagger in with it and we all kind of followed,"" Nick Bjugstad said.
Only 58 seconds after Kaprizov's goal, Bjugstad buried the puck after it bounced out into the slot off the end boards for the 100th goal of his career.
And at 15:36, center Joel Eriksson Ek capped off the barrage with his team-leading seventh goal, a shot he fired past Quick after previously hitting the post. Eriksson Ek is already one goal shy of matching his career high of eight from last season.
Quick finished with 27 saves.
Ultimately, nine different Wild players registered a point, and the team has scored 23 times during its winning streak -- which Talbot preserved late in the third period when the Kings applied their best pressure. Not until 2:50 remained did Los Angeles wreck his shutout bid, on a redirect by Jeff Carter.
""No one wants to come in and kill a streak like that, especially when you haven't played in a while,"" Talbot said.
The Wild's run started after the team stumbled 4-0 at Los Angeles on Feb. 16, the Wild's first game back from a COVID-19 shutdown. The lineup was much different back then than it is now, with taxi-squad players and call-ups filling in the holes caused by the players sidelined on the COVID list.
But as the Wild's health improved, so did its results.
The team swept the Ducks before overwhelming the Sharks and Avalanche by 6-2 scores to go 4-1 on a five-game road trip.
Evason said he was cautious of a letdown in the team's first game back in St. Paul, challenging his players to show up ready to play rather than feeling their way into the game.
And that's exactly what happened.
""We were talking before the game started about coming out with good energy, having a good focus,"" defenseman Ryan Suter said, ""and the first period was the result of that good energy and focus.""

596,"Publication: Idaho Argonaut, , University of Idaho , Moscow, IDLast year’s de-stress week, all events were held online due to COVID-19 concerns. They couldn’t cancel since de-stress week is an essential time for students to relax before finals week rolls along. Now at a time where stress is still high, Vandal Health is making sure that they can accommodate them to help ease their stress.
This year, de-stress week will feature a mixture of some online, but also some in-person events as well. Some traditional relaxing events, like yoga, are still being done. However, for this year there are a few new items.
For one, they are offering grocery store tours where students can sign up with a small group and go to Safeway. They will learn about pricing and tricks on how to spot healthy food by looking at the nutritional facts.
There are also therapy dogs for students to pet to relieve stress. Events will be featuring plants, workshops and a mindfulness drop-in. On Thursday there’s even a mountain bike ride being held by the Outdoor Program; participants have to bring their own bike.
From May 2 to May 8, the I Am Resilient virtual 5K will be occurring. People can sign up at any time on the University of Idaho website. Participants can walk, bike outside or at the gym at any pace they want. If they submit a photo of them doing their route, they can be entered to win a Hydro Flask.
“Every year we do a 5K called Dash after dark that’s held at about 9 p.m. or so with glow sticks and it’s a chance for folks to kind of get out and move around campus at a time when maybe most folks typically aren’t out and about on campus,” Amanda Ferstead, the mental health coordinator said. “But this year with COVID restrictions we decided that it was probably the best and safest option for our participants to go virtual and give folks time to complete it.”
Being outside and running is a great way to relieve stress, and this event seeks to get people out and about in nice weather.
Wellbeing ambassadors is a program that features UI students who are passionate about the health and wellbeing of the people on campus. The program seeks to help people spiritually, mentally and physically. This is through the use of volunteers, mentors and activities that seek to help people with their mental health and deal with stress.

597,"The Allegheny County Health Department has resumed sending second dose invitations for its new registration system, following the system's bumpy unveiling on Thursday.
The county officially launched a new online registration system for individuals to sign up for the covid-19 vaccine. The system was meant to make signing up easier -- allowing users to register for first doses, second doses and a waiting list that would alert them of their eligibility.
The health department, according to its original announcement, said people who already received their first dose through the health department but had not yet scheduled their second dose would receive an email containing an ""appointment number"" for doing so with the new system. But within hours, individuals trying to sign up for their second doses were reporting issues with the site.
By Thursday around 7 p.m., the health department tweeted there were at least two issues with the site affecting users trying to sign up for a second dose (those signing up for a first shot were not affected). A few hours later, the department said it would not send any more second dose appointment emails for the rest of the night, ""due to several issues that need resolved.""
""We expect to begin issuing 2nd dose emails again tomorrow following overnight testing & resolution of remaining issues,"" the department tweeted.
Allegheny County Health Department
The county on Friday afternoon said the health department has once again begun sending out corrected second dose appointment emails, which contain the code necessary for scheduling.
In a news release, the health department highlighted a few caveats, as follows:As some individuals using smart phones are unable to confirm their registration, when possible, individuals should schedule their second appointment on other devices.The system automatically searches for available appointments for the next five days from the start date; if a ""no appointments are available"" message is received, research using the next week's day as the start date.Original emails indicated that the code would expire in 24 hours. That has been reset to 72 hours and the corrected emails will state the same.

599,"(TNSJou) -- The University of Wisconsin Madison campus issued the following news on Jan. 21, 2022:By Kelly April TyrrellA new study confirms that, compared to earlier versions of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the omicron variant causes less severe disease in mice and hamsters, which are reliable models for understanding COVID-19.The findings, previously available as a preprint and published following peer review today (Jan. 21) in the journal Nature, align with preliminary data from studies of people infected with the variant and offer insight into the nature of the disease with omicron. The variant emerged in late November 2021 and was first identified by scientists in Botswana and South Africa.Led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, along with Michael Diamond and Adrianus (Jacco) Boon at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, the collaborative effort was the work of the SARS-CoV-2 Assessment of Viral Evolution (SAVE) program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.""SAVE meets four times per week,"" Kawaoka explains, and includes teams analyzing sequences from viruses isolated across the world and screening for new variants; teams studying the biology of new variants in animal models; and teams working to isolate viruses for study, examining viral replication and testing how well previous infection or vaccination provides protection against emerging variants. Researchers who typically compete for publications and funding have come together in light of the COVID-19 crisis.Peter Halfmann, a research associate professor at UW-Madison, was among the first in the world to isolate the omicron variant from human samples for study. The samples came from infected patients in Wisconsin, New York, Georgia and Tokyo, and each contained slight sequence differences.Once the viruses were isolated from the samples, scientists throughout the SAVE network began to test them in mice and hamsters. Animal studies are an important step in understanding new variants and how well they respond to existing countermeasures, such as vaccines and therapies.The spike protein of omicron contains more than 30 mutations -- a striking number relative to earlier variants. Because current vaccines and antibody treatments are based on these earlier versions, researchers were concerned that vaccines and therapies would be rendered less effective.Computer models and studies that looked at the binding capacity of the virus to ACE2 receptors, which grant the virus entry into cells, also suggested that omicron would better attach to cells.Despite this, the researchers were surprised to find that four different strains of mice and two strains of hamsters that were exposed to the omicron variant experienced less severe disease than when they were exposed to earlier versions of the virus, including the beta and delta variants. (All of the variants they tested were capable of infecting rodents.)The animals lost less weight and experienced milder illness, experiencing no significant changes in their lung function and fewer signs of disease in their lungs.Animals genetically modified to possess human ACE2 receptors saw slightly more disease when exposed to omicron, but still did not become as ill as those infected with earlier versions of the virus.This single study alone can't fully explain why omicron behaves differently. But the scientists cite another pre-print study that shows omicron makes copies of itself more quickly in areas of the upper respiratory tract relative to deeper regions of the lungs, which could limit its severity while also making the variant more readily transmissible.There is also much the study does not address, such as the effect of omicron on other organs, or how well the variant responds to vaccine-induced immunity or to treatments. However, efforts are underway to answer these questions, both in animal models and in people.In fact, a study published Jan. 19 in Nature, co-authored by Kawaoka and led by Diamond, shows that existing therapeutic monoclonal antibodies used to treat infections with earlier variants are less effective against omicron.The study demonstrates that looking at each mutation in isolation or trying to make predictions based solely on the number of mutations can't reliably tell us about the behavior of the virus. That's especially true, says Kawaoka, a professor of pathobiological sciences at the UW-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, given that most people in the U.S. by now -- two years into the pandemic -- are either vaccinated or have been exposed to the virus, or both.""The sequence information and modeling may not predict what happens in humans,"" he explains.The research collaboration was made possible because of efforts between researchers across the globe who pooled data, shared materials and expertise, and were able to tell a more complete story than any individual effort alone. It was also made possible by the contributions of others at UW-Madison and at the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene, including Allen Bateman, Samantha Loeber, Jorge Osorio and Kelsey Florek.The study was supported by a number of grants and contracts from the National Institutes of Health. These include: R01 AI157155, 327 U01 AI151810, 75N93021C00014, HHSN272201400008C, 329 HHSN272201700041I, 75N93020F00001/A38, P51OD011132, 330 R56AI147623, HHSN272201400004C, 75N93021C00017, P01 331 AI060699, RO1 AI129269, 75N93019C00051 and 75N93021C00016.It was also supported by grants from the Japan Research Program on Emerging and Re-emerging Infectious Diseases (JP20fk0108412, JP21fk0108615, JP20fk0108472, and JP21fk0108104), a Project Promoting Support for Drug Discovery (JP20nk0101632), and the Japan Program for Infectious Diseases Research and Infrastructure (JP21wm0125002) from the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.The Woodruff Health Sciences Center and Emory School of Medicine, Woodruff Health Sciences Center 2020 COVID-19 CURE Award also supported the study.

OMAHA, Neb. - More than a year after U.S. health care workers on the front lines against COVID-19 were saluted as heroes with nightly clapping from windows and balconies, some are being issued panic buttons in case of assault and ditching their scrubs before going out in public for fear of harassment.
Across the country, doctors and nurses are dealing with hostility, threats and violence from patients angry over safety rules designed to keep the scourge from spreading.
""A year ago, we're health care heroes and everybody's clapping for us,"" said Dr. Stu Coffman, a Dallas-based emergency room physician. ""And now we're being in some areas harassed and disbelieved and ridiculed for what we're trying to do, which is just depressing and frustrating.""
Cox Medical Center Branson in Missouri started giving panic buttons to up to 400 nurses and other employees after assaults per year tripled between 2019 and 2020 to 123, a spokeswoman said. One nurse had to get her shoulder X-rayed after an attack.
Hospital spokeswoman Brandei Clifton said the pandemic has driven at least some of the increase.
""So many nurses say, 'It's just part of the job,'"" Clifton said. ""It's not part of the job.""
Some hospitals have limited the number of public entrances. In Idaho, nurses said they are scared to go to the grocery store unless they have changed out of their scrubs so they aren't accosted by angry residents.
Doctors and nurses at a Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, hospital have been accused of killing patients by grieving family members who don't believe COVID-19 is real, said hospital spokeswoman Caiti Bobbitt. Others have been the subject of hurtful rumors spread by people angry about the pandemic.
""Our health care workers are almost feeling like Vietnam veterans, scared to go into the community after a shift,"" Bobbitt said.
Over Labor Day weekend in Colorado, a passerby threw an unidentified liquid at a nurse working at a mobile vaccine clinic in suburban Denver. Another person in a pickup truck ran over and destroyed signs put up around the clinic's tent.
About 3 in 10 nurses who took part in a survey this month by an umbrella organization of nurses unions across the U.S. reported an increase in violence where they work stemming from factors including staff shortages and more visitor restrictions. That was up from 2 in 10 in March, according to the National Nurses United survey of 5,000 nurses.
Michelle Jones, a nurse at a COVID-19 ICU unit in Wichita, Kan., said patients are coming in scared, sometimes several from the same family, and often near death. Their relatives are angry, thinking the nurses and doctors are letting them die.
""They cry, they yell, they sit outside our ICU in little groups and pray,"" Jones said. ""Lots of people think they are going to get miracles and God is not passing those out this year. If you come into my ICU, there is a good chance you are going to die.""
She said the powerful steroids that have shown promise often make patients angrier.
""It is like 'roid rage on people,"" she said. ""I've worked in health care for 26 years. and I've never seen anything like this. I've never seen the public act like this.""
Across the U.S., the COVID-19 crisis has caused people to behave badly toward one another in a multitude of ways.
Several people have been shot to death in disputes over masks in stores and other public places. Shouting matches and scuffles have broken out at school board meetings. A brawl erupted earlier this month at a New York City restaurant over its requirement that customers show proof of vaccination.
Dr. Chris Sampson, an emergency room physician in Columbia, Mo., said violence has always been a problem in the emergency department, but the situation has gotten worse in recent months. Sampson said he has been pushed up against a wall and seen nurses kicked.
Dr. Ashley Coggins, of St. Peter's Health Regional Medical Center in Helena, Mont., said she recently asked a patient whether he wanted to be vaccinated.
""He said, 'F, no,' and I didn't ask further because I personally don't want to get yelled at,"" Coggins said. ""You know, this is a weird time in our world, and the respect that we used to have for each other, the respect that people used to have for caregivers and physicians and nurses - it's not always there, and it makes this job way harder.""
Coggins said the patient told her that he ""wanted to strangle President Biden"" for pushing for vaccinations, prompting her to change the subject. She said security guards are now in charge of enforcing mask rules for hospital visitors so that nurses no longer have to be the ones to tell people to leave.
The hostility is making an already stressful job harder. Many places are suffering severe staffing shortages, in part because nurses have become burned out and quit.
""I think one thing that we have seen and heard from many of our people is that it is just really hard to come to work every day when people treat each other poorly,"" said Dr. Kencee Graves, a physician at the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City.
""If you have to fight with somebody about wearing a mask, or if you aren't allowed to visit and we have to argue about that, that is stressful.""",Health workers once saluted as heroes now get threats
603,"HOUSTON, April 23, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- The Jack Brooks Foundation is hosting an inaugural award ceremony featuring a frank discussion about voting and elections with award recipients Lina Hidalgo and Arnold Schwarzenegger, online and open to the public free of charge on Tuesday, April 27, at 12 noon CDT.   The host of the panel discussion, ""Elections and the Future of Voting,"" will be CBS News Correspondent Omar Villafranca.  The panel discussion promises to be a lively encounter between two very determined leaders who found creative ways to help Americans vote.  Interested viewers can register and access a link to view the event at https://link.jackbrooksfoundation.org/events.Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo and Arnold Schwarzenegger talk elections and the future of voting April 27 noon CDT.Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, executive of the county that includes most of Houston, and former California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger have been chosen to receive the first annual Jack Brooks Award, honoring leaders who elevated the needs of voters ahead of partisan politics to make it easier for citizens to cast ballots in 2020.  The mission of the Jack Brooks Foundation, in honor of the late Congressman Jack Brooks of Texas, is to develop independent, nonpartisan initiatives to empower, educate and motivate Americans to vote.
The discussion next Tuesday will focus on how both of the honorees eliminated barriers to voting in the 2020 election and their views on how to protect the rights of voters in every election.  In the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Hidalgo worked with other Harris County officials to find creative solutions for voters, including drive-through voting and early ballot drop-off, more in-person early voting locations and 24-hour voting at some locations.  The result was the highest turnout in the county since 1992 with 68% of registered voters voting, for a total of 1.6 million.
Through the Schwarzenegger Institute for State and Global Policy at the University of Southern California, Schwarzenegger offered $2.5 million in Democracy Grants to fund new polling places and increased voter access in eight states that had a history of voter suppression as identified in the Voting Rights Act.  The result was increased turnout in those areas that received the grants as compared to those that did not.

605,"Feb. 8While today  the age limit to get a COVID-19 vaccine lowered to 65, many people will have to wait because clinic appointments remain full with other older adults.
Public Health-Dayton & Montgomery County opened for vaccine appointments online at 8:30 a.m. Friday and by 8:45 a.m. those slots were listed as full. They also had some appointments reserved for people calling in by phone, which took ""about an hour to go through those,"" said Dan Suffoletto, spokesman the department. They had about 450 doses.
""Online ... we've got thousands of people trying to get the doses,"" Suffoletto said. ""The phone line takes a little bit longer because we've only got so many people answering the phone.""
Greene County Public Health's waitlist ballooned past 20,000 and Miami County Public Health didn't have any more availability it could open for this week.
It will be ""several weeks"" before the eligibility expands again to accommodate the larger 65 and older group, Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday. This will give clinics some time to start to catch up on those already eagerly seeking to be immunized.
On Friday, Feb. 12, Public Health-Dayton & Montgomery County will again open registration for more appointments.
""But we don't know how many doses we're going to get yet, so we don't how many there will be,"" Suffoletto said.
If you're eligible to get a vaccine, no central system exists at this point for registering at the different clinics, pharmacies and public health departments providing the shots. However, the state has a map where you can search to find which of the more than 700 vaccine providers in Ohio are located near you: vaccine.coronavirus.ohio.gov.
In Greene County, with more than 26,000 older adults not in a nursing home or congregate setting, the health department urged patience and said it could take several weeks or even longer, pending vaccine availability, before people on the waitlist receive a call. The department also encouraged people to check with other Greene County vaccine providers like Kroger.
""We are focusing on getting our most vulnerable population vaccinated who are most at risk of severe illness should they get COVID-19. We want to remind everyone that vaccine is in very short supply at this time and vaccinating everyone in Phase 1B is going to take a lot of time. Patience is key,"" Melissa Howell, health commissioner for Greene County Public Health said when the department shared the vaccine wait update.
As of Friday, about 8.3% of Ohioans had received at least one dose of a vaccine, including 39,481 vaccines started within the past 24 hours. A least 53% of those 80 and older have received at least one dose, which is the age group most at risk for severe disease or death from the respiratory virus.
More than 131,300 people in the nine-county region surrounding Dayton have received at least one dose.
While awaiting a turn for a vaccine, health officials have urged that people continue to take precautions such as wearing masks, keeping distance, ventilating spaces, staying home if sick and practicing good hand hygiene.
Miami County Public Health said Friday in a statement that new COVID-19 cases seem to be trending downward ""but this is not a time to stop safety precautions.""
""It will take some time to get enough people vaccinated before we can begin to ease any safety precautions,"" the department said.
Hospitalization numbers are steadily getting better but remain high. As of Friday, there were 178 inpatients at hospitals in the region with COVID-19, which is about 1 in 11 total inpatients. That's down 63% from 60 days ago when 1 in 4 inpatients were COVID-19 positive.
If Ohio continues to stay under 2,500 hospitalizations for seven consecutive days, the state's curfew could be lifted as early as next Thursday. Currently, the curfew is from 11 p.m. to 5 a.m.

607,"Gov. Ron DeSantis defended the Florida Board of Educations decision to penalize two local districts for having school mask mandates because of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying they were not defying me, thats defying the state of Floridas laws.
If you make it about me, you get on CNN, we know that, right? DeSantis said Wednesday.
DeSantis comments came hours before school boards in Miami-Dade and Hillsborough joined Alachua and Broward in imposing masks at schools.
The state board said Tuesday that the Alachua and Broward boards violated state rules by requiring masks for students. DeSantis has threatened withholding funding and officials salaries or jobs, but the board called for further investigation before any penalties would be imposed.
There will obviously be consequences, I think, in probably a number of different ways, he said without elaborating what those would be. At the end of the day, you have local officials who do not believe they need to follow the law. Thats what this is about.
The Orange County school district, the largest in the state, recorded 238 new student cases of COVID-19 on Monday alone, almost equaling the 259 cases from all of last week. Other school districts around the state are reporting similar jumps in cases.
Florida hospitals also are reporting record numbers of hospitalizations at more than 17,000 and of patients in ICUs at more than 3,600.
DeSantis, appearing at the opening of another Regeneron monoclonal antibody treatment clinic in Pembroke Pines, cited the Parents Bill of Rights law passed earlier this year as his authority to overrule school boards on behalf of parental rights.
That was the Legislature of Florida that said the parents are the ones that have ultimate responsibility for health, education and welfare, DeSantis said. And so this is not just something were making up. ... A parent has the right to send their kid to school in the way thats most healthy for their child.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended children age 2 and older wear masks due to the increased danger from the highly contagious Delta variant of the coronavirus. The Florida Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics has also pleaded with DeSantis to abandon his dangerous rhetoric against face masks in schools.
The governor on Thursday also appointed Mildred Russell, the former chair of the Alachua County GOP, to a spot on the county school board after a member was ousted

611,"The rise of Hot Rod Charlie as a contender for the 147th Kentucky Derby was just as unexpected as a local group's purchase of a share of the horse two years ago.
Roadrunner Racing 2018, a group of 11 members at La Quinta Country Club, broke its own unwritten rule against investing in yearling horses with the purchase of a stake in Hot Rod Charlie at a Florida sale in 2019.
Known in horse racing as a syndicate, or a group of people who come together to purchase ownership in a promising horse and then cover the annual costs to maintain the horse, the La Quinta group expected Hot Rod Charlie to be a sprinter, a horse that could excel at races under a mile.
Two years later, those La Quinta members all will be in Louisville, Ky., this week on the first Saturday in May to see if the story that wasn't supposed to happen has a fairytale ending.
""I'm only three or four years into this thing, (partner Greg Helm) a lot longer,"" said John Foster, one of the 11 members of the Roadrunner Racing 2018 group. ""But I have friends who have wanted to do this for 50 years. And the expletives? You don't deserve this. You get a horse and you go to the Kentucky Derby?
""It's crazy, because a lot of guys have been in it for a long time,"" Foster added. ""This just doesn't happen.""
One week before the running of the first leg of the Triple Crown, Hot Rod Charlie is 6-1 in the futures betting for the Kentucky Derby, behind only consensus favorite Essential Quality at 5-2. Jockey Flavien Prat will ride Hot Rod Charlie in the Kentucky Derby.
The La Quinta Country Club connection to the derby contender started with the demise of another local syndicate that was buying and racing horses. All were members of La Quinta Country Club, which has a roadrunner as its logo. Greg Helm, a member of that syndicate and a board member of Desert Classic Charities when that non-profit ran the Bob Hope Classic, started recruiting in 2018 for new members.
""We had about 10 couples here the first year. It was called Roadrunner Racing 2017,"" Helm said. ""And we did okay, but not great and so the following year a few people got out and few more people got in and we had six couples. And it's called Roadrunner Racing 2018.""
One of the new couples in the group was John Foster, a long-time president of the desert's PGA Tour event for Desert Classic Charities, and his wife Joan.
In addition to the Fosters and Greg Helm and his wife Glenna, other owners of the horse are Mike and Dina Dargis, Dave and Terrie Mileski, Skeeter and Suzie Holt and Suzie Burt.
Buying a yearling for the first time
The Roadrunner Racing 2018 group planned to buy interests in 2-year-old horses, working with a bloodstock agent – a kind of finder of potentially good racehorses – named Dennis O'Neill. But in 2019, O'Neill called Helm with a different offer, a chance to buy at least part of a yearling, a horse older than one year but not yet two years old.
""I said we've never bought a 1-year-old, so I don't know we'd want to do that,"" Helm said. ""And he said, well, it's a half-brother to Mitole, and Mitole was the champion sprinter of the year that year and was about to be named we thought the Eclipse winner for sprinters.""
A dark bay horse, Hot Rod Charlie shares the same dam as Mitole, Indian Miss. Hot Rod Charlie's ability to run more than a mile comes from his sire, Oxbow, which finished sixth in the 2013 Kentucky Derby and two weeks later won the Preakness Stakes.
Knowing Mitole was a winner of eight stakes races in 2018 and 2019, including the 2019 Breeders Cup Juvenile, Helm, as manager of the Roadrunners Racing 2018 group, immediately told O'Neill his group would buy half of the horse. The bloodstock agent then put together buyers for the rest of the horse, with 25% to a syndicate of fraternity brothers from Brown University in Rhode Island, and the final 25% by Bill Strauss, another long-time horse owner.
When the Kentucky-bred horse hit the auction floor, the bidding went to $110,000, meaning Roadrunner Racing 2018 was in for $55,000.
Helm is the only member of Roadrunner Racing 2018 who has previously owned a race horse and admits his experience and passion make him the choice for manager in the syndicate's operating regulations. Some in the group have some knowledge of horse racing as wagerers and fans, while others in the group are looking for a fun activity with friends and other country club members.
When it came time for the majority ownership group to name the horse, Helm said Foster had the perfect name. In horse racing tradition, part of the name comes from Hot Rod Charlie's bloodline, with one of its grandfathers called Indian Charlie.
""I just thought it would put a smile on your face. When you say it, it would put a smile on your face,"" Foster said. ""And it's kind of fun. I'm always thinking about the stretch and Trevor Denman (Southern California race track announcer). 'And off the turn, here comes Hot Rod Charlie.' It's not like Justify or Authentic.""
For all the buzz around Hot Rod Charlie and the Kentucky Derby, the horse was not an immediate star on the track. Starting in July of 2020, Hot Rod Charlie finished fourth, third and fifth in three starts in three months at Del Mar near San Diego.
""The thing you heard every time he ran was he's so immature, he's so immature,"" Foster said. ""I remember coming around the turn at Santa Anita and he's out looking at the stands like 'there are people out there.' He was real immature.""
There also was some question if the horse should be running longer races or running as a sprinter like his famous brother Mitole,
""We were looking for a successful less-than-a-mile racehorse,"" Helm said. ""He didn't break his maiden (win his first race) until his fourth race, but each race he got bigger and stronger and not so immature, smarter.""
A win, and a big break
That breakthrough victory came in a 1-mile race at Santa Anita race track in Arcadia in October 2020 and led to a surprising next step for Hot Rod Charlie.
With the COVID-19 pandemic hurting the horse racing industry with fewer horses running in many leadup races to the Breeders Cup last fall, organizers of the Breeders Cup were concerned about filling races for their two-day event, held in 2020 at Keeneland race track in Lexington, Ky. Organizers called Doug O'Neill, Hot Rod Charlie's trainer and the brother of the bloodstock agent who found the horse, and asked if he wanted his horse in the Breeders Cup Juvenile for 2-year-olds.
On the advice of O'Neill, the La Quinta syndicate and the other owners of the horse decided to spend the money for entry fees and transportation costs from Santa Anita to Lexington.
""We kind of rolled the dice on it,"" Helm said. ""On Breeders Cup Saturday all the (Roadrunners Racing 2018) owners were right here (on the balcony of the clubhouse at La Quinta Country Club) watching on that screen as Hot Rod Charlie went off at 94-1. And he finished second. He led until the final strides.""
The loss by a head to Essential Quality turned Hot Rod Charlie from an average West Coast horse to a Kentucky Derby contender. That was reinforced one month ago when Hot Rod Charlie, with jockey Joel Rosario on board, won the 1 3/16 mile Louisiana Derby, one of the races in the Derby Prep Series, where horses can earn points toward a Kentucky Derby start. The Kentucky Derby is raced at 1 1/4 miles.
All of the local owners of Hot Rod Charlie will be at Churchill Downs on May 1 for the race, with Foster joking his wife has already bought two big hats, a tradition on Derby Day. But Foster, Helm and the other owners are still amazed at the opportunity.
""There are 20,000 race horses born every year. Half of them are female, and I don't want to discount them but most don't race against males,"" Helm said. ""So there are 10,000 male horses, and 5,000 of them never see a race track for whatever reason.
""On the first Saturday in May, 20 of them make it to the Debry, come out of that starting gates,"" Helm said. ""It's pretty astounding, the odds. So it is pretty astounding that we find ourselves in this position.""

613,"Detroit Lions quarterback Jared Goff said he feels ""fine"" after testing positive for COVID-19, but is not sure if he can return to play in Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons. “I’m feeling good,"" Goff said in his weekly interview with 97.1 WXYT-FM. ""It’s pretty much a mild cold. I’m feeling fine. I had some symptoms pop up really Sunday night after the game, Monday morning. I said, 'You know what, I might as well make sure I’m good to go,' and sure enough I’m positive."" The Lions placed Goff and two others on the reserve/COVID-19 list Monday, bringing their COVID outbreak to 13 cases in 15 days. The NFL changed its health and safety protocols last week to allow vaccinated players to make a quicker return to play. Under the new guidelines, vaccinated players can clear protocols as soon as the day after they test positive for the virus so long as they are asymptomatic and their viral load is above a certain benchmark. Previously, players were required to quarantine for a minimum of 10 days, though vaccinated players could return sooner if they produced two negative COVID tests at least 24 hours apart. Goff, who is vaccinated, said he is not sure what his viral load is but will follow a course of ""rest, sleep, hydration (and) medicine"" in hopes of returning to the field this week.  ""I don’t even know exactly what it means, but I know the number is 35 that they’re looking for,"" he said. ""If you’re 35 or above you are good to go. I’m not quite sure what my number is yet, but that is the number they’re looking at. There’s a million ways you can try to get your number there by certain medications or certain vitamins and stuff like that, that can expedite the process to get yourself there to test negative."" The Lions activated running back Jamaal Williams and cornerback Mark Gilbert off the reserve/COVID list Monday but still have seven players in COVID protocols: Goff, offensive tackle Matt Nelson, safety Jalen Elliott, injured receiver Quintez Cephus and practice squad defensive players Nickell Robey-Coleman, Corey Ballentine and Tavante Beckett.

""I feel fine,"" he said. ""It’s mild cold symptoms. I feel totally fine. And it is interesting, though, I had the flu a couple weeks ago and they didn’t have a problem with me playing but you’re not allowed to play with this."" “I tested flu positive and I was in the building the next day and there was no issue."" Goff, in the midst of an up-and-down year with the Lions, played his best football of the season against the Cardinals. He completed 21 of 26 passes for 216 yards and three touchdowns, and the Lions (2-11-1) won for the second time in three weeks. ""I don’t know the chances (of playing this week),"" Goff said. ""I think I have a chance of testing negative as well as I have a chance of testing positive every day. I really don't know, so I’ll test every day and we’ll find out and if I happen to test negative in the next couple days, then yeah, sure there’s a chance.""

615,"A massive Intel computer chip factory is a major win in Ohio's push to resurrect its status as a national and global manufacturing center.
""It's a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Ohio,"" said Ryan Augsburger, president of the Ohio Manufacturers' Association.
It's akin to when Maryville landed Honda four decades ago, something that Gov. James A. Rhodes said was one of his biggest achievements as governor.
What makes the Licking County area a good location for the Intel plant?
In many ways, Intel's selection of the Licking County site highlights the state's strengths during a pandemic that has revealed supply chain weaknesses that has troubled everything from automakers to grocery store chains.
Greater Columbus is within a day's drive of 46% of U.S. manufacturing, said Keely Croxton, a professor of logistics at Ohio State University. And that makes sense for a plant that makes semiconductors since there are auto-making facilities in Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Indiana.
""A chip is a small component into what makes a car, but it's the one everybody is talking about,"" Croxton said. ""I think there are lots of logical reasons why central Ohio, the state of Ohio, is a good location.""
When a large company selects a place such as Ohio, it gets people thinking of Ohio as a manufacturing hub, she said. They're not just thinking about Silicon Valley, she said, but also Ohio as a place for technology companies to invest.
""This is about reshoring an entire industry that we almost lost that supports everything we make in this state, from washers and dryers to cars,"" Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said.
And recent events during the pandemic have highlighted issues existing in our supply chain, especially when production is coming from overseas, Croxton said. ""Particularly with semiconductors, it's a national security issue,"" she said.
""The pandemic has delivered the largest opportunity for American manufacturers in the last half-century by spotlighting our country's overreliance on foreign goods. Strategic investments in targeted sectors – including the semiconductor industry – are a matter of national security,"" Augsburger said.
""While investment in facilities is critical, an equal emphasis must be placed on workforce skills and available labor. Fortunately, Ohio has a head start in this area, as well – including a statewide network of industry sector partnerships and state support for industry-recognized credentials.""
Edward ""Ned"" Hill, an economics professor at Ohio State University, said Intel's decision shows the company believes that Greater Columbus can attract the technical talent it is after. ""The schools in all of Ohio can produce the talent they need on an ongoing basis,"" he said.
Despite decades of plant closings and jobs losses that have hurt Ohio communities large and small, manufacturing remains a vital part of the state's economy.
In fact, the value of the state's manufacturing output has never been higher, said Jamie Karl, managing director of communications services for the Manufacturers' Association.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, Ohio manufacturing's gross domestic product was more than $118.3 billion (annualized) in the third quarter of 2021, a record high, up from $116.9 billion in the second quarter and $112.4 billion in the fourth quarter of 2019, before the start of the pandemic.
Karl said 670,000 workers are employed in manufacturing in Ohio now. That's 30,000 fewer than before the COVID-19 pandemic took hold in March 2020.
""You'd think it reflects poorly on industry,"" Karl said. But that's not the case, he said.
""The job postings are out there. The applicants are not,"" he said.
Those numbers are still far below from what they used to be decades ago. Ohio's manufacturing employment peaked in 1969, at 1.48 million.
Greater Columbus' manufacturing employment was 120,660 in 1973, Hill said. By 2020, the number had fallen to 73,908.
Zach Schiller, research director at the left-leaning Policy Matters Ohio, said that while Ohio ranks third in manufacturing employment in the U.S., behind only California and Texas, it still hasn't even regained the jobs it lost during the pandemic, let alone the tens of thousands lost before that.
""We had a million manufacturing jobs 20 years ago,"" Schiller said. Having a strong manufacturing sector remains a worthwhile goal for the state, he said.

But Augsburger said ""Ohio has been and is going to continue to be a manufacturing state.""
Other recent high-profile manufacturing projects in Ohio include:
Exercise equipment maker Peloton said it will create 2,174 jobs as part of a $400 million facility in Wood County south of Toledo to make bikes and treadmills starting in 2023.
Steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs invested $1 billion into its hot-briquetted iron facility in Toledo. That was completed in 2020.
Cleveland-based paint maker Sherwin Williams is building a 36-story headquarters tower on that city's Public Square.
Biotech company Amgen broke ground in late 2021 on a $365 million pharmaceutical packaging facility near Beech Road and Route 161 in New Albany. It will employ 400.
American Nitrile is spending more than $100 million to convert a Grove City warehouse into a facility to make latex-free gloves for healthcare and other workers.
SK Food Group announced in November that it plans a second Columbus-area food plant on the Far West Side that will employ more than 300 workers.
The Jackson Center travel trailer maker Airstream, recently opened its largest expansion in its history.
The semiconductor factory adds to that manufacturing legacy, said Gov. Mike DeWine.
""This is a huge signal to the country and the world about what's going on in Ohio today,"" DeWine told The Dispatch this month. ""We remain a manufacturing state and we're looking to the future.""
That so much of the chip production has been shipped overseas is a national security issue that needs to be addressed, DeWine said.
""I'm very proud Ohio is going to be a part of the solution,"" he said
According to the National Association of Manufacturers, producers in Ohio account for 16% of the total economic output in the state, employing 12.74% of the workforce. The average annual compensation was $78,108 in 2019.
In 2020, Ohio's manufacturers exported $40.5 billion in goods. That was 90% of all goods exported from the state.
Hill said durable goods production — of which computer chips are a part — make up 6.9% of the national gross domestic product but 9.4% of Ohio's.
""We are right in the middle of the durable goods manufacturing belt,"" Hill said, including aircraft components and appliances.
Alison Goebel, executive director for the Greater Ohio Policy Center, a nonprofit group that pushes for urban revitalization in the state, said the state has a long history of manufacturing and innovation, so it doesn't surprise her that Ohio was a serious contender for the computer chip site.
""We have the history and the know-how of how to make things here,"" Goebel said.
""Certainly the location benefits it,"" she said, including the large interstate highway network, rail lines and proximity to deep water ports. ""That all makes sense.""
Also, extreme weather events aren't as dramatic as in other parts of the country, she said.
Columbus also has cheaper electricity prices than a state such as New York, where Intel said it had considered building in Albany. Hill also said access to water is important, and for that reason questioned why Intel was building two new chip plants in Arizona.

616,"NEW HAVEN, Conn. and NEW YORK, Feb. 14, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd. (NYSE: BHVN) and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), today announced positive top-line results from an Asia-Pacific, Phase 3 clinical trial of rimegepant in 1,431 adults for the acute treatment of migraine. Led by BioShin Limited, a subsidiary of Biohaven in China and South Korea, the randomized, regional, multi-center study met the co-primary endpoints evaluating the efficacy and safety of the orally dissolving tablet (ODT) formulation of rimegepant, an oral calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist.
This is the fourth positive Phase 3 study of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine and the first to be conducted in Asia Pacific. The study met its co-primary endpoints of freedom from pain (p<0.0001) and freedom from most bothersome migraine–associated symptom (MBS) including either nausea, phonophobia or photophobia (p<0.0001) at 2-hours following a single oral dose of rimegepant. In the study, a single oral dose of rimegepant 75 mg provided significant relief of migraine symptoms and return to normal function at 2 hours and delivered sustained efficacy that lasted up to 48 hours for many patients. Rimegepant showed a favorable safety and tolerability profile among study participants that was consistent with prior clinical trial results in the United States. Detailed data from the study will be presented at future medical meetings to help inform ongoing and future research.
Under the terms of the collaboration agreement between Biohaven and Pfizer, Pfizer has commercialization rights to rimegepant in markets outside of the U.S. Biohaven continues to lead research and development globally and retains the U.S. market. Rimegepant is commercialized as Nurtec® ODT in the U.S. and is the only oral CGRP receptor antagonist approved for both the acute and preventive treatment of migraine in adults. An application for the approval of rimegepant is currently under review by the European Medicines Agency with a decision expected in the first half of 2022. Rimegepant is approved for the acute treatment of migraine in Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, and for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine in Israel.
Vlad Coric, M.D., Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of Biohaven commented, ""These top-line trial results clearly show the consistent clinical profile of rimegepant to relieve migraine symptoms and return patients to normal function. Through our partnership with Pfizer, we are committed to rapidly expanding the availability of rimegepant to patients around the world, particularly in Asia Pacific where migraine is a common disease and a leading cause of disability.""
""It is very exciting to see the completion and positive results of the first Phase 3 study of rimegepant in Asia Pacific,"" said Nick Lagunowich, Global President, Pfizer Internal Medicine. ""With millions of patients in the region impacted by this debilitating neurological disease, these results provide hope for a potentially new effective acute treatment for patients in need. We are moving as quickly as possible in our effort to get this potential treatment into the hands of patients, and we look forward to working with regulatory agencies around the world to do so.""
Professor Shengyuan Yu, Principal Investigator of the study and Director of the Department of Neurology, Chinese PLA General Hospital, said, ""We need new, effective and safe treatment options to help improve the lives of our migraine patients in Asia and are encouraged by the positive results of this study.""
Donnie McGrath, M.D., Executive Chairman of Biohaven's wholly-owned subsidiary in China, BioShin, added, ""The results from this study demonstrate the effectiveness of rimegepant and highlight the potential impact for patients in Asia Pacific, if approved. I'm so proud of the BioShin R&D team who executed this study.""
About RimegepantRimegepant targets a key component of migraine by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic cascade that results in a migraine attack. Rimegepant was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the trade name Nurtec ODT for the acute treatment of migraine in February 2020 and for the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in May 2021. A single dose of 75 mg Nurtec ODT provides fast pain relief, significant pain reduction and return to normal function, and has a lasting effect of up to 48 hours in many patients. Nurtec ODT is taken orally as needed, up to 18 doses/month to stop migraine attacks or taken every other day to help prevent migraine attacks and reduce the number of monthly migraine days. Nurtec ODT does not have addiction potential and is not associated with medication overuse headache or rebound headache.
About NURTEC ODTNURTEC ODT (rimegepant) is the first and only calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) receptor antagonist available in a quick-dissolve ODT formulation that is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the acute treatment of migraine with or without aura and the preventive treatment of episodic migraine in adults. The activity of the neuropeptide CGRP is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. NURTEC ODT is a CGRP receptor antagonist that works by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the CGRP neuropeptide. For more information about NURTEC ODT, visit www.nurtec.com.
IndicationNURTEC ODT orally disintegrating tablets is a prescription medicine that is used to treat migraine in adults. It is for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura and the preventive treatment of episodic migraine. It is not known if NURTEC ODT is safe and effective in children.
Important Safety InformationDo not take NURTEC ODT if you are allergic to NURTEC ODT (rimegepant) or any of its ingredients. Before you take NURTEC ODT, tell your healthcare provider (HCP) about all your medical conditions, including if you:have liver problems, have kidney problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant, breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your HCP about all the medicines you take, including prescription and over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and herbal supplements.
NURTEC ODT may cause serious side effects including allergic reactions, trouble breathing and rash. This can happen days after you take NURTEC ODT. Call your HCP or get emergency help right away if you have swelling of the face, mouth, tongue, or throat or trouble breathing. This occurred in less than 1% of patients treated with NURTEC ODT.
The most common side effects of NURTEC ODT were nausea (2.7%) and stomach pain/indigestion (2.4%). These are not the only possible side effects of NURTEC ODT. Tell your HCP if you have any side effects.
You are encouraged to report side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA.  Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1–800–FDA–1088 or report side effects to Biohaven at 1–833–4NURTEC.

About MigraineMore than one billion people worldwide suffer from migraine and the World Health Organization classifies migraine as one of the 10 most disabling medical illnesses. Migraine is characterized by debilitating attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including pulsating headaches of moderate to severe pain intensity that can be associated with nausea or vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light (photophobia). There is a significant unmet need for new treatments as more than 90 percent of people with migraine are unable to work or function normally during an attack.
CGRP Receptor AntagonismSmall molecule CGRP receptor antagonists represent a novel class of drugs for the treatment of migraine. CGRP receptor antagonists work by reversibly blocking CGRP receptors, thereby inhibiting the biologic activity of the CGRP neuropeptide. For acute treatment, this unique mode of action potentially offers an alternative to other agents, particularly for patients who have contraindications to the use of triptans or who have a poor response to triptans or are intolerant to them. CGRP signal-blocking therapies have not been associated with medication overuse headache (MOH) or rebound headaches which limits the clinical utility of other acute treatments due to increases in migraine attacks that result from frequent use.

623,"Lou Barletta, a former congressman from Pennsylvania, fierce critic of illegal immigration, and vocal ally of former President Donald Trump’s, is moving toward a potential run for governor by forming a political group focused on state issues.
The new group, ChangePA(C), aims to emphasize Barletta’s views on Pennsylvania government, he said. It will also allow him to raise money and his political profile as he considers another run for office in 2022.
Barletta, the GOP nominee for U.S. Senate in 2018, blasted Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, a flash point for many conservatives.
“As a lifelong Pennsylvanian, I’ve been disappointed in the leadership out of Harrisburg for the last eight years, but it’s been especially horrifying in the last year alone,” Barletta said in a statement announcing the formation of the political action committee and shared first with The Inquirer. “Governor Wolf’s handling of the coronavirus response has been shameful.”
He cited the Wolf administration’s policy ordering that COVID-19 patients be readmitted into nursing homes — though it’s unclear if that policy led to an outbreak — hammered the state’s vaccine rollout, and said “businesses were crushed by draconian lockdowns.”
“People are demanding change in Harrisburg, and I’ve had a lot of encouragement to get involved,” Barletta said.
A Muhlenberg College poll this month showed a sharp divide on Wolf’s handling of the pandemic: 40% approved, and 41% disapproved.
The web site for Barletta’s new PAC emphasizes issues such as fighting illegal immigration and environmental regulations, supporting police and the coal and gas industries, and tightening election laws, citing “widespread mistrust,” in elections — mistrust fueled by false claims by Trump and his supporters.
Barletta’s new PAC mirrors a step taken by former U.S. Attorney Bill McSwain, who is also moving toward a run for governor in what could be a crowded GOP field aiming to replace Wolf, who is term-limited.
Barletta first made his political brand as mayor of Hazleton in Northeast Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County, drawing national attention for his hard-line stands against illegal immigration. He was one of the first members of Congress to endorse Trump and later became a prominent surrogate, often referred to by the president as half of his “thunder and lightning” team in Pennsylvania.
But Trump’s backing wasn’t enough for Barletta in his 2018 run against Sen. Bob Casey. Amid a Democratic wave, Barletta lost by 13 percentage points and struggled to raise money. National groups largely wrote off the race, despite Pennsylvania’s usually competitive politics.
Barletta’s allies argue that as a former statewide candidate who won 2.1 million votes (43% that year), he starts with name recognition that gives him a jump on the rest of the GOP field. They contend it will be hard for others to break through given the vast collection of Democrats and Republicans competing for voters’ attention in gubernatorial and Senate races next year.
It is still very early, with few voters tuning in to a race some 18 months away. But Barletta topped a field of five potential Republican candidates for governor, according to a February poll from the Harrisburg-based Susquehanna Polling & Research. Barletta had support from 20% of Republican voters, the survey found, and State Sen. Doug Mastriano ranked second with 11% support. The sample included just 272 registered Republicans and the vast majority, 60%, were undecided.
Some 67% of Republican voters were familiar with Barletta, according to the poll, though about half of the people who knew of him had no opinion of him. Overall, 23% of Republicans saw him favorably.
The governor’s seat is attracting a wide range of Republican interest. McSwain and Mastriano are seen as potential contenders, and party insiders are also watching U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser, former Lt.Gov. Jim Cawley, and others.
State Attorney General Josh Shapiro is widely seen as the early Democratic front-runner for governor. jtamari@inquirer.com

626,"WASHINGTON, March 2, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- The United States Postal Service announced today that it has delivered more than 270 million COVID-19 test kits to American households as part of President Biden's plan to distribute free at-home tests to Americans for free. The Postal Service reported over 68 million test kit packages (with four tests per kit) have been shipped to American households across all states, Tribes and territories; each package contains four individual test kits. On average, it takes just 1.2 days for the Postal Service to deliver a test kit package once it has been received from the manufacturer, kitted and entered into the mailstream. On Tuesday, Feb. 22, the Postal Service delivered over 6 million COVID-19 test kit packages — the highest single day volume delivered since shipping began at the end of January.
""There are few assignments the Postal Service has received that better exemplify our public service mission than the request of the Biden Administration to deliver America's COVID-19 test kits,"" said Postmaster General and Chief Executive Officer Louis DeJoy. ""It is a major point of pride throughout our organization to have met our own performance expectations and those of the public. We are grateful for the strong collaboration of our partners across the federal government, including the White House, the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense. Thank you to our Postal Service employees, our union and management association partners for so effectively and efficiently delivering such strong performance across the board.""
COVID-19 Test Kit Delivery by the Numbers:Over 270 million – tests packaged and shipped to American households across the country. Over 68 million – packages delivered to households across all states, Tribes and territories to date. 1.2 average days to delivery Over 6 million – number of test kit packages delivered by the U.S. Postal Service on Tuesday, Feb. 22, the highest single day volume since delivery began end of January. Over 68 million orders for free rapid at-home COVID-19 test kits have been placed through the Biden Administration's covidtests.gov, an easy-to-use consumer website established and managed by USPS in partnership with the United States Digital Service, since the website was launched on Dec. 21, 2021. The Postal Service immediately pivoted from a successful 2021 peak holiday season to focus on the delivery of America's COVID-19 test kits. Quick negotiations with the postal unions enabled the retention of many of the seasonal staff who were reassigned from their holiday roles, and new annex facilities acquired in the year prior were rapidly reconfigured to ensure workspace and storage capacity could handle the immediate influx of millions of test kits daily.
Strong interagency collaboration between the Postal Service, White House, Department of Health and Human Services and Department of Defense has been a key factor in the success of this mission. Coordinated efforts included test kit inventory flow management from manufacturers to USPS Surface Transportation Centers, and then onto 48 Postal processing facilities to pack, label and ship.
Test kit orders in the continental U.S. are sent through First Class Package Service, and by Priority Mail to Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. Territories and APO/FPO/DPO addresses.
Once an order is placed on the covidtests.gov website, the requestor receives an order confirmation email and additional status updates as the package is shipped. Requestors can track their package online and receive status updates via the Informed Delivery notification feature.
Order your free at-home COVID-19 test kit at covidtests.gov or by calling 1-800-232-0233 (TTY 1-888-720-7489). 
The Postal Service generally receives no tax dollars for operating expenses and relies on the sale of postage, products and services to fund its operations.

Attorney fills vacancy on planning commission
A former attorney for Cobb County was appointed on Feb. 9 to replace Cobb Planning Commission member Judy Williams, who has died from COVID-19.
Williams also served on Cobbs Board of Zoning Appeals, according to Cobb Commissioner JoAnn K. Birrell, who nominated Deborah Dance to take the place of Williams.
Also, Williams served 28 years as a Cobb County employee before, during her retirement, being appointed to serve on the BZA and the Cobb Planning Commission.
Williams was a mentor to many, including myself, and a true friend and confidant. She will be greatly missed, Birrell said.
Of Dance, Birrell said, She will step right in and hit the ground running. Deborah is very knowledgeable not only in zoning but all areas and will be a great asset to the Planning Commission board.
Dance retired after serving for 24 years in the Cobb County Attorneys Office, according to a Cobb County statement. She was county attorney from 2013 to 2019.
Then Dance held an of counsel position with a governmental law firm in Cumming and currently consults on legal matters.

633,"Dec. 28 - The Penguins game originally scheduled for Friday in Ottawa has been postponed.
The NHL, which is heavily reliant on ticket sales for revenue, made the decision ""due to current attendance restrictions in certain Canadian cities."" Eight other games scheduled to be played in Canadian cities were also postponed. No makeup dates have been announced.
The Penguins have now seen five games postponed as the NHL deals with a new wave of COVID-19 and the various issues stemming from the virus. Games against New Jersey and Philadelphia at PPG Paints Arena were nixed before the holiday break. Now, this week's entire slate has been wiped out. The club was supposed play at Boston on Monday, at Toronto on Wednesday and at Ottawa on Friday.
The Penguins have not played since a 3-2 win in New Jersey on Dec. 19. They are next scheduled to take the ice at PPG Paints Arena against the San Jose Sharks on Jan. 2.
Across the league, more than 60 games (and counting) have been postponed. As a result, the NHL has pulled player participation from the Olympics. The three-week February break when many NHL players were scheduled to be in Beijing will now be used to restructure the schedule.
Joseph enters protocol just hours after he's recalled
Penguins defensive prospect Pierre-Olivier Joseph was supposed to be one of the reinforcements filling a void after six Pittsburgh players were placed into the COVID-19 protocol. Instead, he's now sidelined with the virus as well.
Just hours after the Penguins announced Joseph was one of four players called up from the AHL affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton to join the taxi squad, the 22-year-old blue liner produced a positive test.
The others sidelined by the virus are forwards Teddy Blueger, Evan Rodrigues and Dominik Simon, defensemen John Marino and Mike Matheson and starting goalie Tristan Jarry. To this point, coach Mike Sullivan said all players are experiencing mild symptoms or are entirely asymptomatic.
The other three players the Penguins added to the taxi squad joined the NHL club in Cranberry for practice on Tuesday. Power forward prospect Kasper Björkqvist skated on the fourth line in a trio that also featured center Brian Boyle and right wing Sam Lafferty. Juuso Riikola skated alongside defenseman Mark Friedman in the third pair. Third goalie Louis Domingue manned one crease opposite backup goalie Casey DeSmith.
At Tuesday's practice, the team featured 12-to-13 healthy forwards, six defensemen and two goalies. Evgeni Malkin rotated in with Bjorkqvist and Boyle on the fourth line. Sullivan said on Monday that the star center likely will need more time to recover from offseason knee surgery before he can play.
Pens lines/ pairs at practice:
Guentzel  -  Crosby  -  Rust
Heinen- Carter  -  Kapanen

COVID quarantine could be revised
After the Center for Disease Control adjusted its COVID-related quarantine guidelines for individuals who test positive, many professional sports leagues are following suit.
The NFL and the player's association are nearing a change that will shorten the quarantine time for individuals in COVID-19 protocols from 10 to five days, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported on Tuesday. The NBA has likewise revised its protocol. Vaccinated NBA players and coaches who are asymptomatic can now clear quarantine after six days if COVID-19 testing data shows they're no longer at risk to be infectious.
According to SportsNet's Elliott Friedman, the NHL is having discussions about possibly adapting its protocol. The NHL currently requires most players to isolate for 10 days.
One challenge is that the NHL straddles a border and Canada has generally been stricter with its COVID-related policies. For example, because of rules from the Canadian government, individuals who test positive are not permitted to enter the country until 14 days after their first positive test. Such was the case with Sullivan earlier this year. He completed his NHL-mandated 10-day isolation period in time to coach a few games in the United States, however, he had to sit out one more in Canada.
Asked if the NHL should consider altering its protocol, Sullivan said, ""With each passing day, I think the medical world learns more about what they're dealing with and how to deal with it. For me, it just makes sense that protocols are adjusted based on what they learn, based on new information, new studies and what the data is suggesting.""
Under the newest guidelines, people who test positive for the virus can exit isolation after just five days, instead of 10, so long as they continue to wear masks around others and are not experiencing any symptoms. The change was made after new studies suggested people who recover from the virus aren't contagious as long as originally thought.
""My hope is that all of us heed the advice of the medical world and the experts,"" the Penguins coach continued. ""They know a whole lot more about it than we do. That's the way I look at it.""

635,"A Canadian official who caught heat for visiting the Coachella Valley over the holidays — even though citizens had been advised to stay home to reduce the spread of COVID-19 — has resigned.
Saskatchewan Highway Minister Joe Hargrave stepped down last week amid criticism for a trip that he claimed was for him and his wife to finalize the sale of their desert home.
""You know hindsight is 20/20 and now I wish I hadn't gone but you know we felt at the time our home there was vacant 10 months and probably going to be vacant another 10 months or a year and we should sell it before something happens to it, like somebody breaks-in,"" Hargrave told The Canadian Press on Friday.
The Coachella Valley has traditionally attracted thousands of Canadians during the winter. When the pandemic first struck the United States, many Canadians went home out of concern for their health care coverage, and those concerns and border restrictions are keeping visitor numbers down again this winter.
Property records indicate Hargrave owns a four-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot home in the gated Terra Lago community in Indio. According to the real estate site Redfin, the property was listed for sale for $489,000 and is currently under contract.
Critics contend that Hargrave's home wasn't listed for sale until four days after the couple departed Canada and tha they were actually taking a vacation.
Hargrave, who denied those allegations, was expected to self-isolate for 14 days in Saskatchewan upon his return.
Saskatchewan Premier Scott Moe's office said Hargrave will remain in the Saskatchewan Party caucus as the legislature member for Prince Albert Carlton.

",Canadian leader resigns after trip
636,"Sep. 1 - Sixty percent of Clatsop County residents are vaccinated against the  coronavirus.
The county views the mark as progress, but also a sign the outreach has a ways to go.
The county has set a goal of having 70% of the population  -  27,533 people  -  vaccinated to try to reach herd immunity against the virus. The county said 23,835 people  -  60%  -  were vaccinated as of Wednesday.
With the highly transmissible delta variant leading to a surge in illnesses and hospitalizations, the county doesn't know if the original 70% target will be as effective as intended.
""At this point, the more (people) that are vaccinated the better,"" Tom Bennett, a county spokesman, said.
Vaccination rates in the county have followed Oregon's overall arc, the county noted: high demand when vaccines first became available in the winter, followed by a plummet in spring and summer once all of the people eager to get a vaccine had already done so.
At peak, with the county's weekly mass-vaccination clinics, combined with shots administered in hospitals and pharmacies, doses were getting into thousands of arms a week. Now the number is consistently in the low hundreds.
There are signs that this trend is turning around. In the week ending Friday, the Public Health Department saw about 400 people get a vaccine, up from 200 per week in July, the county said, attributing the increase to an awareness of the dangers posed by the delta variant.
Bennett said that perhaps seeing friends and family contract COVID-19 has helped people realize the seriousness of the virus. ""The evidence is pretty clear that even if you contract the virus and you're vaccinated, you're likely to get far less sick,"" he said.
Among Oregon's 36 counties, Clatsop ranked ninth in vaccination rates, according to the Oregon Health Authority.
The health authority reported 24 new virus cases for the county on Wednesday and eight new cases on Tuesday. Since the pandemic began, the county had recorded 1,880 virus cases and 13 deaths as of early Wednes

Flag disposal
In partnership with the National Association of Counties, the National Flag Foundation, Clinton County has installed a flag retirement box, at no cost to the county, at the Clinton County Courthouse (Administration Office, Suite 2100). Flags should be folded respectfully before being placed in the box.
The United States Flag Code prescribes flag etiquette — everything from flying it near other flags to instructions on how to raise and lower it. ""The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem of display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning,"" says the code.
Members of VFW will be responsible for the proper disposal of the worn flags.
The National Association of Counties (NACo) unites America's 3,069 county governments. Founded in 1935, NACo brings county officials together to advocate with a collective voice on national policy, exchange ideas and build new leadership skills, pursue transformational county solutions, enrich the public's understanding of county government and exercise exemplary leadership in public service.

645,"Chase Kirby's friends kept texting, kept asking him to go.
It was early March, just days before the Trinity High School Wolves' one and only football game of the season after the pandemic lockdown. But Chase, a strapping 6-foot, 210-pounder who had played defensive end and linebacker, wasn't so sure he wanted to be there.
""They're probably gonna feel bad for me or something,"" he said. ""I just don't like that kind of vibe.""

For the 18-year-old Chase, football had felt like a ticket to a different life, a future beyond this remote town of 3,100 people deep in California's northern forests. He planned to play football at a community college and hoped to get noticed by a bigger school.
But in early February, he rose before the sun for a 5 a.m. shift at the local sawmill, pulling and stacking freshly cut pieces of Douglas and white fir over and over again. It was hard, repetitive work. He liked it.
He was standing in front of a moving conveyor belt when a few pieces of wood got stuck. He grabbed one just as the machine grabbed it, too. He didn't have time to let go. In an instant, the machine had his arm and was yanking him forward.
He let out a scream.
--
Eleven months earlier, after the COVID-19 pandemic shut down in-person classes, Chase halfheartedly finished his junior year, then went to work for the summer, building a house, erecting fences, doing yardwork -- the kind of physical labor that keeps him in shape.
""It was either hang out with my friends or make money,"" he said. ""That's basically what everybody did in this town. They decided to go just make some money because of COVID.""
Weaverville, an old Gold Rush town, sits beneath the snow-covered granite peaks of the Trinity Alps Wilderness, four hours north of San Francisco. The area is so synonymous with the forest that the Trinity County Board of Supervisors last year considered formally making it a crime to kill Bigfoot -- whose legend draws tourists the region now depends upon.
It's a beautiful land, where many people struggle. Before the pandemic, the poverty rate in Trinity County was nearly double the national average. The population is shrinking, and the economy is increasingly reliant not on logging or mining -- occupations that have always had a certain mythos here -- but upon marijuana cultivation.
The federal government owns more than 75% of the land in Trinity County, which tends to be a sore subject here. A once thriving lumber industry cratered in the early 1990s for a variety of reasons: recession, changing technology, timber harvesting restrictions imposed on federal lands to protect the northern spotted owl.
A generation earlier, Trinity County had 28 sawmills. Now, the only one left is Trinity River Lumber Co., where Chase worked. The sawmill, which opened in 1947, is like so many here: a survivor.
In 2009, longtime resident Jim French was driving north of town when he saw a huge plume of smoke rising in the direction of the mill. A welder's torch had sparked a blaze and the place burned to the ground. French pulled over to the side of the road and wept.
The retired superintendent of the Trinity Alps Unified School District said the mill paid for Weaverville students' baseball and football uniforms. It gave scholarship money. It helped build the local performing arts center.
""Any time a kid needs something, you go to that mill,"" French said, his voice cracking with emotion.
As for the fire, ""it was like someone had poured gasoline on your freaking heart. But they rebuilt it. And they stayed. They could have easily walked away from us, but they have a heart for this place.""
A heart for this place. That seems to be how the town, and its school, endure.
In the summer of 2018, Chase's campus sheltered refugees from the deadly Carr fire. The next summer, the county shut down Weaverville Elementary and Trinity High School after the discovery of toxic black mold; high schoolers are still learning in portable buildings, and the gym where Chase, who was also a varsity basketball player, once competed remains gutted.
Trinity High School students came back to their classrooms in August amid the pandemic, but Chase started his senior year at home, on independent study. His mom provides in-home care for older people; he didn't want to risk passing on the coronavirus to her and then her clients.
But he hated working, once again, on lessons handed out in paper packets. And he missed sports. He came back to class in September but struggled to catch up, especially in math.
Across California, youth sports did not come back. Football coaches in Weaverville had the boys lift weights a few times a week, just to give them something to do, said junior varsity coach Ryan Gogan.
Grades tanked. To be eligible to play, students must have at least a 2.0 GPA and not be flunking any classes.
""A lot of the guys, sports are the only thing that keep them focused on the classroom,"" the coach said. ""It's been terrible academically for a lot of these students.""
Mike Garcia, Chase's former defensive coach, said that, often, ""these kids need football more than football needs them. To get that taken away from them? It's hard to keep them motivated.""
""There's a blue-collar mentality here,"" added Garcia, who works as an electrical lineman for the Trinity Public Utility District. ""Kids are athletes, and they go to work at the mill. They work with their hands. ... When I watch these kids graduate, most want to get out of this small town and see what it's like in a big city. You sit back, and after a couple years, a lot come back.""
In the 2019 season, the Wolves won one game and lost nine, and players and coaches had hoped 2020 would be their chance for a comeback. But the sports shutdown persisted, even as Chase's coaches were ""blowing up my phone"" telling him to hold out hope they'd play again.
""They kept saying we'll be back,"" Chase said. ""September came around, and they were like, it's going to happen in September. It didn't. Then October, I was like -- OK. November?""
In mid-October, he turned 18 and made a decision: He quit school.
Sports are ""basically the only reason I go to school other than my friends,"" he said. ""That's the whole reason I dropped out.""
--
Chase started working at Burger King and planned to take his high school equivalency test in the spring. He would save up some money and hoped to attend Shasta College in Redding.
Then a job opened up where his father and older brother and so many others in town made their living: the lumber mill. He started work in January.
Chase was nearing the end of his shift on Feb. 11 when he tried to dislodge the wood stuck on the conveyor belt. He kept his hand away from the belt, but the machine pulled back hard when he grabbed one piece, ensnaring his fingers and tugging his arm in.
Chase grappled with it, jerking and tugging as if in a fight with the biggest, meanest offensive lineman he'd faced in his life.
""When it pulled me in,"" he said, ""I was like, 'OK, I'm not gonna cry and die right here.' ... I'm screaming for help, but at the same time, I was pulling back. I was fighting the machine the whole time.""
Other employees untangled Chase's shredded, bloody arm. The equipment had yanked him all the way up to his right shoulder, tearing through his bicep, piercing his forearm, snapping his humerus. He thought his hand was disconnected.
It took 45 minutes, he said, for one of the county's only ambulances to arrive from Hayfork -- 30 miles to the south on winding mountain roads -- then another hour to drive east to Mercy Medical Center in Redding.
Dee Sanders, the general manager for Trinity River Lumber, said there had never been an accident in the area of the mill where Chase worked. ""It's always difficult to see anyone who works for us get hurt,"" he said. ""We just pray he's able to heal up and get back and live a normal life.""
There were two surgeries. Doctors had to clean sawdust from the wounds. They removed 60% of his bicep. They put a metal plate and a rod in his arm. Chase said he was intubated but woke up in a panic on the operating table, unable to open his eyes or move his body, feeling as if he was choking.
""I guess I started crying,"" he said. ""A tear shed, and they pulled the tube out of my throat. Then I don't remember anything. I guess I just fell asleep.""
Twelve days later, football practice started again.
--
In March, with the coronavirus more in check, youth athletes were again allowed to compete in California. But the Trinity Wolves' far-flung league, which includes schools three and four hours away, had canceled the season. So, they split their own team in half. They would play themselves and have a homecoming game.
Before the game, coach Scott Merryman said it would be bittersweet to be playing again but without Chase.
Chase could be headstrong, and they didn't always get along, Merryman said, but ""if he knew he was right, he wasn't afraid to let you know. And I had utmost respect for that. I miss that.""
He had learned of Chase's accident from his daughter, who works at the mill. Merryman was empathetic. Just over a year earlier, he had his own lumber-related brush with death.
On Nov. 4, 2019, Merryman, a California Highway Patrol officer, was eastbound on Highway 299 when a speeding vehicle whipped past. Merryman started a U-turn to go after it.
A logging truck smashed into the driver's side of his patrol car at 47 mph.
He had a traumatic brain injury, punctured a lung in three places, lacerated his liver and fractured his spine. But, in time, he returned to coaching.
During practice, Merryman bundled up in a thick sweatshirt because he now has four titanium ribs. The metal makes him cold.
Jim Pindell, the high school counselor, has a logging story to share, too.
When Pindell, 70, was in his 20s, he worked as a logger. A co-worker was clearing brush with a swing blade, and it slipped out of his hand. Pindell threw up his right hand as it flew toward him. The blade sliced halfway through it.
He nearly bled to death. The doctor told his mother: ""You tell Jim to find a different line of work.""
To this day, he can't fully move his fingers. He used to play saxophone, but no more.
Now, Pindell visits Chase every few days. ""We share war stories,"" he said. ""I shared with him my own moving on with life, and he's all about that.
""He's a survivor, that one.""
A few days before homecoming, Chase was sitting in his family's wooded backyard off Mill Street, where blackberry vines grow wild.
His wrist was in a brace. The skin on his right arm was scabbed and pink. On the back of his arm, stitches ran from his armpit to his elbow. Little by little, he made progress in trying to ball his hand into a fist. Doctors told him that if he couldn't do so in a month, he never would be able to again.
""I should have been dead,"" he said. ""I really should have. It should have pulled me in and snapped my neck or ripped my arm off or something. But I got really lucky.""
Now, with homecoming approaching, Chase wrestled with whether to show up.
""Every now and then I get a little emotional about it,"" he said. ""But I'm a really strong person. It's just a weird feeling, because I like my body, obviously. I do stuff all the time, so not being in control of a certain part in my body just ... doesn't feel right, you know?
""But I'm just keeping my head up. ... I'm gonna do me and prove everybody wrong and try to get my full potential back in my arm and do what people don't think I can.""
In May, he'll take his high school equivalency test, he says. From there, he's not sure what happens. He is considering trade school and would enjoy working in construction, but that depends on how his arm and hand heal.
On March 12, a 45-degree Friday night, the Trinity Wolves took the field for homecoming. Half wore red; the other, white. Teammates, and, for just one night, rivals.
Families pulled up around the dirt track, sitting in lawn chairs on the beds of pickup trucks. It would usually be standing-room-only in the bleachers, but capacity was limited by social distancing. That didn't matter, though, to the overjoyed crowd.
""We're just trying to enjoy every moment today because they can see how quickly things can be taken from them,"" said Heidi Rupp, who has two sons on the team. ""I'm going to cheer as loud as I possibly can to make up for the 10 games I should have been cheering for. I'm here to embarrass my boys as much as I can.""
Fans screamed as the senior cheerleaders and football players were honored, walking with their families to the center of the field. The homecoming royalty rode around the track in vintage cars. A king and queen were crowned.
Chase and his girlfriend slipped into the stands, practically unnoticed, just after the national anthem. They took a seat by themselves at the far end of the bleachers.
But as the red team quarterback threw a touchdown pass for a come-from-behind victory, they sat next to friends. Chase clapped his good hand on the side of his leg, cheering.

647,"Publication: The Mirror, , Fairfield University, Fairfield, CTClub sports are back and are fully running this academic year as COVID-19 has become easier to navigate on campus. Like all other areas of campus, club sports have been significantly impacted with balancing state, university and league guidelines regarding COVID-19. Indoor sports are still facing some challenges due to the mask mandate still being in effect. Despite the health and pandemic side of things, funding surrounding club sports is yet another stressor for club sports post-pandemic.
Every year, each team completes a budget projection form with Assistant Director of Competitive Sports, Chelsey Wright. Once these forms are reviewed, the club team receives a grant necessary for them to play their season. Membership dues are required per athlete to make up for the remainder of their budget, fundraising and soliciting donations are highly encouraged. Wright spoke on the matter, stating “the majority of the funding is granted as an allocation from our Club Sports Operating Budget that is provided from the university to help fund our club sports.”
Senior Caroline Lanzillotta, the president of the club volleyball team, stated that “We were notified that we would no longer have the ‘roll over’ option, which would allow the dues we collected in past years to be used whenever.” When the athletic department made the decision to switch over to the “use it or lose it” system, each club team was incentivized to fundraise more to cover for the leftover expenses that the team may need.
Club sports funding is entirely dependent on the amount of athletes on each team and the various factors that are necessary to each sport. Some teams are in separate leagues and tournaments that require extended travel, overnight stays, referees, external facilities, and other payments. For example, the Fairfield University club ice hockey team has to use an ice rink off-campus where ice time is priced at $400 for a singular practice slot. Conversely, other teams fall under the category of “recreational,” meaning their budget mainly goes to equipment and internal facilities, and the other factors do not apply to them. 
The amount of fundraising and donations each team secures may allure to the divide and assumptions that each team is not funded fairly. The “outside funding” is put into a separate account specifically for each team, which is accessible for the team until used. The more funding each team solicits themselves will benefit in the sense that members on the team pay less out of their own pockets. Allocations are provided annually, so the fundraising and donations per team are considered a boost to their revenue. “We have opted for a Chipotle fundraiser and collected another round of dues this year, so we are looking like we are in a good place,” Lanzillotta said. 
Fairfield University strives to support the club sports program to the best of its ability. They work diligently to advocate for the teams and each of their individual successes across the board. In order to do that, they constantly evaluate and adjust their policies, procedures, and processes to meet every team’s individual needs.

649,"DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. – While Matanzas High School seniors were competing in their final sports games, taking finals, signing one another's yearbooks and closing out their school year, Principal Jeff Reaves was preparing his final farewell to every 2021 graduate.  From the beginning of March up until the morning of graduation at on June 2, Reaves scoured through transcripts, emails and his own memories to handwrite a personalized note to each of the 459 graduating seniors.  “I want to be positive for our students, especially in a time where there’s a lot of negativity and turmoil in the world,” Reaves said. “I wanted to shine some light on the students and encourage them as they begin their next journey in life.” Those notes were left on each graduate’s blue and black seat so they could read them before crossing the stage and receiving their diplomas.  “It was as much for me as them, and I got the chance to learn about each student individually,” Reaves said. “It’s easy to get caught up in the numbers, but it’s the names that really matter. I was doing my part to help them feel connected as a community and have their high school experience to be positive.” Senior photo shoot in strawberry fields: California graduate honors immigrant parents He thought he'd miss graduation: His Waffle House 'family' wouldn't let him. Culinary arts teacher Lisa Kittrell said that in her 15 years at Matanzas High School and 25 years in the education field, she has never seen a principal do anything this personal for the graduating seniors.  “When the little girl, who was sitting in my row at graduation, opened up her note and read it, she went ‘Wow, I can’t believe he did this and remembered this about me,’” Kittrell said. “It was just so touching that he did that for all of the graduates. It was just so touching.” Because of Reaves and the challenges the graduating class faced over the past year with online learning and new classroom rules as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Kittrell said, it was the most outstanding graduation she has experienced at Matanzas.  “It shows he really cares for the students,” she said. “It was just very exciting and very moving.” For each graduating class, Reaves said, he tries to work in something special based on the year. In the past he has done that through speeches, recognizing certain students during the graduation ceremony and through songs played at commencement.  In June 2020, when the pandemic kicked into high gear, Matanzas High School seniors graduated at Daytona International Speedway. The school also had customized yard signs made for each student that were placed on the football field and filmed by a drone. “It’s just to personalize their experience at high school,” Reaves said.  The response to Reaves’ personalized notes this year has been positive, and he said he feels humbled by the experience.  “It was an incredible class of students, and I was honored to serve them,” Reaves said. “In a sense they lost five quarters. The pandemic started when they were juniors and it impacted their entire senior year.” Schools are axing virtual learning: Some families want to stay online. Fall 2021 school year: Will schools and day cares require masks or COVID-19 vaccines in the fall?

650,"The coronavirus' summer surge is refilling Iowa hospitals, and doctors are bracing for the outbreak to worsen in coming weeks.
The Iowa Department of Public Health reported Thursday, August 5 that 214 COVID patients were hospitalized, up 36% from the 157 a week earlier and more than quadruple the 46 who were hospitalized on June 24.
The pandemic is rekindling as the highly transmissible delta variant spreads, especially among people who are unvaccinated, experts say. Iowa hospital leaders expect to see even more inpatients as the number of infections soars.
The resurgence comes as many people have stopped wearing face masks and taking other precautions, even if they are unprotected by coronavirus shots.
""And we're going to have a massive event coming up here with the State Fair, with people coming from out of state — including from Missouri, which we know is in the midst of a huge crisis,"" said Dr. Andrew Stefani, a hospitalist at Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines. ""We're not done with this surge. We're not close to done with this in Iowa.""
The fair, which starts Thursday, Aug. 12, is recommending but not requiring faces masks indoors for its hundreds of thousands of visitors. It also is not requiring vaccinations. Public health experts predict the event could amplify the COVID outbreak in Polk County, which already is listed by federal experts as having high transmission of the virus.
On top of that, other big entertainment events are being held, and Iowa kids will soon be returning to school, where they could spread the virus even if relatively few of them will become seriously ill from it.
""The writing is sort of on the wall,"" Stefani said of the continued risk of rising infections.
Stefani and two fellow physicians who work at Iowa Methodist met with the Des Moines Register Wednesday, August 4 to share their concerns about what the community faces.
Iowa's recent surge of COVID hospitalizations is still far below levels seen last fall, when more than 1,500 COVID patients packed into Iowa hospitals at a time. But the new spike comes at a time when many Iowa hospitals were already packed with other types of patients. They include people who have other infectious diseases, such as RSV, which are usually rare in summer, plus patients who are getting surgeries or other treatments they delayed because of the pandemic.
The Iowa Methodist physicians warned that the state's hospitals could again have to postpone nonemergency procedures if the COVID surge continues to spike, as happened last fall.
Patients no longer mostly elderly, chronically ill; 'Now, it's anybody'
Dr. Matt Trump, a lung specialist from the Iowa Clinic who works in Iowa Methodist's intensive care unit, said that early in the pandemic, most of his critically ill COVID patients were elderly people or those with severe chronic health conditions, such as obesity or diabetes.
That is no longer the case, he said.
""Now, it's anybody,"" Trump said.
He's seen young, unvaccinated adults with no previous health issues need to be put on ventilators recently because of COVID. Some have died.
Dr. Clint Hawthorne, medical director of Iowa Methodist Medical Center's emergency department, said even patients who don't become critically ill with COVID can face months or possibly years of debilitating after-effects. Those can include lung and heart damage, blood clots and loss of taste and smell. No one is sure yet what the lasting effects could be, including on children who become infected, he said.
Hawthorne said he wants people to understand that most of the severely ill patients now are people who have not received COVID shots.
""I hope that will get them over the finish line to get the vaccination,"" he said.
It's especially important to get the message out to younger people, who are less likely to have been vaccinated than seniors have been, Hawthorne said. Before the pandemic, older Americans had seen firsthand how vaccinations could block deadly diseases, such as polio. Younger Americans hadn't experienced that, he said.
""But here we are, at a moment in time where ... they can watch how vaccination has the potential to impact an entire country and an entire world,"" he said.
Just 25% of Iowans ages 12 through 15 and 39% of those 20 through 29 have been fully vaccinated, the Iowa Department of Public Health reported the week of August 2. That compares to 81% of Iowans 65 or older.
Doctors frustrated by
lack of trust in science
The three doctors said they are frustrated to know many Americans are avoiding vaccinations because they don't trust the advice of scientists and other medical experts.
Stefani said he and other doctors are willing to have honest discussions with patients about their concerns. But some patients are coming in primed with misinformation from other, less reliable sources.
""So many have their minds made up, and that's very frustrating and disheartening,"" he said. It would be as if a mechanic told him his car needs new brake pads, Stefani said. ""I don't say, 'No, no, no, you're wrong. I Googled it on the internet and all that needs to be done is you need to tighten this bolt.'""
Some skeptics point out that public health advice has changed, including on wearing face masks and the importance of sanitizing surfaces. But such shifts should be expected, as studies are done and physicians gain experience with the relatively new virus, the doctors said.
""That's what science is,"" Trump said. ""That's how it's done. Things are going to change.""
Stefani added: ""What we knew yesterday may be different than what we know today. And that doesn't make what we did yesterday wrong. It makes what we know today more precise.""

651,"Clemson's feel-good start to the baseball season continued Saturday with a 10-2 pounding of rival South Carolina at Segra Park in Columbia.
The Tigers, who had a rare losing season (25-27, 16-20 ACC) last year, are 10-0 and off to their best start since winning the first 13 games of 2002, when they made it to the College World Series.
Clemson has won both games in this best-of-three weekend, including 3-2 on Friday, to clinch the series victory for the sixth time in eight years. The Tigers went go for a sweep on Sunday at their home park of Doug Kingsmore Stadium.
Saturday's announced crowd of 9,020 is believed to be the largest ever in series history.
""There was a lot of orange and purple in the stands,"" Clemson coach Monte Lee said. ""Our fanbase came to support us here today, which was great to see.""
South Carolina (7-3) had a 2-1 eighth-inning lead on Friday but now has just 11 hits, two for extra bases, in the series. The Gamecocks are 1-for-14 with runners in scoring position.
""This is clearly a bump in our road for our season,"" South Carolina coach Mark Kingston said. ""But a marathon is 26 miles and some of the miles are not going to be real fun. Right now, we're in one of the miles that's not real fun, but we're going to learn about ourselves. We're going to dig deep and we're going to find ways to get better.""
South Carolina's pitching a mess
The Gamecocks' projected weekend rotation has been hit hard already by injuries.
Junior right-hander James Hicks pitched only seven innings before he was shut down for the rest of the season with an elbow injury. He will need Tommy John surgery, so there is doubt about whether he could even be ready for next season. He is a transfer from Crowder College, a JUCO school in Neosho, Missouri.
Junior left-hander Julian Bosnic is yet to take the mound this season because of a flexor strain in his pitching arm. Bosnic last season had four wins, four saves and a 2.84 ERA. Opponents hit only .133 against him and that includes .127 in the SEC. He made four starts and was being converted to do that full-time.
Saturday's emergency starter, junior right-hander Noah Hall, sailed through three innings but got only one more out and was charged with three runs. Sunday's starter is yet to be determined, but it will almost have to be a bullpen day with multiple relievers. Clemson will go with sophomore right-hander Nick Clayton, who has been hammered for 11 hits and six runs in his 5.2 innings.
Clemson has lineup spark at bottom
Bottom-of-the-order hitters are often considered second leadoff batters, but Benjamin Blackwell is making his case for the top.
Blackwell, a transfer shortstop from Dayton, was on base in all four plate appearances with three walks and a hit, two RBIs and a stolen base.

653,"It's just a guess, but I'm willing to bet the kit and caboodle that 
most Americans aren't shedding tears over President Joe Biden's ban 
on travelers from nations affected by COVID-19's latest variant.
You've got to hand it to the virus: Unlike most of its human 
incubators, COVID-19 knows what it's doing.
No matter how many defenses we concoct, or how many vaccines we 
invent, the virus adapts and reconfigures itself, each time 
improving its chances for survival.
This time, COVID-19's new omicron variant has hit southern Africa, 
where vaccines have been in short supply. Thus far, scientists 
worry that omicron is more transmissible than the delta variant.
As a result, several countries, including the United States, Japan, 
Israel, Canada, the members of the E.U. and possibly others are 
closing their borders to most travelers from eight countries: South 
Africa, Botswana, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique 
and Malawi. The list is likely to grow as the virus spreads and 
because it is possible, I hear, to fly somewhere else before 
catching a plane to the United States.
Some African leaders have called the travel bans an overreaction, 
but we have already tried underreacting. As I recall, that didn't 
go so well. The World Health Organization has warned against 
imposing travel restrictions and urged a ""risk-based and scientific 
approach"" -- whatever that means. South African Health Minister Joe 
Phaahla has said the restrictions are unjustified. How does he 
know? How does anyone know anything -- yet? They don't, and that's 
the point. Hence the travel bans.
The relative risk of widespread infection from travelers may be 
statistically insignificant, but why take a chance? If you ask 
whether my conscience is burdened by the ban's effect on a relative 
few, my honest answer may put un-woke readers in mind of ""Gone With 
The Wind's"" Rhett Butler. Or, perhaps, Woodstock's Country Joe and 
The Fish.
I'm dating myself, I realize, so I will spell it out: I don't give 
a damn.
Barring the economic collapse of any of these eight countries, due 
to short-term travel restrictions, isn't it merely sensible to try 
to stem dissemination of the variant for a few weeks until we know 
more about its transmissibility and the effectiveness of existing 
vaccines?
Yes. Of course. Biden has called the U.S. ban a ""precautionary 
measure"" until we know more. Meanwhile, scientists will be 
mimicking bartenders by shaking and then testing vials filled with 
a mixture of vaccinated human blood and the omicron variant, as CNN 
medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta has explained the process.
It's possible that some people will miss spending the holiday 
season with loved ones -- just as it's possible that we here at 
home will face the return of unpleasant restrictions that we have 
only recently believed were safely behind us.
But neither represents the end of life as we know it. They are 
disappointments. I sympathize with Ruth Daines-Slack, who told the 
BBC she was planning to travel from Cape Town to the United Kingdom 
for Christmas and her mom's 100th birthday celebration. But a woman 
who has made it to 100 knows something about disappointment and a 
good long visit on Skype may have to do until the ban is lifted.
Apologies for the cynicism, but we humans have become so spoiled 
and entitled, we can hardly suffer a slow Uber driver, a long line 
at the grocery or bank, a shortage of nearly anything, or the 
slightest disruptions in our cherished routines. Missing a flight 
can seem like the end of the world.
But once more -- and probably not for the last time -- we all need 
to take steps to limit the spread of a deadly disease for just a 
while.
One country, Japan, offers a compelling model. Japan is a vibrant, 
friendly, high-functioning country, which is why so many travelers 
want to go there. Japan knows how to do stuff.
Like shut their borders. They have closed their doors to virtually 
everyone for a month.
As of 2019, about 76,000 Americans were living in Japan and I'm a 
bit surprised that number isn't higher. We seem to be attracted to 
the pristine and the competent, even if we can't duplicate it 
ourselves. There's a reason for this: Japan doesn't put up with 
anybody's nonsense. Stay home, says Japan, we don't care if your 
feelings are hurt.
It's apparently not in our DNA to delay gratification, but the 
world would benefit immeasurably by cultivating patience and a 
culture of grit. In the meantime, we should aspire to be more like 
Japan and the virus. Both adapt to reality for maximum survival -- 
and both know what they're doing.

656,"Although we're closer than ever to resuming life as usual in the United States, globally, the end of the pandemic is horrifyingly far away. India is now the epicenter of the worst ongoing coronavirus outbreak, and the situation there could get worse before it begins to get better.
Despite hope in the United States, where the situation is likely to be much better by summer and at the new normal in the fall, we can't be blinded by the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. India's surge is a reminder that the virus is learning and adapting to us faster than we are learning and adapting to it. The pandemic is more severe than ever and, fueled by variants, is an ongoing and increasing risk. If we get our response right, we can save more than a million lives in the coming year.
Dazzling scientific progress resulted in rapid development of Covid vaccines that are more effective than many experts dared to hope. But although Israel, the UK, and, soon, the US will enter a new reality with the virus largely tamed by vaccines, global vaccination lags badly. Even in the best of circumstances, vaccines will take months to control the virus. And we are far from the best of circumstances.
Globally, vaccines would not crush the curve in the short-term even if there were enough of them -- which there aren't. There is still not enough vaccine in most countries, and low-income countries in particular lack sufficient vaccine. The virus and its variants are gathering strength and speed. Global cooperation is essential if we are to win our continuing war against Covid.
It takes weeks to months to roll out vaccines and get them into enough people's arms to make a difference. It then takes several more weeks before protection fully kicks in. Vaccines don't help people if they already have active Covid infection and probably don't help much if received after exposure to the virus. This is why we need to continue protecting people until they are vaccinated.
The pandemic is the world's most important problem. We should act accordingly. Our vaccine infrastructure cannot be relied on to meet the world's needs. Even if there were enough vaccines right now, which there aren't, they might slow but would not stop spread of the virus. Countries with excess supply can make a dent, but vaccine production needs to accelerate tremendously to meet need. Until much more vaccine is available, continued masking and distancing and reduced traveling are all essential.
Rosy estimates that there will be enough vaccines in 2021 are encouraging, but companies missed their 2020 production projections by 96%, and overall production is still only at a quarter of projected need for 2021. Variants which could overwhelm some vaccines, the possible need for booster doses, safety signals, and production delays are all very real risks. We can't bet lives and global recovery on uncertain vaccines and uncertain production.
All types of vaccines that are proven to be effective need to be scaled up as rapidly as possible. The Novavax, J&J, AstraZeneca, and other vaccines are all important, but mRNA vaccines are the most promising. They are quicker to scale up and are likely safer and more effective. Transporting and handling them is getting easier, as problems maintaining required supercold temperatures are being addressed.
mRNA vaccines are our best hope for an end to the pandemic -- our insurance policy against variants, the possible need for boosters, and production delays with other vaccines -- but current capacity is nowhere near the need. Transferring technology and stepping up production globally, especially of mRNA vaccines, is the most important step the Biden administration can take to help end the Covid pandemic. US taxpayers funded the Moderna vaccine. Not sharing this technology puts us at risk if even more dangerous variants emerge.
Regional mRNA manufacturing hubs are crucial to provide the best vaccines on a global scale. Doing so will take longer than we wish, which is why we must start right now. India, South Korea, Singapore, Brazil and other countries in Latin America, South Africa, Senegal, and Rwanda all have the potential to establish vaccine manufacturing capacity and could become providers of vaccines globally. The CureVac mRNA vaccine candidate, now in Phase 3 clinical trials, might be another resource for expanding production.
The dangerous B.1.1.7 variant continues its stunning march across the US, and now accounts for more than half of new cases that have been sequenced in this country. Even with more than half of our adult population fully vaccinated, we face continued risk of outbreaks, and those who remain unvaccinated -- including young people -- face the risk of infection with a deadlier virus.
During the 1918 pandemic, in many places, the second wave was deadlier than the first. I'm concerned that, globally, we're now at the most dangerous phase of this pandemic yet. Covid is becoming deadlier and more transmissible, the virus is circulating at higher levels in more places, and after more than a year of having our lives disrupted there's increasing human fatigue.
Globally, 1.8 million deaths were reported from Covid in 2020. At the current rate, the number of deaths will be even higher in 2021. But this isn't inevitable; pandemics aren't natural disasters. We've shown that we can control Covid. Variants remain the biggest wild card, but we've learned a lot about the virus and how to limit its impact.
Protection measures work, and effective action can save at least a million lives this year. We must take these six steps now to deal with explosive spread globally.
1. Protect health care and health care workers.
2. Mask up.
3. Maintain distancing to avoid superspreading.
4. Continue essential services, including school.
5. Vaccinate, especially health care workers and older people.
6. Learn and adapt.
For each of these six, we need a focused, well-managed, accountable approach. We MUST do better protecting health care and health care workers. Doing so will save lives from Covid as well as from other diseases that become deadlier when care is disrupted. Controlling Covid will save lives from Covid and from many other diseases.
It's possible to beat infectious diseases. These stories of success of how we prevented epidemics in the past give me hope. If we work together across borders to fight Covid and invest in preparedness, we can save millions of lives. Covid has shown the costs of failure, but a safer and healthier future is possible. It's up to us to make that happen.

As the Salt Lake Valley continues its booming growth, what are your solutions for affordable housing, preserving community character and creating a high quality of life for city residents?
High quality of life for West Valley City residents is akin to the phrase “pursuit of happiness” in the Declaration of Independence. It means different things to different people. To some, it means big houses with manicured lawns and gardens. To others, it means close access to public transit, shopping and entertainment. Others value parks, trails and open spaces. The key for the city is to support and promote variety so that people from all backgrounds and in all walks of life can find their own comfortable corner of the city. Although the cost of housing is market driven, the city can and should provide planning, quality standards and variety. Whether one lives in an apartment building, planned community or a neighborhood of single-family houses, what makes it home is being safe and comfortable in one’s surroundings. Above all, quality of life depends on confidence that you live in a safe place. That you have good neighbors. That you have adequate public safety resources to respond to emergencies. That is job one of city government.
Besides affordable housing, what are the two biggest challenges facing the city in the next four years, and what are some specific programs or policy changes you will introduce to solve them?
The two things I hear the most about are public safety and infrastructure. The hiring pool of good quality men and women wanting to serve as police officers and firefighters has been shrinking even as the population-driven need for the same has been rising. West Valley City must be competitive in salary, benefits, training and equipment to attract the best police officers and firefighters. We don’t just want to fill positions, we want to hire career-minded public servants whose heart is in the work and are the very best trained and qualified to provide the very best service to our residents. One challenge the city has and will always have is transportation. Although the city has three major highways running through it from the north to the south, it can be challenging to travel east and west because of the few major east-west roads we have. It is imperative to invest in the roads we have and to better take advantage of opportunities for public transit and alternative transportation.
What are your ideas for investing federal pandemic aid in the city, including funds left over from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act as well as funds from the American Rescue Plan Act?
Federal funding should never be considered as a windfall or free money. Whatever the program, it is always our tax dollars being returned to us to be spent appropriately and judiciously. Those federal funds should be spent on emergency preparedness so that we are better equipped, trained and coordinated to handle future crises.
What is a fun or unique fact about you?
I am not special in any way. I think that makes me unique.

Occupation: Co-owner of Oakbridge Greenhouse and District 3 City Council member.
As the Salt Lake Valley continues its booming growth, what are your solutions for affordable housing, preserving community character and creating a high quality of life for city residents?
Through alignment of zoning, we have allowed for categories from affordable housing to large single-family dwellings. Through this alignment of zoning, taxes and subsidies, we have opened our city to every level of homebuyer. West Valley City is a large city that is fortunate to still offer a hometown feel. Our residents are often lifelong residents who enjoy a sense of community. Our residents look out for one another and work to have the best available to their neighbors. Just this year, many neighborhood celebrations have taken place offering communities an opportunity to celebrate together after a long hard year.
Besides affordable housing, what are the two biggest challenges facing the city in the next four years, and what are some specific programs or policy changes you will introduce to solve them?
As with any city of similar size, West Valley City faces many challenges. One of the issues is our lack of developable property. We will have to efficiently develop our remaining land assets, and make sure any development we authorize aligns with the city’s 50-year plan, and the best option for the residents. One of the things I feel that we as a council/mayor team do well is address issues when they arise and work hard together to solve the problems before they become major issues.
What are your ideas for investing federal pandemic aid in the city, including funds left over from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act as well as funds from the American Rescue Plan Act?
Our city is economically solvent and keeps a balanced budget. Any funds available to be distributed through federal funding would be used to better our city for our residents. Funding for Emergency preparedness and restoration of struggling businesses affected by the pandemic are a couple of the areas I feel funding could be spent.
What is a fun or unique fact about you?
I am the proud owner of a much-pampered 1969 Mustang convertible.

663,"Right when the actor thought he'd done almost everything, Ken Burns offered him the role of Benjamin Franklin, and, just maybe, held off an early retirement.Mandy Patinkin arrived so long ago in his career -- winning a Tony Award for ""Evita"" and an Emmy for ""Chicago Hope"" and being the object of adoration and imitation as Inigo Montoya in ""The Princess Bride"" -- that he likes to jest he's getting ready to leave.""I keep seeing the exit door,"" Patinkin, 69, said jovially on a video call from his cabin in the Hudson Valley in New York.In fact, he toyed with retiring after ""Homeland"" ended in 2020 but discovered during the pandemic that he missed the structure, the learning and even the anxiety of acting.Around that time, Ken Burns came knocking.Burns wanted Patinkin's sonorous voice for ""Benjamin Franklin,"" his two-part dissection of the multifaceted, often contradictory founding father: a writer and publisher, a scientist and an inventor, a diplomat and signer of both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution, a slave owner and, later in life, an abolitionist.""And, all of a sudden, I'm sitting in front of a microphone with some of the world's greatest historians guiding me through how to speak a language that was somewhat older and from the queen's England at times,"" Patinkin said. When he finally saw the four-hour documentary (premiering on April 4 and 5 on PBS), he was stunned by what he thought he knew about Franklin and didn't.""I couldn't get over that I got to be this guy,"" he said. ""Talk about parts you get to play.""But singing is his first love. And after being stranded without an accompanist during the pandemic, Patinkin -- who hears music even in the mundane and can transform a classic into something wondrously unfamiliar -- is back to working three hours a day with the pianist Adam Ben-David in preparation for a new concert tour beginning May 25 in Baltimore.""I've never been happier,"" Patinkin said.In the meantime, he and his wife, the Obie-winning actress and writer Kathryn Grody, keep their creativity alive and their opinions heard through wildly popular social media videos masterminded by their son Gideon.""We have this crazy platform,"" Patinkin said, ""and he realizes what a gift it is to have a voice like this.""Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.1. His new grandson I was in tears last night. I've got this grandchild in my arms, and I couldn't believe this family was together after all this time, at this moment in our history, with this new life. In the midst of such cuckoo-ness, my son, Isaac, and daughter-in-law, Lennon, had the courage to bring a child into this world. I can't imagine something more hopeful.2. Praying with his dog, Becky With the pandemic and all the healing that needs to be done, I thought, ""I've got to feed this dog twice a day. I'll say the healing prayer for the whole world."" So I do three Jewish prayers: the Shema first; then the ""Mi Shebeirach,"" which my dear friend Debbie Friedman made the popular version of for the reform Jewish community; then the blessing over breaking bread. And she knows to sit there. She knows each melody, and she knows when it's getting close. Then I say, ""OK,"" and she goes to her bowl.3. Live performance Work-wise, my favorite thing to do is to sing music in concert for people all over the world. I finished a 30-city concert tour the week before the pandemic hit. Then, all of a sudden, we're locked up. My piano player, Adam Ben-David, and I started working again about two, three weeks ago.It's interesting. The concert I put together, called ""Diaries,"" [reflected] what was going on in our country, with the election and the polarization. Friends would come and went, ""Wow, we loved what you had to say, but that's pretty dark."" So we changed. I went over hundreds of [more upbeat] songs, and I said to Adam, ""Let's put all these songs back in our bones and our bodies and work them together because I need happier stuff."" And that's what we've been doing -- welcoming us back to being alive with the music.4. International Rescue Committee They are trying to take myself and my wife and my son Gideon to the Ukraine-Polish border as ambassadors from the I.R.C. to bring attention where attention must be paid. Our initial question was, ""What is the Covid situation in Poland?"" And then you think of the optics. We've been vaccinated and boosted. Essentially what's there now, you're well-protected and you won't die from it. And I thought, ""I'm going to wear a mask next to these women and children who have been fleeing for their lives? I'm going to keep a distance from these people when they need to be held and near humanity who cares?"" And I finally came, ""No. I'll take my chances because they need people that pay attention. I'm finished being afraid.""5. National Dance Institute We have a place in the country that we love. One day, I believe my son Isaac was 3 or 4, this car drives up and this guy gets out and he comes running down the mountain, and he goes, ""Hello, hello, hello! I want to meet Isaac!"" And this is Jacques d'Amboise, the true Pied Piper of the world. He grabs Isaac and he says, ""You're going to be a dancer!"" We don't know what he's talking about. Then Isaac became part of the Tiny Tots [renamed the First Team in 2004], and we became part of Jacques's life.6. ""Benjamin Franklin"" by Walter Isaacson and ""John Adams"" by David McCullough I started reading the Isaacson book again, and I couldn't get over how much I missed the first time I read it. These guys are just phenomenal history teachers. You know, as you read any book, it's mentioning all kinds of other books along the way. Isaacson is constantly nodding the head toward McCullough. So I'm three-quarters of the way through McCullough's book, which I've tried to read countless times in the past. And because of this experience, I'm sailing through it.7. ""C'mon C'mon"" from the director Mike Mills I'm a member of the Academy, so we watch everything, and my favorite movie was ""C'mon C'mon"" with Joaquin Phoenix. That movie is so great. There's a kid [Woody Norman] in it who's just off-the-charts brilliant. And Joaquin is, bar none, my favorite actor of this time. Period. There's a lot of great ones out there, so that's saying something because this man is the gift to the arts, and this is one of his most beautiful performances. Run to see it.8. ""Lucy and Desi"" from Amy Poehler I couldn't get over what a gorgeous job she did telling that love story -- the influence they had on the whole industry, but, really, on the human heart. I got to meet Lucy when I was doing ""Evita"" in 1979 at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles. There's a knock on my dressing room door after a performance, and I hear this voice [Patinkin mimics in gibberish a gravelly baritone voice], and I go, ""That's my Aunt Ethel!"" And then this woman comes in, and my Aunt Ethel had red hair. So she walks into my dressing room like a bulldozer, talking in that voice. And I go, ""Aunt Ethel!"" I even think I said, ""How's Uncle Joe?"" And at some point it hits me, ""Oh my God, you're not Aunt Ethel. You're Lucy!""9. Toy trains My father came home when I was 8 years old, and he bought me, supposedly -- me, spelled himself -- a Lionel toy train, an engine of which I still have. To this day, it runs perfectly, with almost no maintenance whatsoever. Over the years, I built layouts in my basement on a 4-by-8-foot sheet of plywood. Then we got this place in the country and there was an old barn, and we took the upstairs and made it a train room. We slowly built this wonderful layout. My kids were not interested when they were younger, but for Hanukkah or my birthday, they would give an hour in the train room with Dad. That would be their gift to me.10. Quiet The thing I love most these days is quiet and being with my wife, doing nothing and just having her nearby. It's my greatest pleasure after 44 years of two people that spend some time loving each other and some time killing each other that, after all this time, we can gaze into the face of our grandchild and do it together. That we have each other, and we've stuck it out through all the troubles.(PHOTOGRAPH BY Monica Schipper/Getty Images FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES)",Mandy Patinkin Says His Prayers
665,"A startling statistic emerged as advisers to the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday debated use of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine in children ages 5 to 11. According to one federal scientist, by June an estimated 42% of these children had already been infected with the coronavirus.
That figure was much higher than anyone expected. But the estimate, which was from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, might have overstated the percentage of children who were infected, several experts said. Among other flaws, the percentage was based on tests known to have a high rate of “false positives” — signaling the presence of antibodies where there are none.
And even if unexpectedly high numbers of children have been infected, parents should not assume that they are shielded from the virus and don’t need the vaccine. Immunization will cement that protection now and against future virus variants, said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania.
“The data are clear that even if they had been exposed in the past that they would benefit from the vaccine,” he said, speaking of children. “The risks of vaccination are very low, whereas the benefits are appreciable.”
Are 42% of younger children really immune to the coronavirus?
Most likely, no. The CDC estimate was based on tests of a small number of children who had blood drawn for routine medical care or other illnesses. That is not a representative sample of the general population, said Akiko Iwasaki, an immunologist at Yale University.
For example, the sample may have included children who have cancer or other conditions that weaken the immune system. “Usually, kids don’t get blood drawn for any routine medical care unless they have some reason to,” Iwasaki said.
Studies based on blood samples at clinics or by recruiting volunteers notoriously overestimate how many people have been infected, said Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.
“If you’re not careful about doing a random sample, then the seroprevalence numbers can get pretty wacky,” he said.
For example, scientists examining blood donations estimated that about 76% of the population in Manaus, Brazil, had been exposed to the virus by October 2020, perhaps achieving herd immunity. That presumption turned out to be horribly wrong: Most of Brazil, including Manaus, saw a long and deadly wave of infections this year, which claimed more than 4,000 lives per day at its peak.
The ideal way to estimate “seroprevalence” — the percentage of people with antibodies to the virus — is to randomly sample households, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. And persuading large numbers of families to have blood drawn from healthy children is likely to be a losing proposition.
In America, the percentage of children infected is likely to be lower than the CDC’s estimate, because many of them were at home during the big surges, Bhattacharya said. The 42% figure “doesn’t pass the smell test.”
I think my child had COVID. Can I find out before saying yes to the vaccine?
If you don’t already have evidence of your child’s infection — for example, the result from a PCR test — there is no reliable way to confirm it now. COVID-19 symptoms closely resemble those of other respiratory illnesses.
“It will be difficult to ascertain who had infection and who did not,” Iwasaki said.
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
And testing for antibodies after the fact is fraught. Apart from the possibility of false positives, the tests may not detect antibodies in children. Many never become visibly ill, and several studies suggest that people who are asymptomatic or have only mild symptoms produce far fewer antibodies than those who are severely ill.
“It’s not clear to me that the serological tests can be used to faithfully identify people who have had exposures before,” Hensley said. “I don’t think we’re at that point now.”
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
I know my child had COVID. Does she still need the vaccine?
Skipping vaccination would be a gamble, experts said. There are many unanswered questions about the strength and durability of immunity in children.
“There are too many unknowns on that, whereas the vaccine is known — that’s my caution,” said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco. “Certainly, I wouldn’t put all my eggs into the previous infection, natural immunity basket.”
As with the protection conferred by vaccines, immunity from natural infection may weaken over time, leaving children susceptible to reinfection. “I’d be interested to know when that infection was,” Chin-Hong said. “If it was a year or so ago, then I would worry about waning immunity.”
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
In adults, natural immunity generally “seems to be holding up well,” Bhattacharya said.
But it’s unclear whether the protection seen in adults extends to children, in part because most children tend to have milder symptoms than adults and may not have mounted a full-throttled defense against the virus.
Natural immunity in children also may not hold up against variants. Several studies have shown that just one dose of the vaccine in a previously infected adult can turbocharge protection, even against variants such as beta and delta.
“I suspect that will be the case with kids, as well,” Hensley said.
(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
Vaccination should also lower the chances of a reinfected child passing the virus to others who may be susceptible to severe illness. “If someone in your household is extremely vulnerable, then the consequences of that are pretty bad,” Bhattacharya said.
I’m worried about side effects. Is the vaccine safe?
All of the evidence so far indicates that the vaccines are far safer than a bout of COVID-19, even for children.
For example, although the vaccines have been associated with the rare chance of myocarditis, inflammation of the heart, in young men, the symptoms have quickly resolved in most of them. COVID-19 is much more likely to cause myocarditis, and a much more severe version.
“At the end of the day, acquiring immunity through infection is risky business,” Hensley said.
Over the course of the pandemic, more than 8,300 children ages 5 to 11 have been hospitalized, and roughly one-third of them were admitted to intensive care units, the FDA advisers were told. At least 94 children in this age group have died. Some continue to have symptoms weeks to months after the infection has resolved.
Federal agencies are continuing to collect safety information about the vaccines, Hensley noted, and will pick up any serious side effects that surface.
For children who have a history of heart disease or do not respond to the vaccine because of certain medical conditions, there may be another option. Some companies are developing long-lasting antibody drugs that can significantly cut the risk of infection.
AstraZeneca’s antibody cocktail could protect recipients for up to a year, Chin-Hong noted. “That’s the wave of the future.”

667,"MILWAUKEE - It was opening night Tuesday for the NBA.
Already.
And it was momentous in Milwaukee, the city showing off with its  breezy, warm welcome back. As the title banner was unfurled in royal fashion at Fiserv Forum, we were temporarily blinded by the bling of the saucer-sized championship rings. It was gloriously gaudy for about 10 whole minutes.
And then, reality set in. The Milwaukee Bucks took their first step back up the mountain that is the 2021-22 NBA regular season.
Thanks to the unusual  scheduling  of last season due to the coronavirus pandemic, and the Bucks' march all the way to a Game 6 victory in the Finals against Phoenix, this was the shortest NBA offseason.
Tuesday night went unspoiled as the Bucks dominated the Brooklyn Nets, but veteran Khris Middleton even admitted that he got a little bit tired for a second there at the end in the fourth quarter. They all did. First games are rough. And it's only Oct. 19. It's just Game 1 of 82.
More than 90 minutes after the game Middleton headed out of the arena and he said doesn't want to know about things like cortisol and the fight-or-flight stress hormone levels, or the medical jargon around being in constant survival mode as an elite athlete enduring a long basketball season.
All he knows is he never really got a break. For a year now, his life has been orbiting around the basketball, in winter, spring, summer and fall.
And the 30-year-old knows he is going to monitor his strength and energy this year based on what he learned from the grind last year.
""I just know what I feel,"" he said. ""I drive the medical staff crazy from time to time because I don't like taking extra things; I'm not big into medicine. Or testing. I just go by what I feel.""
Here's just one opinion: Managing the physical and mental health and rest in harmony with the pursuit of playing competitive games and practices will be the biggest test all year for the Bucks. And probably one of the most revisited topics of discussion from now until April.
And a reason the NBA should have canceled  preseason games for 2021.
Given all that occurred last season with the schedule condensed into a sometimes play-every-other-night format, it was an unreal grind.
Granted, it was impressive that the NBA held two nearly complete back-to-back seasons during the coronavirus pandemic, first in the Orlando bubble and then in the delayed 2020-21 season. Cheers to everyone in the NBA for doing it. But it was exhausting.
It made this NBA preseason seem more extraneous than usual, even with the new faces on Milwaukee's roster. Those five games have already been forgotten.
I would argue the NBA (and NFL too) should cancel all preseason games  evermore. Or limit it to one dress rehearsal.
These leagues have become year-round ventures. Players only give themselves a couple of weeks off after the season ends. And then they get right back to work drilling and conditioning. They train. They show up in shape. Coaches and general managers know exactly who they're keeping  and who the camp bodies are.
And the season is long enough to gently ease back any recovering veterans from injury. Shaking off the rust, developing new talent, tinkering with rosters and changing lineups can be worked out in the first month of the regular season. In fact, that could make the first month as interesting and meaningful as the last.
But we keep doing things the way they've always been done, at the risk of wearing down the best in the game. The bet here is that will present a real challenge for the 2021 NBA defending champs.
The offseason was only 69 days for the Bucks.
And only about 53 days for summer Olympians Middleton and Jrue Holiday.
Even with 10 fewer regular season games in a 72-game season last year, Middleton played 2,500 minutes and Holiday added 2,150. Giannis Antetokounmpo played 2,250. These numbers all include playoff minutes.
And now Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer will have to decide how much to play his highest-paid, marquee Big Three.
He should consider resting them. Every minute he can. He's always appeared to be progressive in this category, maybe intuitive to his team's needs. General fatigue is obvious when you're looking for signs of it: no one is talking or joking around, when everyone is silent, the body language looks less and less like the ""warrior pose"" and more like video gamer. Not to mention the on-court signals: shots consistently fall short, players reach on defense and stop moving their feet and noncontact injuries pile up.
Budenholzer said energy management is something he and his staff have been discussing since training camp began Sept. 28.
""It's a constant conversation, it's a constant dialogue,"" said Budenholzer. ""How it  translates to how much they play in games can vary, but keeping our guys healthy, that's really a constant conversation that never stops. Feedback from the players is good too, and their trust, their belief in the sports performance team and everything we do is high level.""
We have 124 days until the all-star break and 175 days until the play-in games for the NBA playoffs.
The Bucks have plenty of time to strategize. How to balance competitiveness and rest. How to conserve energy with controlling emotions. How to put aside distractions.
For Middleton, his favorite ways of coping are getting extra treatment and taking more time to stretch. Tedious but simple work that he knows will help him endure.
Or tinkering around with how many  shots to take in practice.
""You just have a feeling for it,"" said Middleton. ""When you find that sweet spot, with your body and your jump shot, you don't want to overdo it so you don't overthink it. You find that rhythm where everything feels smooth.""
This won't be the last time this will be discussed.
The Bucks will have to try new things and adapt to new ideas. There's no rest for the weary champs. While they manage a few new faces, and maybe new pressures of being in the spotlight, the greatest task of all will be how to get a full season out of a battery that didn't have time to fully recharge.

672,"Southwest Florida's largest hospital operators have run out or are waiting on their first shipments of a type of monoclonal antibody treatment considered to be the most effective against the omicron variant of COVID-19 now quickly spreading throughout Florida.
Sotrovimab is in short supply nationally. Texas announced Monday it was out of the treatment until January.
Administrators at Lee County-based Lee Health, the largest hospital operator between Tampa and Miami, announced Wednesday that its limited supply had run out.
NCH Healthcare System, which operates the largest hospitals in Collier County, is waiting on its first shipment of sotrovimab, spokesman Shawn McConnell said Wednesday. ""We have not been informed yet as to how many doses we will be receiving or when.""
Physicians Regional Healthcare System, which operates two hospitals in Naples, did not immediately respond to a request for information about its own supply.
Sotrovimab is distributed by the federal government to the Florida Department of Health, which allocates doses throughout the state.
""The timing of receiving an additional supply of Sotrovimab is uncertain,"" Lee Health spokeswoman Mary Briggs said in an emailed announcement to local media. ""It is more important than ever to get vaccinated or get a booster shot so to protect yourself against COVID-19 during the current Omicron surge.""
The Florida Department of Health, which has made the availability of monoclonal antibody treatments a centerpiece of its effort to combat COVID-19, did not respond to inquiries about the shortage.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last announced a shipment of 55,000 doses nationally on Dec. 17, including 1,050 doses that were allocated for Florida.
""Please note that the federal government's current supply of sotrovimab is extremely limited, and additional doses of the product will not be available until the week of January 3rd,"" the announcement added.
Other monoclonal antibodies have been effective against previous variants, but not omicron, according to Lee Health, which has been operating three monoclonal antibody infusion centers in outpatient settings to treat COVID-19 for more than a year.
GlaxoSmithKline, which makes sotrovimab along with Vir Biotechnology, is ""working with urgency and exploring options to expand our supply capacity,"" according to spokesperson Kathleen Quinn.
In June, the companies showed that sotrovimab reduced by 79% the risk of requiring hospitalization for more than a day or dying from any cause within a month compared to placebo.
The government has spent $1 billion buying doses of sotrovimab to provide at no cost to people who need it. Like other monoclonals, it is expected to run about $2,100 per treatment course.
Like most of the monoclonal antibodies, sotrovimab is given through a 30-minute infusion, which has been difficult to deliver during the pandemic because it requires dedicated facilities where highly infectious COVID-19 patients can be kept away from others.

675,"
Nick Sirianni, hired in January to be the new head coach of the Philadelphia Eagles, will get at least three seasons to get his new team back on track, based on owner Jeffrey Lurie's hiring and firing history.
The same cannot be said of many of his players, including some at the top of the depth chart who may be headed for their final season in Philadelphia or may have even played their last games as Eagles already.
Here are five Eagles facing the most crucial phases of their careers. How they perform could go a long way toward determining the team's success this coming season as well.
5. WR JJ Arcega-Whiteside
After drafting Whiteside in the second round in 2019, the Eagles used first-round picks in 2020 and 2021 on wide receivers Jalen Reagor and DeVonta Smith, respectively. That doesn't bode well for Arcega-Whiteside, who probably will have to be spectacular in training camp just to earn a spot as the fifth or sixth option.
The former Stanford Cardinal just has not been able to make the transition to the NFL, catching just 10 of 22 targets in 16 games as a rookie and just four of eight targets last season, when he was inactive for five 
games due to nagging injuries and missed two more while on the COVID-19 list.
But as far as receivers coach Aaron Moorehead is concerned, 2020 didn't really count.
""He just caught the injury bug,"" the coach said after OTAs. ""... JJ would be the first one to tell you that last year was not good, but JJ is in a great place right now, playing good ball. He had a good three weeks here with us. Excited to see where JJ can put himself this year.""
4. T Jordan Mailata
The giant Australian performed well last season when pressed into service as a starter, but he will battle 2019 first-round pick Andre Dillard for the open left tackle spot. And if he loses, it would be hard to imagine him re-signing with the team when his rookie contract expires at the end of the 2021 season.
Dillard, on the other hand, has two seasons plus an option year remaining on his contract, so he has more time.
Still, left tackle is a big-money position, so only one is going to get a second contract. Or maybe none if the Eagles don't like what they see from either one.
3. K Jake Elliott
In 2020, Elliott was not as automatic as he used to be, which could be a red flag for someone so young (26).
The Eagles certainly are hoping they won't have to move on from him because of all the clutch kicks he's made over just four seasons, including his rookie year, when they won the Super Bowl.
But if they can't get him to be more dependable on short-range kicks, they'll have to consider a change. Elliott made just one of three field-goal attempts from inside 30 yards and missed two extra points last year.
There are worse in this league. Much worse. But there are better too.
Hopefully new special teams quality control coach Tyler Brown can help. He has a good reputation working with kickers. Having a specific kicking coach rather than just a special teams coordinator could be just what Elliott needs and is a growing trend in the NFL.
2. DE Derek Barnett
Barnett is sort of like Russia used to be (and for the most part still is): A riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma.
On the one hand, he has a great motor, undeniable talent and the ultimate ability to affect the quarterback. On the other, he has more career penalties (20) than sacks (19.5), so he heads into the fifth and final year of his contract looking for a big payday that he may not get from the Eagles.
Barnett will need to cut down on his penalties for that to happen, and he has the extra motivation of know it's now or never.
The Eagles sure stand to benefit too.
1. CB Darius Slay
Darius Slay? Seriously? Didn't the Eagles just pay him like $30 million after trading for him last year?
Yes, yes and yes.
But Slay was a disaster when left alone on islands with the league's top receivers he was charged with guarding last year. And at age 30 he's not getting any younger.
Look at his contract, too.
The Eagles can get $14.5 million in salary cap relief by moving on from him before next season, according to overthecap.com
That's not small potatoes, and if the Eagles switch to mostly zone coverage calls, they won't necessarily need any high-priced, lockdown players at that position.
Suffice to say that 2021 could be the final season for Slay in Philadelphia, even if he plays well.

677,"Publication: Daily Bruin, , University of California - Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CAThis Week in the News serves as The Quad’s space for reflection on current events at and around UCLA. Every week, Daily Bruin staffers will analyze some of the most significant stories to keep readers up to speed.
As students ride through week three eager for an update on the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, UCLA Health is administering a new COVID-19 treatment while witnessing nurse-led protests. Meanwhile, UCLA sports encountered big news – the Pac-12 conference parted ways with Commissioner Larry Scott and UCLA gymnastics returns Saturday with Kyla Ross making her assistant coaching debut.
UCLA nurses protest possible increase in number of patients per nurse in hospitals
UCLA nurses are protesting against a waiver that aims to increases the nurse-to-patient ratio in health care centers.
Before the pandemic, California state law mandated hospitals cap the nurse-to-patient ratio at one intensive care unit nurse to two patients. However, the California Department of Public Health has newly offered hospitals a waiver which would allow them to assign one nurse to three patients in the ICU.
UCLA Health’s waiver application was approved Dec. 11, but the waiver has not gone into effect yet.
California Nurses Association labor representative Benjamin Elliott said UCLA nurses plan to safely protest the waiver by holding press conferences and sending mass letters to administrators until their concerns have been met.
Marcia Santini, a registered nurse at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, said UCLA Health administrators should rescind the waiver application and instead ensure facilities are properly staffed.
UCLA Health spokesperson Phil Hampton said in an emailed statement that support staff have been added as needed, and staff have cross-trained in multiple specialties over the past few months.
Student leaders voice questions, expectations regarding UCLA‘s vaccination plans
Though UCLA announced Thursday its plan to vaccinate faculty and staff who work on campus and those who are over the age of 65 as early as February, the university is yet to release a timeline on student vaccinations.
Student Health Advisory Committee chair Akash Kapoor said the Arthur Ashe Student Health and Wellness Center expects students will be vaccinated before the upcoming fall quarter.
Some student leaders have been vocal on UCLA’s role in distributing the COVID-19 vaccine. Audrey Price, co-president of Bruins Public Health, said UCLA should provide resources for students to educate themselves on the vaccine. Price added that the vaccine should be a part of UCLA’s immunization requirements.
Peter Katona, the chairperson of UCLA’s Infection Control Working Group, said religious exemptions and questions about the vaccine’s effectiveness could block a mandatory vaccine policy.
It is unclear if UCLA plans to make the vaccine mandatory.
UCLA Health administers monoclonal antibody treatments to COVID-19 patients
UCLA Health has begun to distribute monoclonal antibody treatments to patients in the early stages of COVID-19 infection.
Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Eli Lilly and Company, two pharmaceutical companies, each developed a COVID-19 monoclonal antibody treatment, which the Food and Drug Administration approved in November.
The antibody treatment is administered to aid patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms and reduces their hospitalization chances, according to assistant professor of medicine Tara Vijayan.
Vijayan also said there appear to be no significant side effects to the treatment despite ongoing research.
However, there have been a few hurdles in ensuring the antibody treatments are available to the public. Alexandra Bowie, a spokesperson for Regeneron, said in an emailed statement the recent surge in infections coincided with the antibody rollout in many states, making it difficult to distribute.
Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott to conclude term after 11 years in position
The Pac-12 CEO group announced Wednesday Larry Scott’s 11-year stint as Pac-12 commissioner will end in June.
Pac-12 revenues steadily increased from $100 million annually to $500 million under Scott. However, the commissioner drew criticism after rejecting an ESPN deal to distribute the Pac-12 Networks.
Scott was also under scrutiny for securing millions in bonuses when the Pac-12 conference and its media company were financially hurt by the COVID-19 pandemic.
Before joining the Pac-12 in 2009, Scott served as the CEO of the Women‘s Tennis Association for six years.
UCLA gymnastics announces 2021 meet schedule, season opener against Arizona State
UCLA gymnastics will begin its season Saturday at 2 p.m. against Arizona State at Pauley Pavilion.
The Bruins will face Arizona, Washington and Utah after Saturday‘s matchup. UCLA will conclude the season on March 13 against San Jose State.
Star Bruin gymnastics alumna Kyla Ross is set to return to UCLA gymnastics as an assistant coach. In addition to being a 2012 Olympic gold medalist, Ross was named the Pac-12 Gymnast of the Year in 2019 and 2020.
Ross‘ former coach and now colleague Chris Waller said he hopes Ross can provide stability for the team by sharing her experiences from past successes.

678,"(TNSPol) -- The Center for Responsible Lending issued the following statement:* * *Following Senator Raphael Warnock's (D-GA) introduction of the Senate companion to the Downpayment Toward Equity Act, which would allocate $100 billion in funding for first-time homebuyers, the National Fair Housing Alliance, the National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development, the National Urban League, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, the Center for Responsible Lending, UnidosUS, and the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights issued the following statement.""Homeownership remains one of the most important drivers of wealth creation, yet it remains elusive for many socially and economically disadvantaged families. Our organizations applaud Senator Raphael Warnock and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Sherrod Brown (D-OH) for introducing the Downpayment Toward Equity Act in the U.S. Senate. If enacted, this crucial targeted down payment-assistance legislation has the potential to create 5 million first-generation homebuyers, including 1.7 million Black and 1.32 million Latino borrowers.""Homeownership--long a core element to achieving the American Dream--has become increasingly unattainable for millions of American families, with communities of color faring the worst. The current Black homeownership rate is as low as it was in 1890 and 1968 when the Fair Housing Act was enacted. The Latino homeownership rate is 25 points lower than the white homeownership rate. This unfortunate reality, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic's disproportionate harm on American communities least able to shoulder the burden, has resulted in an ever-widening homeownership gap that has left communities of color behind with little capital to invest in wealth-building opportunities. It is with this and our nation's long and unfortunate history of excluding communities of color from sustainable homeownership opportunities in mind that civil rights and housing equity organizations work tirelessly to ensure that our nation's housing policy reflects the needs of all communities equitably.""The inclusion of targeted, well-funded down payment assistance legislation in the upcoming reconciliation package can help begin to reverse the myriad barriers that have kept families of color from building generational wealth while advancing a more equitable economy that benefits all Americans.""There is no racial equality without economic equity.

680," Health system awarded $2.5 million grant by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help expand use of affordable, ultra-high throughput PCR test for employees with goal of wider adoption  Jason Molinet  516-321-6705  jmolinet@northwell.edu  Northwell Health Labs today announced that it has begun using LabGold, a low-cost, highly-reliable polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test with a self-collected specimen to screen employees for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with plans to expand its use through a $2.5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211004005843/en/ The nasal swab, which looks like a Q-tip and screws into a tube the size of a pen cap, was developed through funding from the Gates Foundation in conjunction with Corteva Agriscience, Quantigen and SteriPack. Northwell and United Kingdom-based LGC received authorization for LabGold at the Northwell Health Labs through the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on August 20 after validating the test internally.  “Diagnostic testing has been a crucial step in combating the virus. This affordable, self-administered swab is a game changer in the fight against COVID-19,” said Dwayne Breining, MD, executive director of Northwell Health Labs. “We can process LabGold specimens quickly and cheaply, helping to stop the spread of COVID-19 in its tracks.”  After extended use by employees as part of routine workforce infection surveillance, LabGold will be rolled out to the public. The goal is to support employee and school screening programs, as well as underserved communities. The nasal specimen can be self-collected in the privacy of the home for personal use or at work as part of routine company-wide screening. If self-administered at home, the specimen can be dropped off at any Northwell Health Labs patient service center for processing.  Unlike nasopharyngeal swabs, which require a health care worker to administer and collect a specimen deep inside the nasal cavity, LabGold swabs can be inserted just inside the nose by the individual. The collection process is painless and – most importantly – safe because it limits exposure for others.  “The ability to initiate testing untethers COVID-19 screening from the hassles and frustrations of going to a health care facility or testing site, and puts the power of health and wellness in the hands of the public,” said James Crawford, MD, senior vice president of laboratory services at Northwell. “Importantly, this convenient test is still the high-sensitivity PCR assay that has been the bedrock of COVID-19 testing throughout the pandemic. This maximizes our ability to detect COVID, and thus reduce the chance of COVID exposure and workplace or community spread.”  Northwell’s ultra-high throughput PCR test costs a fraction of current tests. Using a portal accessed from any smartphone or computer, the person being tested self-registers and use the phone’s camera to scan a barcoded tube containing the swab. This links that individual to that specimen tube. LGC’s Nexar automated, high throughput platform can process up to 100,000 LabGold specimens per day on a single testing line.  Northwell has processed more than 300,000 PCR tests for employees alone since the start of the year and – as a leader in health system-based lab testing since the beginning of the pandemic – delivered COVID-19 test results on over 3 million samples overall dating back to March 2020.  For more information about Northwell Health Labs, go to: https://www.northwell.edu/northwell-health-labs  About Northwell Health  Northwell Health is New York State’s largest health care provider and private employer, with 23 hospitals, 830 outpatient facilities and more than 16,600 affiliated physicians.

682,"Feb. 19With money almost tapped out, a stressed Trey Atwood and his wife, Erin, knew their Cross-eyed Owl Brewery was to be another victim of the coronavirus pandemic.
Business in the tap room was down 50%. Distribution from suppliers was hit hard after the virus moved into the area in March.
""We ran out of money,"" Atwood said. ""We had gone through all the stimulus money. We had put up our house as collateral. There was no way we were going to survive.""
Atwood made the announcement Oct. 20: Cross-eyed Owl would close for good Oct. 31.
But then a savior in the form of an investor stepped forward, and Decatur's first and only microbrewery remains alive three months later.
""It was such a relief. I got lucky and won the lottery,"" Atwood said. ""I'm surprised we haven't seen more businesses go under.""
Local businesses are surviving for the most part, with the exception of some that have already closed.
James Payne, Calhoun Community College dean of business and computer information systems, said it's hard to know if a closure is related to the pandemic and the emergency orders, which require social distancing and impose seating limits, or if it's a closure for mismanagement, failure to attract business or problems with getting needed supplies.
""You're always going to lose some in the restaurant and retail business by rule,"" Payne said. ""All eyes are on the economy but not all closures are as they seem.""
On Jan. 31, Sam's Sports Grill, on Beltline Road Southwest, shut its doors for good. Anna Jones closed her business, Breathe Yoga Barre' on Second Avenue Southeast, on Dec. 31, her husband Tyler Jones said.
""Exercise businesses were among the hardest hit,"" Tyler Jones said.
Other businesses that announced their closings in Decatur were Social Grace's and Gyro Uno. Strayer University closed its Decatur offices.
Sal Jasso, of the city of Decatur's Revenue Department, said he didn't see a lot of closures in 2020. He's still collecting business license fees, which are based on how much a business made in the last year.
""We won't know how many have closed until they notify us,"" Jasso said.
Payne said the area is seeing the restaurant business pick up as people become more comfortable going out, especially as more get their COVID-19 vaccine shots.
Christy Wheat, who co-owns Simp McGhee's and Josie's with her husband John Wheat, said they're seeing an increase in business lately but that business travelers disappeared in March.
""We've been saved by our local customers,"" she said.
Craig Johnston, executive director of the Lawrence County Chamber of Commerce, said his business, The Willow Tree in Moulton, closed its doors May 30 because of the economic slowdown brought on by COVID-19.
Johnston said Dixie Deals, a bargain surplus store in Moulton, closed a few months ago.
The Willow Tree was an artisan market that also sold antiques and collectibles.
""COVID-19 definitely impacted sales for me,"" said Johnston. ""If the pandemic hadn't hit, without a doubt I believe I would still be in business.""
He said his business was displaced after the April 22, 2018, fire on the Moulton Square. ""My new location was not as good, but COVID certainly didn't help things.""  Signs of hope
Athens has lost Shoney's, Ruby Tuesday's and Hardee's on U.S. 72, but Mayor Ronnie Marks said he didn't know if COVID-19 was the major factor in the closures. Also closed is the Pizza Hut on U.S. 31.
""I don't know of any downtown businesses (that closed),"" Marks said. ""We're really doing well even though it's hard. We've seen a good uptick in our sales tax revenue.""
In 2020, Athens added Frame Gallery, Nutrition on the Square, Country Financial, Synovus Mortgage and an insurance firm, Stumbaugh Agency LLC. The Epiphany Boutique and Square Clock Coffee moved to a bigger location. They operate together on the Square at the corner of Jefferson and Market streets. A Chipotle is set to open in the former Dairy Queen location on U.S. 72.
Crystal Brown, vice president of the Decatur-Morgan County Chamber of Commerce, said she's not surprised north Alabama businesses are surviving.
""I'm not going to say it's not hard because of the coronavirus but, just like in (the recession of) 2008, north Alabama hasn't been hit as hard as other parts of the country,"" Brown said.
Brown pointed out that about a half dozen new restaurants opened or are planning to open in Decatur. ALDI is constructing its new grocery store on Beltline Road.
Payne said it's not unusual for large chain restaurants to move forward with plans despite short-term economic headwinds. Chipotle recently opened on Beltline Road.
""A lot of these big companies have deep pockets and they see Decatur as a long-term investment,"" Payne said.  Job market
Payne said the big issue remains unemployment, which in Morgan County was 2.8% in December (the most recent data available), 0.6 percentage points higher than in pre-pandemic December 2019. He said one of the reasons unemployment is not even higher is the number of people who just left the workforce. In Morgan, 1,613 fewer people were in the workforce in December than the year before, and almost 2,000 fewer people were employed than in December 2019.
""Some just chose to retire or they dropped out because they have no prospects right now,"" Payne said. ""A good chunk of those who dropped out are just temporary.""
Payne said many people are also seeing their hours cut back as businesses limit operating hours to save money.
Christy Wheat said the federal COVID-19 relief payments and the small business loans the government later forgave last spring were a lifeline.
""I don't want to say they're why we could stay open but they definitely helped,"" she said.
Payne said he's not a proponent of government bailouts. However, he said last spring's bailout was necessary ""to keep the economy from falling off the cliff.""
""It was important to pump money into the economy to prop up spending and jobs,"" Payne said.
While the local economy is improving, Marks said people should continue to be wary of the virus.
""We need to keep the coronavirus on our radar and continue to shop local,"" Marks said. ""Families are struggling and the coronavirus is still a big problem.

683,"Amid Republican efforts here and nationally to curtail mail-in voting, more than 600,000 Pennsylvania voters have applied to do so in the May 18 primary.
The State Department said that 587,000 voters have applied for mail-in ballots and about 18,000 are seeking traditional absentee ballots.
""These impressive application numbers show that mail-in voting has become a popular option for Pennsylvanians, valued for its convenience, accessibility and security,"" said acting Secretary of State Veronica Degraffenreid in a statement. ""People like being able to vote from their own homes and on their own schedule.""
She added that, ""If mail ballot applications continue at this pace, we could be on track to set a record for participation in a municipal primary.""
In March 2020, then-Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said that more than 22,000 voters had requested mail-in ballots and 40,000 had asked for traditional absentee ballots for the April 28 primary that was later moved to June 2.
Last year, though, was the first time the state offered no-excuse mail-in voting and, with voters concerned about COVID-19, about 2.6 million Pennsylvanians voted by mail in the 2020 general election.
Nearly two-thirds of those voting by mail were Democrats, which helped Joe Biden clinch the presidency.
Even though Act 77 of 2019 was passed in a bipartisan manner by the GOP-led Legislature, Republicans turned against mail-in voting after President Joe Biden won Pennsylvania and former President Donald Trump began launching false accusations against mail-in voting, many of which continue to be echoed by Republican legislators.
While other states, such as Georgia, have been in the headlines for its dubious efforts to curb voting access, there have been similar bills introduced in Pennsylvania, such as one from state Rep. Michael Puskaric, an Allegheny County Republican, that would repeal mail-in voting.
Applications for mail-in and absentee ballots must be submitted to county boards of elections by 5 p.m. on May 11. Once marked with votes, the mail-in ballots must be returned to the boards by 8 p.m. on May 18. Additional information on voting in Pennsylvania is available at votesPA.com.

686,"Rep. Chris Jacobs, R-New York, issued the following news release on July 19, 2021:Congressman Chris Jacobs (NY-27) held a press conference this morning with Jim Butera, President of the WNY Chapter of the NYS Restaurant Association and owner of Butera's Craft Beer and Craft Pizza, to discuss the labor shortage caused in part by enhanced unemployment benefits.""I consistently hear from small businesses in my district that have multiple open positions and cannot find anyone willing to work. In February, against numerous warnings, Democrats and President Biden forced through a massive partisan package filled with unnecessary spending. The result is they have made it more lucrative to stay home than to seek employment,"" Jacobs said. ""This has become detrimental to our economic recovery, and many businesses are losing money, shortening hours, or closing down entirely because they cannot find employees. Unfortunately, this translates to longer wait times, higher prices, and shortages of numerous products families need.""""The government keeps providing stimulus money instead of encouraging people to find and get employment, and it is hurting my business and all those around me. This is equivalent to 'give a man a fish and feed him for a day, teach a man to fish feed him for life.' Our government needs to end disincentives, get back to working for the people, and make our economic recovery and small businesses a priority,"" Jim Butera, President WNY Chapter of the NYS Restaurant Association and owner of Butera's Craft Beer and Craft Pizza, said.Jacobs introduced the Help Wanted Act (H.R. 3148) in May to combat these disincentives and prioritize our economic recovery. Specifically, the legislation: 1) restores work search requirements, 2) removes the expansion of unemployment to individuals who voluntarily left their job, and 3) clarifies that general safety concerns related to COVID-19 are no longer sufficient grounds to claim unemployment benefits.""Our regional economy relies heavily on the service industry and manufacturing - the businesses hurt most by this government spending,"" Jacobs said. ""The President's reckless spending has forced businesses to compete with the government. As long as these benefits remain in place, businesses will continue to struggle from massive labor shortages, prices will increase, and supply chains will suffer. I call on the House to consider the Help Wanted Act to end these disincentives to work.""MSTRUCK-7545593 MSTRUCK",Rep. Jacobs Calls for End to Disincentives to Work

694,"Apr. 13 - SUFFIELD  -  Jason Flynn smiled broadly as he stepped onto the diamond for the Suffield High baseball team's season opener against Windsor Locks on Monday, grateful that the program's nearly two-year hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was coming to an end.
The coach's smile only grew wider as the game wore on.
Junior Nick Gomes allowed one unearned run in five innings in his first varsity start to lead the Wildcats to a 7-3 NCCC victory at Suffield's Kulas Field.
""It was great to be back out there,"" Flynn said. ""We had to wait a long time. I'm blessed with a lot of kids who are committed baseball players. They played in the summer and fall and were ready for the season.""
Gomes scattered two hits and struck out 12 in the win. The left-hander walked three.
""It was a surreal moment, I didn't know how it was going to go,"" Gomes said. ""I was anxious to start off the game, but I barreled down. After the second inning, the butterflies left. It was great. I really enjoyed the experience.""
Michael Jubrey was saddled with the loss. The right-hander allowed six runs on five hits in three innings of work. He struck out four and walked two.
""We're a young team with only a couple seniors,"" Windsor Locks coach Ken Precourt said. ""We had a lot of underclassman playing their first varsity game. It's tough, but overall we played pretty well.""
Mason Ferrari had two hits and two RBIs for the Wildcats (1-0). Colin Hinckley provided the lone RBI for the Raiders (0-1).
Windsor Locks visits Coventry on Wednesday. Suffield travels to Ellington on Friday.
Suffield last played on May 29, 2019, in the first round of the Class M state tournament. The Wildcats fell to East Catholic 3-2 in 10 innings.
Windsor Locks last played on May 30, 2019, in the second round of the Class S tournament. The Raiders bowed to Terryville 4-3.
The CIAC canceled the 2020 state tournaments on April 23 before canceling the season altogether on May 5.
In March, the CIAC unveiled its spring sports plan. Baseball teams will play full season schedules and state tournaments will be held for the first time since the winter of 2020.
The baseball tournaments are scheduled to begin June 1, with championship games taking place June 11-12.
Ryan Barthel reached on a Wildcats error to begin the game and advanced to third on two passed balls. After back-to-back strikeouts, Hinckley ripped a single to right to put Windsor Locks up 1-0.
Suffield answered with five runs in the bottom of the second on a balk, an error, a wild pitch, and a two-run single from Ferrari to take a 5-1 lead.
The Wildcats tacked a run on in the bottom of the third and another in the fourth to stretch their lead to 7-1 after four.
Suffield brought in reliever Sam Beaudoin in the top of the sixth inning, but the sophomore threw two consecutive wild pitches to give the Raiders two runs and was replaced by Chase Tyburski.
Tyburski gave up a single to the first batter he faced but struck out Barthel and Dalton Wright, the No. 1 and 2 hitters in the Raiders' lineup, to end the threat.
The Raiders put runners on first and second with two outs in the seventh but Tyburski got a strikeout to close out the game.
""One of the things we talked about with our pitchers after the game was managing the pitch count,"" Flynn said. ""With the 110 maximum, I had no choice but to take out Gomes at the end of the fifth. Sam is an electric pitcher, but he's young. He's a sophomore. He's learning. And then Chase came in in a tough situation and pounded the zone and got it done. It speaks to his mental toughness.""
ELLINGTON 9, SOMERS 5. In Ellington, Matt Mateya ripped a three-run homer and scored three times in the host Knights' NCCC win.
Ellington (1-1) trailed 1-0 before scoring nine unanswered runs in the third through fifth innings, which included Mateya's homer in the fourth. Somers (0-2) got to within 9-4 in the sixth on Alex Grenier's three-run-homer but added only one in the seventh to account for the final.
Noah Madore added three hits for the Knights and pitched 6Î innings to get the victory on the mound. He struck out seven. Ethan Sgarlata chipped in two hits. Cody Palazzesi added two hits and two RBIs while Colby McCormick had two hits and scored twice for the Spartans.
Ellington is at Rockville Wednesday, the same day Somers entertains Stafford.
EAST GRANBY 15, COVENTRY 3. In Coventry, the Patriots' first game since winning the 2019 Class S tournament championship was one they'd like to forget as East Granby rolled to an NCCC win.
Ethan Laktomy pitched a complete game to earn the win for the Crusaders (2-0). Ethan Hunt took the loss for Coventry (0-1).
The Patriots host Windsor Locks Wednesday.
EAST CATHOLIC 6, CONARD 1. In West Hartford, Frankie Mozzicato pitched 5 1/3 innings of one-hit ball, recording all of his 16 outs via strikeout, as East Catholic picked up the CCC interdivisional win.
The left-hander walked four and only Luis Vargas had a hat against him. TJ Winn got the final five outs for the save.
Ryan St. Jean's two-run double plated Alex Irizarry and Ryan Shaw to put the Eagles (1-0) in front. Conard would cut the gap in half in the fourth but East Catholic answered with single runs in the fifth and sixth and iced it in the seventh on St. Jean's two-run hit. Hank Penders chipped in two hits for the Eagles.
East Catholic visits Wethersfield on Wednesday
ENFIELD 12, NW CATHOLIC 4. In West Hartford, Brandon Rowe had three hits and scored three runs to pace Enfield to a CCC interdivisional win.
The Eagles (2-0) took a 4-0 first-inning lead. Northwest Catholic (0-1) pulled within 5-3 before Enfield scored three in the fifth and three more in the sixth to regain command.
Thomas Kluntz added two hits and drove in three runs for the Eagles. Max Chipman also had three hits and scored twice. Justin Chaplin pitched six innings of six-hit ball for the win. He allowed three runs (one earned) with two walks and two strikeouts. He helped his own cause with a pair of RBIs.
Enfield travels to Newington on Wednesday.
WINDSOR 11, AVON 1. In Windsor, winning pitcher Jeremy Blackwood had a two-run single in an eight-run second inning in the Warriors' CCC interdivisional win.
Julian Rivera had two hits and scored twice for Windsor (1-0). Jon Lattimer drove in a pair of runs. Blackwood pitched four innings and allowed two hits and an unearned run. He struck out four.
Windsor hosts South Windsor Wednesday.
NEWINGTON 8, SOUTH WINDSOR 3. In South Windsor, Newington scored four runs in the fourth inning to take the lead and added three runs in the fifth of a CCC interdivisional win.
The Bobcats (0-1) scored all three of their runs in the third inning to go up 3-1 with Drew Mabey's RBI single giving them what proved to be a short-lived lead.
South Windsor is at Windsor Wednesday.
MANCHESTER 4, WILCOX TECH 3. At Mt Nebo in Manchester, Nate Heimer scored the winning run on a balk in the bottom of the seventh inning as the host Red Hawks captured their season opener.
Manchester led 3-0 until Wilcox Tech got even with a three-run sixth. In the seventh, Heimer singled and went to third on Alec Bairos' infield hit. Tyler Barry walked to load the bases. After a strikeout, Gio Morales worked the count full. Then on a 3-2 pitch, Morales' request for time out was denied but the pitch stopped his windup as he was about to throw the ball, leading to the balk call.
Heimer, Bairos, and Ben Cherry had two hits each for Manchester. Mason Cycenas-Heimer allowed six hits and three runs, striking out five, in six innings before sophomore Dennis Flores pitched a perfect seventh to earn the win in his first high school game.
The Red Hawks visit Norwich Tech Thursday.
EH 6, CIVIC LEADERSHIP 5. At McKenna Field, Jacob Carrion fifth-inning RBI single gave East Hartford a lead it would not relinquish in a non-conference game.
With the game 3-3, the senior singled home classmate Jacob Tipton to push the Hornets (1-0) ahead. They'd score another in the inning, and again in the sixth to take a 3-run lead into the seventh. Civic Leadership (0-1) cut the deficit to one thanks to a two-run single by Raul Mojica with two outs. But the sophomore was thrown out at second to end the game.
Carrion earned the win for the Hornets, pitching two innings of relief. Xavier Quiles recorded the save. Starter Jack Salvo allowed two runs and struck out seven in four innings. Caleb Claudio took the loss, allowing three earned runs while striking out eight.
East Hartford is at New Britain Wednesday while Civic Leadership is at Enfield Thursday.
EAST WINDSOR 10, MLC 4. In East Windsor, Shane Ritchie had two hits, two RBIs and was the wining pitcher as the host Panthers won a non-league game.
The Panthers (1-0) scored three runs in the first and never looked back. Jake Martin and Ryan Lee each had two hits and three runs scored for the hosts. Martin added two RBIs while Lee scored three runs and had four steals. Teammate Curt Zyra added two RBIS.
Ritchie came on for relief in the fourth inning. He finished with four strikeouts. Starter Anthony Heller took the loss for MLC (0-2).
The Panthers return to action Wednesday when they travel to Canton.

",Suffield's Gomes shuts down Windsor Locks in baseball
696,"Feb. 24There's some debate over the ability of the human mind to really comprehend numbers, especially as they get bigger.
Five is simple. One can easily picture five children playing, five flowers gathered into a bouquet.
Five hundred is manageable: 500 pennies stacked, 500 chairs in an auditorium.
Advertisement
Five thousand gets harder; 50,000 is harder still.
Add another zero  500,000  and the number is nearly incomprehensible, especially when that number is attached to death.
America reached a grim milestone Monday when the number of recorded deaths from COVID-19 hit 500,000.
A half-million residents of the United States have succumbed to this deadly pandemic in about a year.
Advertisement
As humans, we like to quantify, to count, to measure. And this loss of American lives will, indeed, be tallied in a multitude of ways: unearned and unspent dollars as calculated by economists; shifts in mortality and insurance rates as gauged and projected by epidemiologists and actuaries.
But there's no way to fully assess the impact of COVID-19, not numerically. Not really.
We can't count the number of tears shed. We can't measure the fear. We can't estimate the resolve to combat and conquer the scourge.
And so we tabulate. We compare. The loss to COVID-19 exceeds the battlefield deaths of World War I, World War II and Vietnam, combined. The loss to COVID-19 equals the population of Atlanta.
Worldwide, some 2.5 million fatalities have been recorded from COVID. The incident rate for illness is far higher: 28.2 million in the U.S.; 112 million in the world.
Some people believe all these numbers are so high they amount to an abstraction.
And that may be true  when it comes to the numbers.
But the numbers reflect people: our family, a neighbor, a friend of a friend.
Those who have been lost are not abstractions. The numbers do not tell their stories. That is left to us. And they will be remembered.

705,"
The relentless winter weather hammering states from the South to the Northeast this week has been blamed for at least 70 fatalities as of Friday, including many accidental deaths that were due to people trying to find ways to stay warm.
The two main storm systems that hit much of the country devastated areas that were largely unprepared for heavy snowfall and sub-freezing temperatures - especially Texas, where dozens of deaths have been linked to the extreme weather, which caused power outages and had U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, a Republican, fleeing to a resort in Mexico with his family.
A sheepish Cruz had to return to his stricken state a day later amid intense backlash at his tone-deaf trip to Cancun.
Millions of Texans spent days without electricity and many are now dealing with water and food shortages in an unprecedented disaster for the state. The power outages left residents across the region without any heat or hot water, forcing many of them to improvise as they desperately tried to keep their families warm.
A grandmother and her 8-year-old daughter died from carbon monoxide poisoning in Houston after leaving a car running in an attached garage to generate heat inside their home, police said. Hundreds of others from Texas to Oregon were hospitalized with signs of carbon monoxide poisoning this week.
Authorities in multiple states are also investigating reports of people dying from hypothermia.
In rural Kentucky, the deaths of at least two women - one who was 86 years old and the other 77 - have also been blamed on freezing temps, a local coroner told news outlets.
Other deaths appear to involve tragic accidents in icy outdoor areas. At least two of them happened in Tennessee, including a 10-year-old boy who fell into a partially frozen pond and a 77-year-old farmer who died while trying to save two calves that had wandered into a pond, according to officials. In Louisiana, a 50-year-old man was killed after slipping on ice and hitting his head on the ground, authorities said.
The death toll was likely to grow as local officials conduct wellness checks over the next few days. Fire and police officials across the country urged people to check on their neighbors to make sure they're OK.
The storms across the South and up into the Northeast also stymied efforts to vaccinate Americans against COVID-19. The snow and power outages hobbled transportation hubs and highways.
That has created challenges for carriers such as UPS and FedEx, which have been on the front lines packaging and shipping the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines around the country. Both UPS's hub in Louisville, Ky., and FedEx's key hub in Memphis, Tenn., were affected. Meanwhile, several states have complained about vaccination delays and had to cancel appointments.
The fact that 6 million doses have languished in airport hubs for several days during a once-in-a-century pandemic has raised questions about how the U.S. government and the nation's largest shipping companies haven't been able - so far at least - to break the logjam.
White House officials say the snowstorms and power outages created a variety of challenges that slowed vaccination efforts in different ways. First, shippers like FedEx, UPS, and pharmaceutical distributor McKesson had to deal with workers who were snowed-in and couldn't package, ship the vaccine kits and do other jobs. Then, road closures in many states kept trucks from delivering the vaccines. Finally, more than 2,000 vaccination sites were in areas with power outages.
FedEx says it's relying on other hubs around the country to fix the problem. That includes its shipping hub in Indianapolis - the company's second largest after Memphis - and regional sorting hubs like the ones in Oakland, Calif., and Newark. FedEx says it's not warehousing any COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.
UPS has been less forthcoming, saying only that it has ""extensive contingency plans"" to keep goods moving when roadways are impassable or airports are closed because of severe weather.

706,"Joe Biden was elected president after a campaign rooted in rhetoric emphasizing unity, moderation, and compromise. But with every day that passes, the veneer of centrism that got him elected over rivals such as Sen. Bernie Sanders becomes more distant a memory.
Simply put, it sure seems like “moderate Joe” was a thin facade used to usher an ultra-progressive agenda in the backdoor. It resembles a Trojan horse: the famous hollow wooden horse, secretly filled with soldiers, that was given by the Greeks to the Trojans during the famed Trojan War. Once taken inside the impenetrable walls of Troy, Greek soldiers burst out of the horse and opened the gates to let in the besieging army.
Biden’s centrist facade got him in the door, and now the liberal hordes are taking over his administration. On Friday, the White House announced a commission to study the idea of packing the Supreme Court, an idea that would constitute a partisan assault on the judiciary as we know it and erode the rule of law.
This flirtation with radicalism is just the latest development in a series of extreme Biden administration policy overhauls that make former President Barack Obama seem like a conservative in comparison. For example, the president has embraced a federal $15 minimum wage, a job-killing policy rejected even by then-candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, and even tried to force it through as small businesses were struggling to survive amid the pandemic. 
And Biden’s early approach to spending makes the New Deal pale in comparison. He has utterly discarded any semblance of fiscal restraint he ever had as a senator, throwing caution to the wind to push through a $1.9 trillion partisan COVID-19 “stimulus” package that, adjusted for inflation and population, is twice the size of the Obama-era bailout and slightly larger than former President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal.
To make the extreme nature of this spending even more apparent, consider that Biden immediately followed this plan up with a plan for at least $2.25 trillion more in so-called “infrastructure” spending. To put that gargantuan figure in context, it’s an additional $15,701 per federal taxpayer on top of the $6 trillion-plus we’ve already spent over the last year.
Of course, less than half of this “infrastructure” money is actually transportation infrastructure spending. From $20 billion blown out on “racial and environmental justice” to $175 billion for electric vehicle subsidies to hundreds of billions for public schools and public housing, it’s a ""Green New Deal""-style partisan spending blowout masquerading as unobjectionable transportation legislation.
Add this up, and just in the first few months of his presidency, Biden has passed or proposed spending equivalent to double the New Deal. So much for centrism, huh?
Biden’s campaign rhetoric about moderation, unity, and compromise was, if one believed it, refreshing and encouraging. But after the first few months of this administration, it’s clear that it was all smoke and mirrors — a Trojan horse masking a man who has been co-opted by a sweeping liberal agenda.

707,"TAMPA, Fla. — When Steve Cutter’s landlord unexpectedly sold the house he was renting, his family had to spend $2,300 a month on a New Port Richey, Florida, motel room to avoid sleeping in their car. The monthly $300 he and his wife received from the IRS for their 6-year-old was, he said, the difference between “eating ramen every night of the month or getting actual food.”When Tampa’s Melody Richardson and her husband caught COVID-19 and couldn’t work for most of August, the $500 per month child tax credit meant groceries for their two teen daughters. When her husband, Reginald, died from the virus in September, that money became “our survival.”When the pandemic forced St. Petersburg’s Peter Jensen out of a job, he said, he wound up working part time while taking classes to become a certified Harley-Davidson technician. He hoped to earn more to support the two teen daughters he has sole custody of and two younger sons who live with him part time.He maxed out his credit card, fell months behind on rent and, he said, “I was probably two weeks from getting my car repoed.” Monthly $800 child tax credit payments kicked in then, saving him. “Without that money, we were looking at an eviction. It filled in the little holes everywhere.”The expanded child tax credit, part of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 signed into law by President Joe Biden in March, officially expired in January.The law increased an already-existing federal child tax credit from a maximum of $2,000 per child in 2020 to $3,000 per child under 18, and $3,600 per child under 6. And instead of making parents wait for that money in their tax return this spring, the IRS disbursed some of it in monthly installments of $250 or $300 per child since July.It also made the credit fully refundable, meaning even families with no earned income that owed no federal taxes could receive it.Some Tampa Bay parents who received advance payments over those six months described them to the Tampa Bay Times as a lifeline. Some said the money wasn’t critical, but it certainly helped out. A few said they’d opted out of the advance payments and preferred to get it all back as a lump sum at tax time.Unless Congress takes action to extend the tax credit changes, the final advance payments were made in December, and the amount of the annual credit would revert back to lower 2020 amounts. The Democrats’ Build Back Better bill, which has stalled in Congress, would have extended the increased tax credits through 2022.The child tax credit in 2021 was more generous than ever before, said Florida State University professor Luke Rodgers, who researches how tax policy affects families. That meant more money reaching more families than would have benefited previously.Low-income families benefit the most, experts say, and data shows that people are spending the money as it was intended — on rent, child care and food. That money flows back into the economy, said Norín Dollard, a senior policy analyst with the Florida Policy Institute.“It really does help to start to close the income gap,” said Dollard, who noted families of color tend to be disproportionately burdened by poverty.On the other hand, some view it as an expensive undertaking and wonder if families most in need could be targeted through previously existing programs — like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — to save costs, said Rodgers, the economics professor.Some economists may wonder, too, if the payments reduce incentives to work. But the data suggests, Dollard said, that is not happening.”If we want healthy, thriving kids,” she said, “reducing poverty is an excellent way to go about that.”Results of a Morning Consult/Politico poll in late December showed voters are divided over whether the child tax credit should continue another year, with 47 percent in favor of and 42 percent opposed.Crystal Merens works in human resources and is a single mother with children ages 3, 6 and 9 in New Port Richey. The 36-year-old used her monthly payments of $550 on before- and after-school care for the two oldest kids. Monthly child care, she said, costs as much as her mortgage.What was left she used for groceries and car insurance, expenses she said that rose significantly in recent months.

She said the thought of missing her children’s sporting events to work depresses her.“I’ve seen how (the child tax credit) has helped lift children out of poverty,” Merens said. “It’s not free money, you’re just getting half your tax refund early, it’s not hurting anybody.”Merens said she does not receive any child support and earns too much to receive other government assistance.

709,"Two Lancaster Nursing and Rehabilitation Center residents recently ended up in an emergency room due to the facility’s failure to keep them safe, one after nursing home officials failed to act for more than 12 hours after learning he had gone missing from the facility.
The incidents that led to the emergency room visits, laid out in reports by state inspectors, as well as interviews with people who have been inside the facility and contacted LNP | LancasterOnline to express concern, paint a worrisome picture of conditions inside the 446-bed operation, which came under new ownership in April.
The first incident that led to an emergency room visit came in August when a resident needed a transfusion of red blood cells after receiving blood thinner meant for another resident. A month later, a second, separate problem left the facility with a $32,500 fine as a result of putting residents in “immediate jeopardy,” one of the highest levels of violations set defined in federal rules.

The fine stems from an incident when, under the direction of the facility’s administration, staff did not contact police for more than 12 hours after a quadriplegic man in a battery-operated wheelchair didn’t return or answer his phone after a permitted leave from the home that was to last a few hours.
“This is outrageous conduct,” said David Hoffman, a former chief counsel at the Pennsylvania Department of Aging and federal prosecutor. Hoffman’s consulting firm has served as a court-appointed monitor of long-term care facilities. “To not call the police – I'm just stunned, I’m stunned by it.”
The two incidents follow a yearly inspection in June that found glaring deficiencies at the home, including a failure to maintain the state’s minimum staffing levels – a threshold already much lower than the industry standard for providing high quality care.
 ‘High risk’ of potential harm 
According the most recent report, a quadriplegic man with permission to leave the building by himself failed to come back at his stated return time in the evening of Sept. 22. Although the facility’s top administrators were made aware after 11 p.m., they did not direct staff to contact the police to try to find the man until around 6:30 the next morning.
Three hours later, administrators learned the man was at an area emergency room claiming he had been robbed and punched in the face. Medical staff did not find any injuries on the man, the report said.
The September report also cited an incident with the same quadriplegic resident in August. One account describes an instance when his wheelchair battery died and he fell asleep outside the facility in the rain, according to the report. Another account in August from a nurse’s notes said a “concerned neighbor” called the facility and said the man’s wheelchair had stranded him by a park and needed help back “from an intersection,” the report said.
State inspectors pointed out that the failure to act immediately on Sept. 22 revealed a problem with the facility’s procedures, and therefore posed a risk for all residents who are allowed to leave independently with conditions.
“This failure placed 44 of 352 residents at high risk of potential for accidents, injury, or serious harm,” said the report’s findings, referring to the 44 residents who had permission from a doctor to leave the nursing home by themselves.
Just a month prior, state inspectors found that a resident mistakenly received another resident’s doses of Coumadin, a powerful blood thinner meant to treat blood clots, on Aug. 2 and 3.

The resident was only responsive when aroused the next day, and staff sent him to the emergency room, according to the report. The resident there received a transfusion of red blood cells, among other treatments, to reverse his condition.
A spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that regulates nursing homes, said the recent inspection findings from Sept. 24 resulted in a $32,500 fine.
Howard Hay, executive director at Lancaster Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, did not respond to an email that included questions regarding the recent violations.
 Family member frustrations 
State inspections after the facility’s ownership changed hands in the spring cited staffing issues, and conditions have since spurred several individuals to speak with LNP | LancasterOnline about their firsthand experiences there this summer and fall, their concerns for their loved ones living at Lancaster Nursing and an overworked staff.
They all said they are grateful for the remaining staff that have continued to take care of residents amid harrowing conditions. But they are frightened nonetheless by what they have witnessed, and family members expressed their exasperation by the lack of response from top administrators.
They each said they know little about the almost-never-seen new ownership, New Jersey-based Imperial Healthcare Group, which has no website, no phone number and no sign of a physical office. It purchased the facility in April and rebranded the home from its longstanding name, Conestoga View.
The new ownership group includes Chaim “Charlie” Steg of Lakewood, New Jersey, who is scheduled to be sentenced Thursday for pleading no contest in June to three counts of reckless endangerment, according to the state attorney general’s office. Those stem from a 2017 investigation that found that had Steg acted on pleas for more staffing, three residents would not have died from preventable injuries caused by neglect at a Philadelphia-area nursing home he managed.
Steg signed off on the purchase of then-Conestoga View in April, but as a condition of his probation, which will follow his sentence of six to 23 months of house arrest, he is no longer managing Lancaster Nursing or any other nursing homes in the commonwealth. The probation agreement also bars him from being a majority owner of any nursing homes in Pennsylvania for five years.
Nonetheless, people who have been inside Lancaster Nursing raise ongoing concerns about staffing.
Two individuals whose mothers both live at the facility told LNP | LancasterOnline they have found injuries undocumented by medical staff on their mothers’ bodies. An overextended and depleted staff can’t keep up with their medical needs and basic hygiene, they said, let alone provide an active lifestyle – itself a regulatory requirement.
The family members also pointed to smaller indignities that they said had an outsized impact on their loved ones’ mental health and ability to maintain their humanity. One example: administrators told them residents can’t get a haircut after the new owners removed a hairdresser that serviced the building back in April.
Another frustration: administrators resorted again to barring visitors, regardless of their vaccination status, from the facility for several weeks, due to a new COVID-19 outbreak this fall.
Family members’ requests for more information and answers ranging from the facility’s COVID-19 quarantine procedure to visitation policies and staffing levels have been largely unsuccessful, they said.
 Rehab patient speaks out 
Gwendolyn Bowers was the first rehabilitation patient at Lancaster Nursing and Rehabilitation Center since the start of the pandemic, she was told.
After a knee replacement surgery in June, she told LNP | LancasterOnline in July that she agreed for administrators at Lancaster General Hospital transfer her to Lancaster Nursing.
The 67-year-old arrived at Lancaster Nursing on a Wednesday, she said, to a fairly clean room and a pleasant, hardworking staff. “I didn’t meet one unkind person when I was there,” Bowers said.
But then the problems arose.
Bowers quickly realized the staff had an enormous workload. When she called for her pain medication it took two hours to get it, Bowers said. It hampered her ability to manage her post-surgery pain as she’d been instructed by her doctor, she said.
Bowers requested a bottle of water – she didn’t get it until two days later, she said. And that was only because a staff person gave her a bottle of water of her own, Bowers said.
When Bowers woke up one morning, she didn’t see any staff until 11 a.m., she said.
One meal was simply a piece of breaded fish by itself, she said.
Staff were unable to give her a chance to take a shower until five days after she was admitted, Bowers said.
“I survived, I'm good. I can handle damn near anything,” said Bowers, who went on to explain her reason for speaking out: “But I've always been an advocate for the vulnerable.”
An annual DOH inspection in June cited Lancaster Nursing for maintaining direct-care staffing levels below the state’s requirement of 2.7 hours per resident. In the span of two weeks, DOH officials found the facility averaged 2.4 hours per resident.
The administration of Gov. Tom Wolf in July announced its intention to increase the requirement to 4.1 hours per resident.
 Worries about mom 
A new COVID-19 outbreak this fall at Lancaster Nursing meant that Patricia Norcross has had few opportunities to see her 100-year-old mother, Dorothy.
Dorothy has taken a turn for the worse in the 18 months she’s lived at the nursing home during a pandemic, Norcross said. There is not enough staff to help her get out of bed on a regular basis, let alone provide activities to pass the time, Norcross said.
The first year of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed the 446-bed facility, designed to house four residents in each room. In the early months, it led Pennsylvania nursing homes in resident deaths. According to self-reported DOH data from October of this year, it ranked 8th in number of deaths.
But Norcross’s concerns deepened when she saw evidence of worsening conditions after the ownership change.
In June, a staff member she spoke to often told her about 50 of her colleagues had left, mostly for better paying jobs elsewhere, Norcross said.
“They’re still leaving,” Norcross said in November.
Norcross got a letter in the mail around the time of the facility’s ownership change, she said, informing her that haircuts for her mother would require an additional fee.
But no one has gotten a haircut since Imperial took over, Norcross said.
In her first visit in weeks, Norcross saw her mom had a new skin tear and a bruise that enveloped her forearm. She suspected another fall, but the facility didn’t give her any notification, a requirement.
Norcross has fought several times with administrators for permission to personally help with her mother’s care.
Under federal nursing home regulations, family members can become “compassionate caregivers,” when a resident is close to death or having trouble adjusting to life away from home, with no family around for long periods of time.
But Norcross said Lancaster Nursing administrators have repeatedly denied her requests to become a compassionate caregiver because of concerns regarding the spread of COVID-19.
Federal authorities released guidance in March 2021 saying facilities can take steps to allow compassionate caregivers in nursing homes, even during an outbreak.
When Norcross challenged an administrator on their reasoning in one instance, “I was just told, ‘The owners don’t want it,’” she said.
Lancaster Nursing Executive Director Hay did not respond to an email that included questions regarding these allegations.
 ‘Educate and audit’ criticized 
Federal and state health officials have powers beyond fines to ensure nursing homes address problems. Those include bans on admitting new patients, additional monitoring and even installing a temporary replacement to head the facility’s operations.
It’s unclear if health officials did anything else to sanction Lancaster Nursing beyond the $32,500 fine this year.
State inspectors' reports on the most recent incidents in the facility includes a response from administrators about how they will address the violations. The September report said Lancaster Nursing reviewed the conditions of every resident who is allowed to leave the facility on their own and educated staff on the policy. The administrators also pledged to report the results of random audits of the logs that show residents are signing out and back into the facility.
Those steps don’t address why the problems occurred in the first place, Hoffman said, and what went wrong.
""‘Education and audit’ without identification of the underlying causes for systemic failures is not going to fix this,” he said.
In November, Norcross finally got to visit her mother up in her room for the first time in almost two years, she said. The area was dirty, she said. She later came back and spent six hours cleaning the room, she said.
Other residents were starved for attention and surrounded her during her visit with her mom.
“They came right over, and my mom was getting mad, because they wanted attention and my mom wanted it too,” Norcross said.
Norcross said she’s been able to build relationships with staff members at Lancaster Nursing and fight for her mom when she doesn’t like what she sees.
But that’s not the case with many of the 350 or so residents at the home.
“There’s people in there no one’s advocating for,” Norcross said.

713,"New York governments braced for financial disaster when the coronavirus hit – but a year later they're set for a massive injection of federal stimulus money.
The $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan came with $12.6 billion in relief for New York State government and another $10.8 billion that will go directly to counties and local municipalities.
It is an unprecedented windfall for municipalities to try to close budget gaps and find ways to revive their local economies amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Local officials will have broad discretion on how to spend the money, which can be used to cover revenue losses from the pandemic or to provide aid to industries like tourism and travel.
""I think the word unprecedented is the correct one,"" said Jonas Shaenda, chief economist at the Fiscal Policy Institute, a union-backed think tank in New York.
""The depth of the fall I think is quite remarkable, and it's something we've never seen before. There is a lot of damage that needs to be addressed.""
A million New York jobs were lost in 2020 due to the pandemic, representing some 10% of the statewide workforce. Unemployment shot up from 3.8% in early 2020 to 8.7% by year's end.
The aid will come to New York State government as it works to close a $15 billion budget gap for the upcoming fiscal year that starts Thursday. The sides might still raise taxes to close the remaining deficit.
In New York City alone, there was a reported $1.5 billion revenue decline and $5.9 billion in unexpected expenses due to the pandemic.
Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro said making the money available directly to counties and local governments prevented officials from having to ""jump through hoops"" to apply through a grant program run by the state.
Now municipalities are figuring out how it will spend the money.
""Obviously, I'm very happy about"" the funding, said Dan Mandell, the mayor of Elmira, which is getting about $31 million in federal aid; the city's whole budget is about $39 million.
""We just have to find out what the exact parameters are.""
Local governments assess
impact of federal aid
The first two rounds of stimulus packages by Congress omitted direct aid to state and local governments, with some Republicans in particular arguing against it.
But when Democrats took the control in Washington this year, they included $350 billion nationwide for municipalities and state governments, as well as billions more for schools, in the stimulus package approved March 10.
Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said earlier this month it was critical to ensure part of the aid went directly to local governments.
""I made sure that it didn't go all to the state, because when it goes to the state, the localities often don't see it,"" Schumer told the USA TODAY Network New York after the bill passed.
Dutchess County, which will pull in $57 million, offered an early retirement incentive and furloughs last year as part of almost $18 million worth of cuts in its $500 million budget, Molinaro said.
""All of the core services that residents expect, certainly in an emergency in a difficult time, county governments deliver,"" Molinaro said during a COVID-19 roundtable earlier this month hosted by Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-Cold Spring, Putnam County.
""So this aid will allow us to reestablish that infrastructure and really again begin to rebuild from our losses.""
The latest stimulus offers governments of all size in the state the type of infusion most rarely have seen, steadying shaky budgets and offering the possibility of governments taking on construction projects — from a new sidewalk to all new broadband infrastructure. Shaenda said direct aid to governments, alongside other recovery spending, is not only a stopgap measure to keep people working but should create new opportunities to grow the state economy through infrastructure projects.
""This is where the public spending comes in to backstop the kind of a sliding economy so of course this is a situation it's very difficult to overdo what needs to be done,"" he said.
Binghamton Mayor Richard David said the $48.3 million the city is getting is a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity.
""The stimulus money can be used to offset your revenue losses and make your budget whole,"" David said.
In Rochester, Mayor Lovely Warren is working to close a $31.4 million gap before presenting her budget proposal in mid-May, but the city has yet to detail how it would use the $207 million from the stimulus to plug the gap and make other spending priorities.
Monroe County is has been hit by the drop in sales tax collections. So it is deciding how to prioritize $144 million from the stimulus package.
New aid, new debates
The relief comes on the heels of other COVID-19 relief packages from the federal government in 2020 that were much more restrictive about who received direct aid. The CARES Act last year earmarked $150 million to states and municipalities with populations of over 500,000.
Westchester County, the early pandemic epicenter in New York, was one of seven municipalities in the state that received direct aid from that plan.
With a $168 million boost the county had enough cash that it paid for meals for correction officers and funded a high school graduation in the parking lot of Playland, a county-owned amusement park closed due to the virus.
Westchester ended the year with a 2% reduction in property taxes and a projected $88 million surplus, due in large part to the aid.
The county is in line for another $187 million, and County Executive George Latimer said Westchester is likely to use its money for continued emergency and health service expenses.
It also may offer grants as it did last year for small business to purchase items such as heat lamps for outdoor dining or plastic dividers in retail stores.
The influx of cash will more than cover states and local government's pandemic-related losses, financial analyses said.
The Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, a fiscally conservative group, said the stimulus was equal to 116 times the amount of declining revenues for all state governments.
Nationwide, the analysis said local municipalities were set to get $130 billion, even though they did better in the first three quarters of 2020 compared the first three quarters of 2019.
That's true of New York government: Revenues were about $5 billion better than expected as the economy has come back quicker than originally estimated.
The foundation called proposals to infuse cash to local governments ""a solution in search of a problem.""
Gov. Andrew Cuomo and other political leaders have warned the money in many ways is a one-shot revenue source: Use to plug budget holes and you could end up with future gaps when the money dries up.
As a result, Robert Mujica said the state is eyeing ""one-time resources to fund one-time expenses that are specifically related to COVID and part of the recovery.""
Local leaders support new money, and why wouldn't they?
Municipal leaders said the stimulus will help maintain services and boost the economy as part of a widespread recovery. Tom Roach, mayor of White Plains, said he was expecting revenues to return to pre-pandemic levels quickly.
White Plains is a small city known as home to corporate office buildings and as a shopping and dining destination.
""We are a hub city and we punch above our weight in terms of economic impact so we employ a ton of people,"" Roach said. ""And we are a place for people to celebrate and have a good time and I think there's going to be a lot of that unleashed as the vaccinations continue.""
Senate Democrats passed the most recent stimulus without one vote from Republicans. Schumer said he had made municipal relief a priority.
""After fighting this pandemic on the frontlines, New York's counties and municipalities were loud and clear: they needed help and they needed it now to keep frontline workers on the job and prevent brutal service cuts,"" Schumer said in a statement.
During his roundtable discussion, Maloney pushed back on the criticism that the money is a bailout from Democrats.
""This isn't like it's going to a Democratic, blue state, even in New York,"" he said. ""Forty percent of the resources helping local government are going not to the state but to the locals, often controlled by Republicans.""
The funding can be used for sewer, broadband and other infrastructure work, but some government leaders said they'd use the funds just to steady their budgets. ""We still have a lot of work to do that we normally do as county executives,"" Orange County Executive Steve Neuhaus, a Republican, said during the roundtable. ""We run social services and all these different programs that have not gone away.""
There remains some confusion on one aspect of the stimulus, and that's the amounts going directly to villages.
Paul Feiner, the supervisor of Greenburgh, a Westchester town that has six villages within it, said less than $5 million of the $10 million it is getting would go to the town with the remaining earmarked for the villages.
""It would have been easier if the federal government had given the money directly to the villages but again, we're definitely grateful for this and appreciative and it's going to be a big help,"" Feiner said.

714,"
Citigroup Inc. said Wednesday its second-quarter profit soared thanks to an increasingly bright view of consumer health.
The bank posted a profit of $6.19 billion, or $2.85 per share, compared with $1.06 billion, or $0.38 per share a year earlier. That topped the $1.97 per share that analysts had expected, according to FactSet.
Revenue fell 12% to $17.47 billion. That still topped analysts' expectations of $17.22 billion.
""The pace of the global recovery is exceeding earlier expectations and with it, consumer and corporate confidence is rising,"" Chief Executive Jane Fraser said in a statement.
A year ago, Citigroup and other big banks were socking away funds to prepare for huge losses on loans to consumers and businesses. But those losses haven't materialized, and banks have been shrinking their rainy-day funds. In the second quarter, Citigroup freed up about $2.4 billion in loan-loss reserves, boosting its profit.
The switch particularly benefited Citigroup's global consumer bank. That unit swung to a profit of $1.83 billion compared with a loss a year ago. Consumer revenue fell 7%.
Spending on Citigroup-issued credit cards soared 40% from a year ago, during the depths of the Covid pandemic. It was also up 6% compared with the 2019 period, before the global pandemic. But banks' customers continue to pay off their credit cards at unusually high rates and interest rates remain low, squeezing lending profits.
Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told analysts the bank expects some credit-card debt to start growing as the stimulus rolls off in the second half of the year.
Net interest income, the amount the bank makes on loan interest minus what it pays on deposits, fell 8%.
In the institutional clients group, which includes investment banking and trading, profit more than doubled to $3.82 billion, while revenue fell 14%.
Trading revenue fell 33% from a record a year ago, when pandemic uncertainty made the markets particularly volatile. Fixed income trading plunged, but equity trading increased.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reported a 32% drop in second-quarter trading revenue, and JPMorgan Chase & Co. reported a 30% slide.
The deal-making hot streak that powered Goldman and JPMorgan also helped lift Citigroup's bankers. Fees for advising companies on mergers and acquisitions soared 77% while fees for underwriting stocks rose 11%. Fees for underwriting debt fell 21%.
Low rates also squeezed its core treasury and trade business that helps companies manage cash. Its revenue fell 1%.
Across the bank, expenses rose 7% to $11.19 billion. Analysts and investors have been anxious about Citigroup's costs increasing thanks to a regulatory order to revamp its vast risk-management systems.
Executives said the improving view on the economy convinced them to speed up some investments in the bank's wealth management unit and credit-card marketing, among other things. Mr. Mason said the bank now expects full-year expenses to rise about 5%, instead of 2% to 3% he had previously forecast.
""We're not going to miss this window of opportunity,"" he said.
Citigroup shares fell 0.3%. The stock has trailed big-bank peers and the broader stock market this year, rising 11% through Wednesday.

716,"
WASHINGTON -- Supply-chain disruptions and global health concerns spurred the International Monetary Fund to lower its 2021 growth forecast for the world economy, while the group raised its inflation outlook and warned of the risks of higher prices.
In the IMF's latest World Economic Outlook report, released Tuesday, economists cited the spread of the Covid-19 Delta variant and said the foremost policy priority is to vaccinate an adequate number of people in every country to prevent dangerous mutations of the virus. They stressed the importance for major economies to fulfill pledges to provide vaccines and financial support to international vaccination efforts before new variants knock a tenuous recovery off track.
""Policy choices have become more difficult . . . with limited room to maneuver,"" the IMF economists said in the report, which is released twice a year, along with two additional updates.
In raising its inflation outlook, the group urged policy makers to stand ready to take swift action if the recovery strengthens more quickly than expected or inflation risks become pronounced. Prices from food to medicine to vehicles have risen world-wide, threatening the global recovery after the pandemic wiped out businesses and jobs.
The IMF, a group made up of 190 member countries, promotes international financial stability and monetary cooperation. It also acts as a lender of last resort to countries in financial distress.
The IMF cut its global growth forecast for 2021 to 5.9% from 6% in its July report, a result of a reduction in its projection for advanced economies to 5.2% from 5.6%. The reduction mostly reflected problems with a global supply chain that caused a mismatch between supply and demand.
For emerging markets and developing economies, the outlook improved. Growth in these economies is pegged at 6.4% for 2021, up from an estimate of 6.3% in July. The uptick reflected stronger performances by some commodity-exporting countries amid rising energy prices.
The group maintained its view that global growth will moderate to 4.9% in 2022.
Among leading economics, the growth outlook for the U.S. was trimmed 0.1 percentage point to 6% this year, while the projection for China also was reduced by 0.1 percentage point to 8%. Several other major economies saw their outlook cut, including Germany, whose economy now is projected to grow 3.1% this year, down a half percentage point from its July forecast. Japan's outlook was lowered by 0.4 percentage point to 2.4%.
While the IMF maintains the view that inflation will return to pre-pandemic levels by mid-2022, it also warns that the negative impact of inflation could grow further, if the pandemic-related supply-chain disruptions turn out to be more damaging and long-lasting. That could result in earlier tightening of monetary policy by central banks, holding back the recovery.
IMF economists said that inflation outlook is ""highly uncertain"" because of the unprecedented nature of the current recovery. Despite the upward revision in its price projections, the forecast for inflation to return to pre-pandemic levels is based on an ample labor supply in advanced economies that should weigh on wages.
The IMF economists warn, however, that some factors could add persistent inflationary pressure. Among them: a shortage of housing boosting real-estate prices and rent ahead of new construction. Higher import prices of food and oil will also keep consumer prices elevated in emerging and developing countries. Prolonged supply disruptions, too, might push businesses to increase prices, leading to stronger demand for wage increases from workers.
""Should households, business and investors begin anticipating that price pressure from pent-up demand . . . to persist, there is a risk that medium-term inflation expectations could drift upward and lead to a self-fulfilling further rise in prices,"" IMF economists wrote. They added that, for now, there are ""no signs of such a shift.""
Supply shortages caused by logistical bottlenecks, combined with stimulus-fed consumer appetite for goods, have caused rapid increases in consumer prices in the U.S., Germany and many other nations, the IMF said.
Food-price increases have put particularly grave burdens on households from poorer nations. The IMF's food-and-beverage price index rose 11.1% between February and August, with prices of meat and coffee rising 30% and 29%, respectively.
The IMF now expects consumer-price inflation in advanced economies to reach 2.8% in 2021 and 2.3% in 2022, up from 2.4% and 2.1%, respectively, in its July report. Inflationary pressure is even more pronounced in emerging and developing economies, with consumer prices rising 5.5% this year and 4.9% next year.
""While monetary policy can generally look through transitory increases in inflation, central banks should be prepared to act quickly if the risks of rising inflation expectations become more material in this uncharted recovery,"" Gita Gopinath, IMF economic counselor and director of research, wrote in the report.
While the increases in commodity prices have bolstered some emerging and developing economies, many of the world's poorest countries have been left further behind, as they struggled to gain access to vaccines needed to open up their economies. More than 95% of people in lower-income nations remain unvaccinated, a contrast to the vaccination rate of nearly 60% in rich countries.

719,"Texas surpassed 2 million confirmed COVID-19 cases Wednesday, just two and a half months after reaching 1 million.
The state also added 467 fatalities to the virus death toll on Wednesday, a record.
The state's first confirmed COVID-19 case was reported in early March. It took more than eight months to reach 1 million confirmed cases, according to data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. State health officials reported 21,813 new cases Wednesday.
Coronavirus testing has significantly ramped up across the state, but experts estimate the number of actual cases in Texas and across the country is likely much higher. Many cases go untested and unreported.
Texas also began tracking ""probable cases"" for the first time in November, breaking the number out separately from the state's confirmed case count. The state defines probable cases as those that are determined by an FDA-approved rapid antigen test or a combination of symptoms and known exposure to someone with COVID-19.
An additional 289,597 probable cases have been reported since health officials began tracking the number on Nov. 4.
READ MORE: Have we reached the peak of the coronavirus pandemic in Texas? Here's what officials say.
With the new deaths reported Wednesday, the virus death toll in Texas has surpassed 35,000. Newly reported deaths each day likely occurred over a span of 10 days because death certificates must be filed within that time frame.
There were 12,795 patients hospitalized with the coronavirus in Texas on Tuesday, the latest data available. While the number has dropped over the last two weeks, health officials remain concerned that the number could tick up again if behaviors change along with the arrival of new, more contagious coronavirus variants.

720,"Publication: The BG News, , Bowling Green State University , Bolwing Green, OH—The COVID-19 pandemic and resulting nationwide K-12 school closures have created a social and economic impact that has paralyzed many communities. The lack of a proven technological solutions to help counter the impact of COVID in schools has compounded the crisis—but that can be fixed. 
Recently, two important developments have created an opportunity for a new national strategy to address the economic and health challenges facing schools, while equipping every classroom with healthy air filtration technology. 
The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 , recently signed into law, includes $54.3 billion to help K-12 public schools address the COVID-19 impact, with the goal of improving health and safety measures within these schools. Stand-alone air purification units for every classroom are the most efficient, scalable and cost-effective solution to reopen K-12 public schools safely, would require less than five percent of this relief funding, and can be deployed rapidly.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes that COVID-19 is transmitted via airborne particles, meaning filtration is critical. “Minimizing airborne viral load in the indoor school environment can help maintain and support the safe reopening of schools, benefiting not just the students and staff but, even more, their families and communities,” said Paul Scialla, founder and CEO of Delos and founder of the International WELL Building Institute. 
Based on many years of research, including ultra-fine particle filtration of indoor air and collaborations with organizations such as the Mayo Clinic and Cleveland Clinic, Delos has become the world leader in healthy buildings. Delos (www.delos.com) has deployed over 100,000 air filtration units into some of the country’s largest public school systems, including New York City, Chicago, Miami-Dade and Baltimore. As many schools’ HVAC systems are not designed to filter air particles as small as SARS-CoV-2, these portable units provide a scalable and cost-effective solution to help create safer environments across the nations’ six million K-12 public school classrooms—without requiring HVAC upgrades.
“When schools are closed, children lose access to critical support, food and safety, with the most vulnerable children paying the heaviest price. Committing to these upgrades for schools will cost a small fraction of what is allocated, and the positive impact will be transformational and permanent,” concluded Scialla. “We are here and ready to help school districts looking to make change in their communities with the funding they receive from CAA.”

721,"Oct. 18 - The number of COVID-19 patients in Maine hospitals has spiked again, climbing back over 200 less than two weeks after falling as low as 152.
Officials said the increase in hospitalizations is especially difficult because hospitals face challenges discharging patients who need to be moved to nursing homes or other long-term care facilities that don't have adequate staffing.
As of Monday, there were 201 individuals in Maine hospitals, including 68 in critical care and 31 on ventilators, according to data from the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. That's an increase of 32 hospitalizations just since Saturday.
The number of hospitalizations reached 235 in late September  -  the highest number since the pandemic began. By Oct. 7, the number had fallen to its lowest total since the peak of the delta variant surge, but it has been rising steadily since and spiked again in the past two days.
Since the pandemic reached Maine in March 2020, 2,655 individuals have been hospitalized at some point with COVID-19, and 1,095 people have died with the virus.
Most of the people hospitalized in Maine, and especially those in critical care, have been unvaccinated. Vaccinated patients who contract breakthrough cases of the virus and end up hospitalized often have an underlying condition that made them vulnerable to more severe illness.
Within the MaineHealth system, there were 64 people hospitalized on Monday, including 30 in critical care and 15 on ventilators. Among those in critical care, all but five were unvaccinated. Similarly, in Northern Light Health's system, 17 of 22 patients in the ICU with COVID-19 were unvaccinated.
Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association, said hospitals have been dealing with more than just an influx of COVID-19 patients.
""Much of our problem is throughput,"" he said. ""In other words, moving patients to their most appropriate care setting once they no longer need hospitalization.""
The ongoing workforce shortage in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities has led to many of them halting new admissions. Several nursing homes also have closed in recent weeks because of the staffing crisis, further reducing bed capacity around the state. That means patients preparing to be discharged from the hospital don't always have an immediate place to go.
""So as nursing homes cut back it has a direct impact on us so we not only have a COVID surge to contend with but we are as busy as we've ever been with non-COVID patients and we have these backups,"" Michaud said. ""It's a toxic soup.""
John Porter, spokesman for MaineHealth, said officials there are still trying to determine if recent hospitalizations are a sign of increased virus spread or if there are other factors at play, including whether there are difficulties with discharging patients.
Similarly, Karen Cashman, spokeswoman for Northern Light Health, said hospitals in their network are having a hard time with that.
""This is because of the decreasing number of those beds available in Maine due to a variety of reasons  -  including facility closure,"" she said. ""The result is some patients stay longer in hospitals than they need to simply because there is no skilled nursing bed to send them to. When appropriate and when it is safe to do so, we are also transitioning some patients back home with home-care physical therapy and occupational therapy support.""
The sudden increase in hospitalizations comes after new cases had fallen in recent weeks. The Maine CDC no longer releases new COVID-19 case data on Mondays, but, as of Saturday, the seven-day daily case average stood at 402. That's down from 607 cases on average two weeks earlier, although caseloads ticked up late last week, Maine's positivity rate also has been increasing. Two weeks ago, the seven-day average percentage of tests that came back positive was 4.3 percent. On Monday, it stood at 5.4 percent.
Across the country, cases, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 have been trending downward, but many areas still are seeing high levels of virus transmission. According to the U.S. CDC, hospitalizations are averaging 52,766 per day, which is down from more than 90,000 this time last month. The average number of new daily cases has been about 80,000, about half what it was in early September.
According to a tracker by the Washington Post, hospitalizations have declined nationwide by 8 percent in the last week, but 16 states saw increases. Maine and three other New England states are among the top five.
While Maine is among a minority of states seeing an increase over the past week, its rate of hospitalization  -  14 per 100,000 people  -  remains lower than 34 other states and lower than the national rate of 18 per 100,000.
Vaccinations, meanwhile, have picked up in Maine in recent weeks, a trend largely attributable to additional doses of the Pfizer vaccine for older individuals.
As of Monday, Maine has administered 894,984 final doses of either Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, or the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. That represents 66.6 percent of all Mainers and 75.6 percent of those 12 and older who are eligible.
The state also has now administered 61,546 third doses.
Federal officials are expected to rule soon on approving the Pfizer vaccine for children between 5-11. Additionally, boosters for the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines are under rev

722,"© Copyright 2021, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co. DES MOINES, Iowa – In a hypothetical 2024 rematch, former President Donald Trump leads President Joe Biden in Iowa by 11 percentage points, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.  In 2020, Trump defeated Biden by about 8 percentage points, carrying the state 53% to 45%. In the new survey, 51% of likely Iowa voters in the 2024 election would vote for Trump, a Republican, and 40% say they would vote for Biden, a Democrat. Another 4% say they would not vote for either candidate, and 5% say they are not sure. The poll comes as Biden’s approval rating among Iowans sits near its lowest since he took office in January. Meanwhile, Iowans view Trump more favorably than they did while he was in office, according to a September Iowa Poll.  More: How critical race theory went from conservative battle cry to mainstream powder keg Trump’s 2024 lead among likely Iowa voters appears to be driven by support among independents. Biden wins support among 95% of Democrats – slightly better than the 91% Trump earns among Republicans. But independents favor Trump by 8 percentage points, 45% to 37%. “Trump won Iowa convincingly in 2020, and that’s reflected in these data,” said pollster J. Ann Selzer, president of Selzer & Co. Selzer & Co. conducted the poll of 810 Iowa adults, including 658 likely voters, Nov. 7 to 10. The questions of all Iowans have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points, and questions asked of likely voters have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. But Selzer cautioned that the poll shows an opening for Republican caucus challengers. “If all you had in this poll was that Trump would defeat Joe Biden by 11 points, it might say everything is locked up,” she said. But the poll found that among Iowans who identify as Republicans, 61% say they are more aligned with the party compared with 26% who say they are more aligned with Trump. The margin of error for that question is plus or minus 6 percentage points. Jan. 6 riot: Trump said it was 'common sense' for Capitol rioters to chant 'Hang Mike Pence' That preference for the party over Trump is shared by a majority of every demographic group among Republicans, including those in rural areas and evangelical Iowans – two of Trump’s strongholds. “It opens the door a bit for Iowa,” Selzer said. A parade of potential Republican presidential contenders already has made its way through the state during the past year, more than two years ahead of Iowa’s first-in-the-nation Republican caucuses. “If I had a choice between Gov. (Ron) DeSantis or Donald Trump, that right there would be a hard decision for me,” said Franklin Troy Hommer, a poll respondent from Marion County and political independent. “But if you’re telling me that my two choices are Joe Biden or Donald Trump, I’m picking Donald Trump.” Trump leads with rural, evangelical Iowans  Neither Trump nor Biden has made a formal reelection announcement, though both have left the option open. Trump, 75, visited Des Moines in October, holding a rally that drew thousands to the Iowa State Fairgrounds amid speculation he was laying groundwork for another White House run.  Biden, 78, is just ending the first year of his first term. At a news conference in March, Biden said he planned to run for reelection but also said he was a ""great respecter of fate"" and has never planned anything for certain. He has not returned to the state since campaigning there ahead of the 2020 election. In the hypothetical matchup, Trump leads with huge margins among evangelical and rural Iowans. He carries evangelical likely voters 76% to 15%, and he carries rural likely voters 64% to 26%. Justin Lindsey, 36, a poll respondent from Sioux City, said he’d vote for Trump in a hypothetical rematch with Biden. He said Trump put in place policies that worked. “The reason is: He is more of a businessman than a politician,” said Lindsey, a carpenter and a registered Republican. “When he got into office, he actually ran the country like a business, and he’s had great success with businesses.” More: Mike Pence sought advice from former VP Dan Quayle on how to deal with Trump, book says Trump also does well among likely voters without a college degree, earning support among 59% compared with Biden’s 31%. Biden does better with those who have earned a college degree, 53% to Trump’s 38%. Biden also does well among likely voters 65 and older – 52% to 41% – and those with no religious affiliation – 56% to 36%. Elizabeth McRae, 22, a respondent from Cedar Falls, said she believes “four more years of Trump would destroy the country.” McRae, a University of Northern Iowa student and a Democrat, said she approves of the job Biden is doing as president. “I feel like he is really holding the country steady at a point in time where we’re going to look back and think, ‘How the hell did anybody do that?’” she said. But she wishes Biden and the Democratic majorities in Congress would go beyond the status quo.  “I think it’s a little bit of a shame that we’re not pushing a little bit more of progressive policies while we have the power,” she said. Biden’s overall job approval stagnates, but COVID-19 approval ticks up Biden’s approval ratings have plummeted since taking office. Iowans disapprove of the job he's doing as president by about a 2-to-1 margin. Biden’s job approval has not been in net positive territory in Iowa since March. Then, 47% of Iowans approved of his performance and 44% disapproved. Today, one-third of all Iowa adults, 33%, say they approve of the job Biden is doing, up 2 percentage points from the Register’s last Iowa Poll, in September; 62% disapprove; and 6% are not sure. “This is not a good approval rating by any definition,” Selzer said. Biden is rated poorly for his handling of a range of issues. Fewer than one-third of all Iowans approve of his handling of immigration, criminal justice, the economy and the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. On those specific issues:  Twenty-four percent of Iowans approve of the way Biden is handling immigration. Another 66% disapprove and 10% are not sure. Among Democrats, a minority approve, 47%. On criminal justice, 28% of Iowans approve, 53% disapprove and 19% are not sure. Among Democrats, 60% approve. Iowans continue to rate Biden poorly on his handling of Afghanistan after overseeing the U.S. military’s withdrawal from the country, relinquishing control to the Taliban. Today, 22% approve, 68% disapprove and 9% are not sure – his worst metric among issues tested. Among Democrats, a minority approve, 49%. Thirty-two percent of Iowans approve of Biden’s handling of the economy and 61% disapprove. Another 7% are unsure. But Democrats give him a 77% approval rating on the economy. Hommer, a truck driver, said he’s spending significantly more to fuel up when he goes to the pump. He blames Biden for rising fuel prices after the president halted construction of the Keystone XL pipeline and tried, unsuccessfully, to pause new oil and gas drilling on federal lands. “Everything’s gone up, so I almost can’t afford to live,” he said. The one policy area where Biden’s approval has improved slightly is his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, 41% of Iowans say they approve, while 57% say they disapprove. In September, 36% approved and 60% disapproved.  Kathy Seward, 66, a Democratic poll respondent from West Des Moines, said she likes that Biden is “taking a stand” on COVID-19 and said his actions show he has backbone. “I like that he was trying to get all the employers to require vaccinations or testing,” said Seward, a retired clerical worker. “Again, it’s the only way we’re going to get this under control.” Iowans broadly feel the nation is headed in the wrong direction. More than two-thirds, 69%, say things in the nation are on the wrong track. Twenty-three percent say things are headed in the right direction, a rise of 2 percentage points from September. About this poll  The Iowa Poll, conducted Nov. 7-10, 2021, for the Des Moines Register and Mediacom by Selzer & Co. of Des Moines, is based on telephone interviews with 810 Iowans ages 18 and older. Interviewers with Quantel Research contacted households with randomly selected landline and cellphone numbers supplied by Dynata. Interviews were administered in English. Responses were adjusted by age, sex, and congressional district to reflect the general population based on recent American Community Survey estimates.  Questions based on the sample of 810 Iowa adults have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points. Questions based on the subsample of 658 likely voters in the 2024 presidential election have a maximum margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. This means that if this survey were repeated using the same questions and the same methodology, 19 times out of 20, the findings would not vary from the true population value by more than plus or minus 3.4 percentage points or 3.8 percentage points, respectively. Results based on smaller samples of respondents – such as by gender or age – have a larger margin of error.

724,"In Brevard County, the COVID-19 positivity rate dropped from 12% to 8% between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23. Florida Department of Health-Brevard officials cautioned that while the downward trend is a positive sign, Brevard County remains a high transmission community.
Maria Stahl, administrator for the Florida DOH in Brevard, said at the county's weekly COVID-19 briefing that she'd like to see the case positivity rate be sustained at less than 5% and the weekly cases drop below 100 cases per 100,000 people for a sustained period.
According to the latest COVID-19 report released Friday by Florida DOH, Brevard County had 199 new cases per 100,000 in the last week. That's still 99 cases over the rate Stahl said she'd like to see.
At an 8.6% new case positivity rate and 256.3 new weekly cases per 100,000 people, Florida is still considered a high community transmission state, based on data released by the CDC.
The CDC considers a community to have high transmission rates when there have been 100 or more new cases per 100,000 in a week. High transmission communities lead to an increase in K-12 cases, COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19-related deaths, according to the CDC.
Between Sept. 4 and Sept. 18, Brevard County had 152 more COVID-19 deaths — averaging about 11 deaths a day. There have been 1,474 COVID-19-related deaths in Brevard County as of Sept. 18. After Sept. 18, county-level death data was not provided in either the state's report nor the CDC's provisional data report.
The state of Florida had 2,340 new COVID-19 related deaths between Sept. 17 and Sept. 23. Florida has had a total of 53,580 COVID-19-related deaths since the start of the pandemic.
As of Sept. 20, there were 217 COVID-19-related hospitalizations in Brevard County, of which 94% were unvaccinated, according to a Facebook post from the Brevard County Emergency Management Office.
Health First's four hospitals had 119 COVID-19-positive inpatients as of Sept. 22; 95.8% were unvaccinated.
Steward Health Care's chief medical officer for Florida, Dr. Eric Deppert, emphasized the importance of getting vaccinated to stave off COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.
""We've had a number of patients that want to be, to be vaccinated once hospitalized or regretted the decision"" to not get vaccinated, he said.
Yet, in Brevard County, only 67% of the eligible population, those 12 and older, was vaccinated as of Sept. 23. That's only an increase of one percentage point from the week prior.
Of the eligible population in Florida, age group vaccination rates across the state are:
Ages 12-19 are 54% vaccinated.
Ages 20-29 are 52% vaccinated.
Ages 30-39 are 62% vaccinated.
Ages 40-49 are 70% vaccinated.
Ages 50-59 are 76% vaccinated.
Ages 60-64 are 83% vaccinated.
Ages 65+ are 88% vaccinated.
Of those fully vaccinated in Florida, 3% have received a booster shot.
Based on data released by the CDC, 64.3% of the eligible population is vaccinated.
There have been 42,501,643 COVID-19 cases and 680,688 COVID-19-related deaths nationwide since the start of the pandemic in 2020.
Where to get vaccinated
Florida Department of Health is offering COVID-19 vaccines at three sites:
Melbourne clinic, 601 E. University Blvd., open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays.
Titusville clinic, 611 N. Singleton Ave., open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays.
Viera clinic, 2555 Judge Fran Jamieson Way, open 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. weekdays.
The Department of Health is offering vaccination outreach events at community sites. The next event is at the location below and will offer the Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer vaccines:
Oct. 9: New Shiloh Christian Center Church,3900 Sarno Road, Melbourne, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
COVID-19 vaccines also are available at pharmacies at various local CVS, Publix, Sam's Club, Walgreens, Walmart and Winn-Dixie stores, as well as urgent-care centers and physician offices.
The website www.211Brevard.org has a list of medical facilities and businesses offering vaccines. Some of those sites require reservations, while others allow walk-ins.

727,"A cease-fire between Israel and Hamas took effect Thursday evening after both parties agreed to halt an 11-day military confrontation that left hundreds dead and sparked international alarm.  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the truce, brokered by Egyptian officials. after a unanimous vote by his cabinet to end the assault against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. Taher Nounou, a Hamas official, confirmed the deal: “The Palestinian resistance will commit itself to this deal as long as the occupation is committed,” he said.  The development followed growing U.S. and international pressure on Israel to call off a military operation that pounded the Gaza Strip with airstrikes. Hamas fired rockets indiscriminately into civilian areas in Israel. At least 230 Palestinians, including 65 children were killed, and 12 Israelis, including two children. ""These hostilities have resulted in the tragic deaths of so many civilians,"" President Joe Biden said at the White House after the cease-fire was announced. He hailed the truce and credited the Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi for his role in brokering the deal.  ""We remain committed to working with the United Nations and other international stakeholders to provide rapid humanitarian assistance ... for the people of Gaza,"" he said, adding that the U.S. would also help with reconstruction efforts in coordination with other countries. Israel described the truce as ""mutual and unconditional."" The ceasefire took effect at 2 a.m. Friday morning local time, 7 p.m. ET. But hostilities between the two sides remained high. Even as the cease-fire was confirmed, Israel's Defense Forces said sirens alerting Israeli residents of Hamas rocket fire were sounding in the south of the country.  The UN's Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the next step would be to ""stabilize the cease-fire"" and launch a ""swift, sustainable reconstruction and recovery"" effort in Gaza.  ""I stress that Israeli and Palestinian leaders have a responsibility beyond the restoration of calm to start a serious dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict,"" Guterres said. The agreement for a truce came a day after Biden pressed Netanyahu to de-escalate the conflict and move toward a cease-fire. Biden's appeal to Netanyahu reportedly strengthened Egypt's efforts to negotiate a ceasefire.  Biden quietly ramped up pressure on Israel in recent days as he faced mounting international alarm over the rising death toll and growing demands from some Democrats in Congress for a cease-fire or a reduction in aid to Israel. In his remarks Thursday, Biden said the cease-fire deal opened an opportunity to seek a broader peace agreement amid the parties.  ""My administration will continue our quiet, relentless diplomacy toward that end,"" he said. I believe we have a genuine opportunity to make progress and I'm committed to working for it."" But the president reiterated his staunch support for Israel's campaign against Hamas, which the U.S. considers a terrorist group.  Biden said he spoke with Netanyahu after the cease-fire was reached, and in the conversation, the Israeli leader expressed ""his appreciation for the Iron Dome system, which our nations developed together and which has saved the lives of countless Israeli citizens, both Arab and Jew."" Biden said he assured Netanyahu of his ""full support"" to replenish the Iron Dome system and ensure Israel's ability to defend itself against future attacks.  The State Department said Biden's top diplomat, Antony Blinken, would travel to the region ""in the coming days"" to discuss recovery efforts.  The violence wreaked far more devastation in Gaza than in Israel, with an estimated 58,000 Palestinians displaced from their homes and untold damage to the territory's infrastructure, which was already dilapidated by a 14-year blockade.  Israeli attacks damaged at least 18 hospitals and clinics and destroyed one health facility, according to the World Health Organization. WHO officials also said the central COVID-19 testing lab in Gaza City was almost totally destroyed, and the violence caused “severe restrictions” on the delivery of medical supplies. In Gaza City, which has borne the brunt of Israel's military assault, Ali Al-Gharably said that conditions are extremely difficult for families such as his.  The 36-year-old said he fled his home a week ago with his children because of Israeli artillery fire and they have since been living temporarily in a school.  ""The UN brought us some food and water but we left our home with nothing. We hope the war ends soon so we can go back home,"" he said. ""My children don't even have enough clothes to wear. We didn't even have time to put on our shoes."" The fighting between Israel and Hamas began after the militant group fired rockets toward Jerusalem after days of clashes between Palestinian protesters and Israeli police. Among the triggers for the violence: an effort by Jewish settlers to evict Palestinian families from their homes in East Jerusalem, followed by confrontations between Israeli police and Palestinian protesters near at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, a site sacred to Jews and Muslims.  Hamas, which controls Gaza, fired thousands of rockets at civilian targets in Israel. The stream of rocket shower sent many Israelis scrambling to safety in bomb shelters, although the vast majority of the weapons were intercepted by Israel's sophisticated Iron Dome missile defense system.  Israel responded with its own fusillade of missiles aimed at degrading Hamas' military capability and killing its leaders. Gaza is home to approximately two million Palestinians.  Dennis Ross, a former Middle East envoy under President Bill Clinton, told The Jerusalem Post, that he didn't expect a cease-fire to last for long and that any agreement would effectively be ""short-term calm"" while Hamas still controls Gaza. Ross urged the international community to link humanitarian aid to Hamas demilitarization.

729,"Visa delays are causing tumult in the classical music industry, leading to a wave of cancellations just as live performances are finally returning.When the Seattle Symphony finally performed before a full audience last month for the first time in a year and half, something was missing: its music director, the Danish conductor Thomas Dausgaard, who could not get a visa to travel to the United States.The New York Philharmonic had to find a last-minute substitute this week for the esteemed Norwegian pianist Leif Ove Andsnes, who could not get a visa, either. The Metropolitan Opera had to replace two Russian singers in its production of ""Boris Godunov."" And the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, a British chamber orchestra that has been regularly visiting the United States since 1980, had to abandon a 10-city tour.As the easing of coronavirus restrictions has allowed live performance to return, many cultural organizations are struggling with another problem: their inability to get artists into the United States because of a long backlog of visa applications at American embassies and consulates. The delays have hampered many industries, but they are particularly upending classical music, which relies on stars from all over the world to make a circuit of leading concert halls and opera houses.Many artists have been caught in the middle, forced to dip into savings to make up for lost concert fees and scrambling to fill their schedules.""It's like training for the Olympic Games for four years and then at the last minute learning you cannot compete,"" said Arthur Jussen, a Dutch pianist whose engagements with the Boston Symphony Orchestra were canceled this month because of what the orchestra described as ""unprecedented delays"" in getting his visa, just weeks after a 14-concert tour in China, with his brother Lucas, fell through. ""It is a bitter pill to swallow.""The classical touring industry was one of the first sectors hit by the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020, and now it may be one of the last to recover. Dozens of performances have been canceled in recent weeks in China, Australia, Japan and other countries with sweeping travel restrictions and quarantine rules. The pandemic has served to deepen concerns about the viability of global tours, which have long been considered an essential but expensive part of the classical music ecosystem.But some of the most acute problems are surfacing in the United States.While the Biden administration plans to lift a pandemic-era ban on travelers from 33 countries next month -- allowing fully vaccinated visitors from the European Union, China, Iran, South Africa, Brazil, India and other countries -- the backlog of visa applications remains a problem.Even in normal times, it can be difficult for visiting artists to obtain the visas they need to perform in the United States. Now they face even longer lines and staff shortages at American embassies and consulates around the world. The earliest available appointments for visa interviews in some cities are for next spring, months after some artists have scheduled performances.The government has allowed exceptions to the travel ban, which remains in effect until early November, for visitors who can prove their work is essential to the U.S. economy. But consulates have in recent weeks been flooded with such requests, adding to the pileup. And some fear the lifting of the travel ban could yield more visa requests -- and more delays.The State Department, in response to questions about the delays, said the pandemic had resulted in ""profound reductions"" in its ability to process visas. ""As the global situation evolves, the department seeks ways to safely and efficiently process visa applications around the world,"" the department said in a statement.In the United States, the visa woes are injecting uncertainty into a fall season that was already rife with challenges, including tepid ticket sales and the ongoing threat posed by the Delta variant.Arts groups are calling on the government to fast-track visas.""The overarching concern is that it would have a chilling effect on international cultural activity and everything it has to offer,"" said Heather Noonan, vice president for advocacy at the League of American Orchestras. ""When arts organizations can't rely on the process to work, it makes it very expensive and somewhat risky.""The problems have dampened some of the reopening festivities. For months the Seattle Symphony had promoted the return of its music director, Mr. Dausgaard, who had been stuck abroad since March 2020, for its opening night gala. But he was forced to cancel at the last minute because of visa issues.Mr. Dausgaard, who is now on track to get his visa so he can travel next month, said that the restrictions had meant that he and the orchestra had missed opportunities to develop, including by performing new works together.""It is super painful to see ideas, not least those ideas connected to recordings or touring or something bigger than a single concert, go away,"" he said. ""The most painful part is the lack of contact with the musicians.""Even some of the industry's biggest stars have been affected by the delays, including Lang Lang, the celebrated Chinese pianist, whose visa to enter the United States for concerts last month came through only at the last minute.In an interview, Mr. Lang said he hoped restrictions around the world would eventually be lifted so that touring could resume in force.""It is essential to show our audiences that concerts are back,"" he said. ""The world needs live music.""Outside the United States, the obstacles for touring artists are also formidable.China, once a bustling, lucrative market for touring, including for many American orchestras, has also remained closed to most foreigners, including performers.Wray Armstrong, who runs a music agency in Beijing, said many ensembles cannot afford the time and money spent on quarantines, even if they are able to get visas. ""We just have to be patient until the rules change,"" he said.China's strict quarantine rules, which require isolation of up to three weeks for anyone entering the country, have had the effect of dissuading many Chinese artists from traveling. The composer and conductor Tan Dun has canceled nearly all appearances outside China since the start of the pandemic, delaying the premiere of several works, including ""Requiem for Nature,"" which he was to conduct in Amsterdam next month.Travel restrictions have added to pressures on many orchestras, which have traditionally depended on tours for branding and prestige. The pandemic has prompted many to cancel plans to travel overseas or to consider scaling back; some larger orchestras are considering sending smaller ensembles instead.Zubin Mehta, the renowned conductor, said it was important for American orchestras to maintain robust touring schedules so that they can develop and show off the strength of music in the United States internationally.""An orchestra always comes back from a major tour a better orchestra,"" he said. ""A great American orchestra playing in Berlin getting a standing ovation is a reflection on America.""For artists dealing with delays gaining entry to the United States, the experience has been trying.Stephen Stirling, principal horn for the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields, said the ensemble's fall tour would have helped him offset some of the thousands of dollars he has lost in fees when he was unable to perform during the pandemic.Mr. Stirling said it was jarring to be dealing with travel restrictions at a time when many cultural institutions are reopening across the world.""Most people's business is picking up, but we're still getting cancellations,"" he said. ""The sooner things can return to normal, the better. We're desperate to tour again.""""The most painful part is the lack of contact with the musicians,"" said the Danish conductor Thomas Dausgaard, above.

733,"With elections looming and another coronavirus surge underway, Illinois lawmakers are due to return to Springfield Wednesday with the goal of crafting next year's state budget and wrapping up much of their other work for the year by early April -- nearly two months ahead of the usual schedule. Whether the Democratic-controlled legislature will be able to meet that deadline remains to be seen, as the skyrocketing number of COVID-19 cases forced the General Assembly to cancel the other session days during the first week of the new year and likely the entire second week. But with primaries set for June 28 and all 177 seats in the Illinois House and Senate up for election in 2022, lawmakers will be eager to avoid controversial issues and get back home to campaign.But even as Democrats seek to strengthen their hold on the legislature and keep Gov. J.B. Pritzker in office for a second term, they'll also be looking to strengthen their case to voters that they've delivered on important issues, from stabilizing state finances to keeping the public safe during a pandemic.Republicans will be looking to emphasize issues such as rising crime and sky-high property taxes to convince voters -- particularly in the suburbs -- that they should give them a greater voice in Springfield. Cutting into the Democrats' dominance will be no easy task, however, with a new district map drawn by Democrats designed to preserve the majority party's power.If lawmakers finish by April 8 as scheduled, it would be the earliest the General Assembly has adjourned since the 1970 state constitution took effect. The earliest conclusions since then have been April 15 in 2000 and May 4 in 2006 -- both also election years like 2022.House Speaker Emanuel ""Chris"" Welch of Hillside, who along with Senate President Don Harmon of Oak Park controls the legislative calendar, says the schedule for the upcoming spring session is not shortened but condensed. Lawmakers were originally slated to be at the Capitol for roughly the same number of days as in a typical year, but it's unclear if that will happen with the big surge in COVID-19 cases.And as always, the foremost task before lawmakers will be approving a state spending plan for the budget year that begins July 1.""We want to continue down that path of financial stability, and so the budget is going to be a real top priority for us as we head back,"" Welch said.Here's a look at the tasks facing lawmakers in Springfield in 2022.Balancing the budgetDespite coronavirus-induced economic uncertainty and voters' resounding rejection of Pritzker's graduated-rate income tax proposal in 2020, the state's finances have seen modest improvement in the three years since the Democratic governor took office.The state got its first credit rating upgrades in decades in 2021, and its backlog of unpaid bills has shrunk significantly, to the point where vendors are typically paid within a normal 30-day cycle.What's more, the state's massive unfunded pension liability decreased, if only by a tiny amount, for just the second time in a decade, dropping to $139.9 billion the fiscal year that ended June 30 from $141 billion the previous year. The decrease was due largely to annual investment returns of more than 20% across the state's five retirement systems, far above expectations.During a recent downtown Chicago news conference to discuss the state's latest efforts to combat COVID-19, Pritzker said he was focused on one goal for the upcoming session.""I have one priority every session that is the No. 1 priority, and that's balancing our budget, making sure that we're doing the right thing to put our state on firm fiscal footing, to continue to get credit upgrades as we have, and to make sure that we're providing the services that people need,"" he told reporters at the James R. Thompson Center.But with the omicron variant driving a fifth surge of the pandemic in Illinois and inflation driving up prices, maintaining progress on the financial front figures to be a major challenge.One significant problem: The state's $4.5 billion debt to the federal unemployment insurance trust fund, which is racking up interest at a rate of 2.27%. State Comptroller Susana Mendoza has asked the U.S. Treasury Department to pause the interest, but there's no guarantee that will happen.Another question facing lawmakers is how to spend the roughly $3.6 billion the state has left from the $8.1 billion it received from President Joe Biden's American Rescue Plan coronavirus relief package.With three years remaining to budget the funds, ""we will not spend it all in 2022,"" Welch said.""What's going on right now in our world today is a stark reminder that the pandemic is not behind us,"" he said. ""And as policymakers, we have to have that top of mind as we head into another budget season.""Acknowledging some improvement in the state's finances, House Republican Leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs said Pritzker and the Democrats should not take the influx of federal funds for granted.""At some point that money is going to run out,"" Durkin said. ""So, I would hope that the governor would not increase spending nor the Democrats increase spending, because at some point we're going to run out of this extra money that's sitting in the wallet.""Durkin said he would like to see some of the relief money used toward paying the deficit in the unemployment trust fund.""Our businesses are the ones who've suffered the most. Small, large, but mainly the small guys,"" he said. ""My gosh, I can't believe that we haven't gone far enough to say that, 'You know what, we're going to start dedicating money from (the federal government) to start to reduce our reliability in the (unemployment) trust fund.' ""Harmon said the unemployment fund was ""strained beyond imagination by the pandemic,"" but remedying that with money from Washington should be part of a well-thought-out plan.Taking on high property taxesHigh property taxes, driven largely by the relatively low level of state funding for public schools, continues to be one of the most vexing problems for state lawmakers.After using the possibility of easing the tax burden on homeowners as a selling point in his failed pitch for the graduated income tax, Pritzker hasn't made the issue a top legislative priority. A legislative task force that was supposed to study the issue and make recommendations devolved into partisan squabbling in late 2019 and never finished its work.""Property taxes remain a priority for voters, so I think as we approach the spring session, there's probably some ideas that are floating around (about what) we can do to provide more equity in the property tax system,"" said Democratic Rep. Mike Zalewski of Riverside, chairman of the House Revenue and Finance Committee. ""Until we get down (to Springfield) and (I) talk to my colleagues, it's hard to say exactly what those are. But property taxes remain a top priority. ""Different parts of the state face different challenges, from assessment issues in Lake County and the Loop to declining property values and a declining industrial base elsewhere, Zalewski said.""All those things add up to sort of people wanting to sort of revisit a lot of what makes up the property tax code,"" he said. ""We're open-minded. And we'll start having hearings in January and February to see what we can do to be responsive.""Durkin alluded to news that he thinks should be a wake-up call to the legislature: The village of Niles on Dec. 14 imposed an 88% property tax levy for next year, a move that one Niles official called a ""difficult"" but necessary action to more adequately fund police and fire pensions, village road construction and deferred capital projects.""If there is a time for us to really address property taxes, we saw it right now,"" Durkin said. ""It's a difficult system, but I would hope that we've seen enough examples over the past two years where we have to make a decision on how we need to reform the property tax system in Cook County, at least, if not the state of Illinois.""Addressing crimeEven as Pritzker has made his pandemic response central to his campaign, he touched on the seriousness of rising crime rates when he signed an executive order in November declaring gun violence a public health crisis. The order directs $250 million over the next three years to implement a new data-driven plan to ""reimagine public safety"" as part of a holistic community-based violence prevention initiative.Public safety has become a central theme for Republicans, who are trying to brand Democrats as failures in addressing that issue in the upcoming election. GOP lawmakers continue to criticize sweeping criminal justice reform legislation signed by Pritzker in early 2021 that allows, among other things, citizens to file anonymous complaints against cops and will eventually put an end to cash bail. Republicans say those provisions weaken law enforcement and embolden criminals.Durkin and other Republicans have pushed proposals that include funding to hire additional police officers, stiffer penalties for gun crimes and tougher punishments for those who commit organized retail theft offenses such as smash-and-grab burglaries.Durkin acknowledged he isn't confident any of these measures will see the light of day in the upcoming legislative session.""The Democrats will look at that as some type of admission that they've done the wrong thing, and then they have compromised public safety,"" Durkin said. ""They have kept us out of the loop over the past two years. I'm not expecting anything from them at all, for them to work with us and give us any opportunity to negotiate with them.""Senate GOP leader Dan McConchie of Hawthorn Woods expressed similar frustrations with his caucus's superminority role, noting that members introduced several anti-crime proposals in the fall that were ignored by Democrats.""At the end of the day, the biggest question is whether we're going to have robust debate in an election year on key issues that the public seems concerned about,"" McConchie said.Harmon said one of the session's tasks could be ensuring that bills passed during the previous session and signed into law are being executed properly. This could include elements of the criminal justice legislation that are either already in effect or are scheduled to go into effect at a future date, such as the end of cash bail.He defended the sweeping legislation for addressing the ""shortcomings of the criminal justice system"" in being unfair to people based on ""who they were and where they were from.""""I don't know anybody in the General Assembly who doesn't think violent criminals ... shouldn't be held to account for their actions,"" said Harmon.If Republicans are looking to place blame for rising crime, Welch said, they should consider the damage that was done to social services during the legislature's long-running budget standoff during the tenure of GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner.""Let's remind people that Bruce Rauner and Jim Durkin and Republicans in this state tore apart our safety net programs and our infrastructure that was fighting crime across the state, and they remained silent for 736 days during a budget impasse, and we are still paying the price today,"" he said.Democrats have put forward an agenda that ""includes making sure that our police are properly funded, equipped and trained to properly respond and prevent violence without discriminating against communities"" as well as ""a long-term, comprehensive, well-funded plan to address the root causes of violence,"" Welch said.Selecting a legislative watchdogPerhaps the most immediate concern facing lawmakers is choosing a new person to serve as the legislature's top watchdog.Legislative Inspector General Carol Pope announced her resignation in the summer in response to an overhaul of state government ethics laws that she said ""demonstrated true ethics reform is not a priority."" She was supposed to leave office Dec. 15, but agreed to extend her tenure through Jan. 6 after Democrats and Republicans on the bipartisan Legislative Ethics Commission deadlocked on the selection of a new inspector general.Republicans on the panel are backing Joseph Hartzler, a former assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted convicted Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh and was recommended by a search committee. Democrats favor David Risley, also a former federal prosecutor, who was director of public safety policy for Rauner, according to a letter to the four top legislative leaders from GOP Sen. Jil Tracy of Quincy, who chairs the ethics commission. Risley was not recommended by the search committee.If no replacement is named by Thursday, it wouldn't be the first time the legislature has gone without a watchdog.After the state's first legislative inspector general resigned in 2014, the position went unfilled until the vacancy was thrust into the spotlight when a victims' rights advocate testified at a legislative hearing in October 2017 that her complaint alleging she'd been sexually harassed by a state senator went unanswered for more than a year.The blowback led to the temporary appointment of former federal prosecutor Julie Porter, who held the position until Pope, a former state prosecutor and appellate judge, took over in March 2019.----------dpetrella@chicagotribune.comjgorner@chicagotribune.comCAPTION: Photo: Illinois Senate President Don Harmon, D-Oak Park, gives closing remarks on the floor of the Senate at the Illinois Capitol in Springfield on Sept. 13.

736,"Targeted News ServiceWASHINGTON, Aug. 5 -- Peter J. Nelson, senior policy fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, Golden Valley, Minnesota, has issued a public comment on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services proposed rule entitled ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act: Updating Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations, and Improving Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond Proposed Rule"". The comment was written on July 28, 2021, and posted on July 29, 2021:* * *Thank you for the opportunity to provide comments on the proposals included in the ""Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Updating Payment Parameters, Section 1332 Waiver Implementing Regulations, and Improving Health Insurance Markets for 2022 and Beyond Proposed Rule."" As a state-based public policy organization in Minnesota, Center of the American Experiment has a particular interest in how this rule will impact a state's flexibility to address unique challenges facing its insurance markets under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA). Overall, we hold strong concerns that the proposed rule will substantially limit state flexibility, harm insurance market risk pools, and result in higher, less affordable premiums.Navigator Program StandardsThe ACA requires an Exchange to establish a Navigator program./1At a minimum, the ACA requires a Navigator to perform five duties: conduct public education activities on the availability of qualified health plans (QHPs); distribute fair and impartial information on enrollment in QHPs and the availability of premium and cost sharing subsidies; facilitate enrollment in QHPs; provide referrals for enrollees with a grievance, complaint, or question regarding their health plan or coverage; and provide information in a manner that is culturally and linguistically appropriate for the population served by the Exchange./2On top of these statutory duties, CMS proposes to reinstitute a requirement that Navigators in the Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs) provide information and assistance with regard to certain post-enrollment topics. We oppose this policy change because it would add an unnecessary requirement on Navigators when they already struggle to perform their basic statutory duties, and would put consumers at higher risk of receiving poor information.Adds an Unnecessary, Counterproductive RequirementIn the 2020 Payment Notice, CMS removed requirements on Navigators to provide certain post-enrollment assistance and, instead, made this assistance optional./3At the time, CMS recognized this post-enrollment assistance was not among the Navigator duties required in statute./4While CMS originally put this requirement in place to strengthen consumer assistance, CMS concluded the requirement added an unnecessary regulatory burden on Navigators that ultimately limited their flexibility to design a program that best meets the needs of consumers.The Navigator program has been a controversial element of the ACA. Agents and brokers have complained that Navigators are basically a free government competitor that crowds out their services and fails to deliver the same level of service consumers need to truly navigate the insurance market./5Navigators have also been criticized as being less about health care and more about supporting a progressive political infrastructure to build influence./6In addition, since the Exchange began operations, Navigators have struggled to perform their core statutory duty to facilitate enrollment in QHPs. Data from CMS show Navigators have historically enrolled only a tiny portion of consumers through the FFE, responsible for just 83,495 FFE enrollments for plan year 2017 (less than one percent of plan selections for the 2017 OEP) even with $63 million in funding./7This level of performance created legitimate questions over how Navigators were using federal funding.Considering ongoing concerns over the appropriate role and effectiveness of Navigators, CMS should exercise careful oversight over the Navigator program to ensure Navigators are effectively meeting their core statutory duties before CMS adds new non-core duties. Without any evidence that Navigators are adequately meeting their statutory duties, it would be counterproductive to add additional duties at this time. Maintaining post-enrollment assistance as an option helps ensure Navigators can focus on meeting their statutory duties.Maintaining post-enrollment assistance as an option also provides important flexibility on how Navigators allocate federal resources to carry out their statutory duties. For example, under current rules Navigators in communities with robust post-enrollment assistance through other avenues may reasonably decide to focus their resources upfront on enrollment assistance. Other Navigators may find post-enrollment assistance lacking in their communities and determine they are best positioned to fill this need. Current regulations give Navigators the flexibility to determine how best to serve their communities and consumers. Reinstituting post-enrollment assistance as a requirement would undermine this flexibility.Moving forward, we recommend that CMS increases oversight over Navigators to ensure they are effectively performing their core statutory duties, especially in light of the substantial boost in funding recently announced.Puts Consumers at RiskThe proposed requirement to provide post-enrollment assistance puts consumers at risk of receiving poor information from a Navigator. The statute requires Navigators to provide referrals ""for any enrollee with a grievance, complaint, or question regarding their health plan, coverage, or a determination under such plan or coverage.""/8While CMS cites to this duty as evidence suggesting Congress anticipated the need for post-enrollment assistance from Navigators, the statutory provision is more appropriately read to suggest that Congress understood the limited expertise of a Navigator.By requiring Navigators to provide assistance beyond a referral, the requirement would put enrollees at risk of receiving poor information from a Navigator who has no professional expertise or capacity to properly address the issue. For instance, while regulations restrict Navigators from providing tax assistance or advice, a requirement on all Navigators to provide information on taxes would substantially increase the risk that a consumer inappropriately receives tax advice. Navigators already stretched to meet their statutory duties may not appreciate the sometimes subtle difference between connecting people with information and providing advice.Recognizing this risk, a requirement to provide post-enrollment assistance may in fact conflict with the statutory duty to provide referrals. By requiring referrals, Congress showed a clear intent to connect consumers with experts when they experienced certain issues. A requirement on Navigators to provide the same type of assistance will encourage Navigators to stand in the place of these experts and undermines the congressional intent to connect consumers with expert advice in these circumstances.Exchange Direct Enrollment OptionEarlier this year, CMS finalized regulations to facilitate the Exchange Direct Enrollment option (Exchange DE option) in Part 1 of the 2022 Payment Notice, which provides a process for states to pursue a new Exchange model that takes better advantage of private sector entities to enroll people through the Exchange./9CMS now proposes to repeal the Exchange DE option, citing recent shifts in policy goals, new federal laws, lack of state interest, and a potential misalignment with administration priorities. Because the Exchange DE option offers a significant opportunity for states to improve the consumer enrollment experience through the Exchange, we oppose this proposal.A Promising New Exchange ModelThe ACA provides states with substantial flexibility in how they design and implement Exchanges. However, most states refused to implement Exchanges on their own and resorted to the federal default which offered only limited options. As the FFE platform has evolved, new opportunities emerged to give states more opportunities. In particular, the introduction of Enhanced Direct Enrollment (EDE) allowed the private sector to operate websites that provided all the consumer services necessary to enroll someone in an individual market QHP offered through the Exchange and access premium tax credits if they're eligible. This evolution finally ushered in an Exchange vision that so many people talked about at the time the ACA passed--a vision of enrollment websites like Expedia or Travelocity and, importantly, a vision of competing Exchange enrollment websites driven to deliver a better consumer experience.When CMS finalized the Exchange DE option, it noted several disadvantages to CMS operating a centralized, singular Exchange-operated website like HealthCare.gov. A single Exchange-operated website can be costly and burdensome to create and operate. A single Exchange enrollment pathway tends to create enrollment chokepoints that can impose challenges and even failures when large number of consumers come to enroll at the same time, such as the final day of the OEP. Finally, it's more difficult for a single Exchange-operated website to keep up with the rapid pace of technological innovation.Instead of states relying on a single Exchange-operated website, the Exchange DE option provides a regulatory process for states to adopt an Exchange model through which consumers can enroll in coverage through the FFE platform via multiple and competing private-sector websites. The Exchange DE option also formalizes a process to help State Based Exchanges (SBEs) adopt a similar Exchange model. This Exchange model meets all the statutory and regulatory requirements for operating an Exchange.Advantages of the Exchange DE OptionThe Exchange DE option provides states with a number of key advantages over the traditional Exchange. First, it builds off the substantial success of EDE, which is proving to be an attractive enrollment option that delivers a better consumer experience. In only its second full year of operation, the EDE pathway doubled enrollments during the 2021 OEP, increasing from from 521,000 to 1,130,000./10Moreover, the EDE pathway attracted a higher proportion of new consumers. This demonstrates the importance and effectiveness of private sector incentives to bringing in new enrollments, which are critical to maintaining a healthy risk pool. EDE also increased the portion of consumers who made active plan selections, another key indicator of how the private sector more effectively engages consumers.Understanding the benefits that EDE brings, the Exchange DE option strengthens these benefits by creating stronger incentives for the private sector to participate in EDE. Since Exchanges were launched in 2014, the single Exchange-operated website model has crowded out the private sector. By removing the dominant public sector competitor, the Exchange DE option makes EDE the primary enrollment platform and draws in more EDE competitors to drive a better consumer experience.No justification for repealWith these clear advantages, recent changes to policy and operation priorities do not justify the wholesale repeal of the Exchange DE option. Every new administration will bring in a new set of priorities and redirect resources to those priorities. CMS cited the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and the need to implement its new grant program for Exchange modernization and temporary expansion of premium tax credits as key policy changes that justify repealing the Exchange DE option. In light of the substantial work necessary to implement ARPA, it's entirely understandable to focus resources on that important work right now.However, it is not reasonable to use ARPA as a pretense for the wholesale repeal of the Exchange DE option. To justify repealing the Exchange DE option, the proposed rule relies largely on the need ""[t]o foreclose the possibility that federal funding and resources will be diverted from efforts to provide direct benefits to consumers made available under recent legislation to optional programs.""/11Yet this need is temporary. The ARPA provisions expire at the end of 2022 and, therefore, CMS will be able to transition back to normal operations. To protect federal resources from being diverted to optional programs, CMS could easily delay the effective date of the Exchange DE option.Aligns with Executive OrdersCMS also cites the priority to carry out Executive Orders 14009 and 13895 as reason to repeal the Exchange DE option. Yet, aside from the need to focus resources on implementing ARPA, the Exchange DE option aligns quite well with these executive orders. Consistent with EO 13985, as CMS explained earlier this year, ""the Exchange DE option holds potential to better connect vulnerable populations to coverage than a centralized one-size-fits-all Exchange model.""/12The private sector has proven to be very capable at connecting with new people and there is every reason to believe that, with the right incentives in place, the private sector would quickly develop new and better outreach programs for vulnerable populations.Consistent with both sections 1 and 3 of EO 14009, EDE has proven to be possibly the most effective policy to protect and strengthen the ACA. Time and again, prior implementation decisions undermined the strength of the ACA regulated insurance markets. As a recent CMS report on affordability explained, certain ACA implementation decisions led to higher premiums and kept healthier people out of the risk pool, including ""decisions on Exchange implementation, the allowance of transitional policies, and the lack of Exchange verification of eligibility for special enrollment periods.""/13In contrast, EDE brought the private sector back and re-introduced the powerful competitive dynamics a strong market needs to flourish. As noted previously, recent experience shows EDE brings more new people and spurs more active consumer engagement. Making EDE the primary enrollment platform would only serve to strengthen the ACA regulated markets and, importantly, better connect the millions of people eligible for subsidies under the ACA but remain uninsured.Repeal Can Only Weaken the ACAUltimately, the wholesale repeal of the Exchange DE option can only serve to weaken the ACA. Repealing the Exchange DE option will entirely foreclose the opportunity for a state to come forward with an Exchange model that would strengthen the ACA-regulated market. The Exchange DE option is strictly permissive for states and it is entirely at the discretion of CMS to approve or deny a state's proposal. There is no cost to maintaining the DE option aside from the resources necessary to review a state proposal. CMS is, therefore, making the determination that the resources necessary to review a state proposal outweighs the possibility a proposal could deliver better results and strengthen the ACA over the status quo.In other words, by repealing the Exchange DE option, CMS is prejudging every possible state proposal without ever seeing it and throwing away the possibility that a proposal could strengthen the ACA.Open Enrollment Period ExtensionUnder policies set by the Obama Administration, the annual open enrollment period (OEP) was shortened to run from November 1 to December 15 beginning for plan years starting January 1, 2019 and beyond./14The Market Stabilization Rule issued in April 2017 under the Trump administration advanced this change to begin for plan years starting January 1, 2018 and beyond./15CMS now proposes to extend the OEP by another four weeks to run from November 1 to January 15 of the following year. We oppose this proposal because the extension of the OEP would unnecessarily increase the risk of adverse selection and, therefore, weaken the ACA.Current OEP Benefits Consumers, Strengthens MarketIn the proposed rule, CMS outlined a number of strong reasons why maintaining the current OEP would benefit consumers and strengthen the market. The current OEP ensures consumers receive a full year of coverage and simplifies operational processes for issuers and Exchanges.Further, a consistent OEP promotes consumer confidence. CMS noted how the current OEP improved the consumer experience, citing observations that casework volumes related to coverage start dates and inadvertent dual enrollment decreased. CMS also explained how moving back to January 15 could cause consumer confusion about the need to enroll by December 15 for January 1 coverage and cause some consumers to miss coverage for January.Finally, CMS noted the adverse selection issue without discussion and only stated they ""do not anticipate a significant impact on the Exchange risk pool."" All of the reasons outlined by CMS weigh in favor of maintaining the current OEP.Negative Impacts of Current OEP are MinimalThe primary rationale CMS cites for extending the OEP by a full month is to help consumers who may unknowingly auto re-enroll into a plan with unexpected cost increases. This could occur if an enrollee happens to live an area where the premium for the benchmark plan declined and, consequently, reduced the value of the enrollee's premium tax credit. CMS cites no evidence that this is a widespread problem or a significant burden when it happens. As premiums have held steady over the past three years, the negative impact is likely minimal.Negative Impacts Easily MitigatedPeople already receive notices in September and October, including the Marketplace Open Enrollment Notice (MOEN) and issuer generated notices./16While the MOEN alerts consumers that they need to update their information for purposes of calculating APTC, issuer notices provide financial assistance amounts and identifies the re-enrollment plan for the upcoming plan year. To the extent people miss these notices and are uninformed or receive incomplete or inaccurate information in these notices, improved noticing offers a far better solution to mitigate this issue. Moreover, as noted in the EDE discussion, the expansion of EDE is encouraging more people to actively review their plan which increasingly mitigates this issue as EDE expands.CMS also noted the concerns of Navigators, CACs, and agents and brokers regarding people not having enough time to fully assist people during the OEP. However, CMS presented no evidence that more time to enroll will actually help. Assisters and brokers and agents will always have issues due to people waiting until the last minute. Changing when that last minute happens does not solve this problem. A better option is to implement policies to encourage people to sign up for coverage in November and not wait until the last minute.Adverse Selection Warrants Further ReviewAdverse selection warrants much more thorough consideration by CMS. There is clear evidence of people timing coverage and taking advantage of enrollment periods. Adding another month to the OEP gives people more opportunities to time coverage. After CMS implemented a shorter OEP and tightened SEPs through the Market Stabilization Rule, enrollees were more likely to maintain continuous coverage./17If there were no issue with adverse selection, employer-based health plans and Medicare would likely offer longer OEPs. Before further consideration of extending the OEP, we recommend that CMS undertake a much more rigorous analysis and subject that analysis to further public comment.In sum, on balance, the positive impacts of maintaining a 6-week OEP far outweigh the negative impacts outlined by CMS. To the extent negative impacts exist, enhanced consumer engagement is the answer.Monthly Special Enrollment Period for Low-Income APTC-eligibleIn addition to extending the OEP, CMS also proposes to create a monthly special enrollment for people with incomes lower than 150 percent of the federal poverty line (FPL). This would allow eligible people at that income level to enroll at any time they want during the year. CMS's main argument for proposing this policy is a response to the temporary availability of enhanced premium tax credits that subsidize the full premium for a silver-level plan under the ARPA.CMS worries that some consumers who qualify for these free premium plans will continue to forgo enrolling due to a lack of awareness. We oppose this policy because it is entirely unnecessary, would weaken the ACA by increasing adverse selection, and would violate both the text and spirit of the ACA.UnnecessaryWhile CMS expressed concerns about people missing the chance to enroll in premium-free plans, there are multiple opportunities in place right now for people to enroll in these plans.People with incomes under 150 percent already qualify for the COVID SEP and can immediately take advantage of zero-premium plans without a new SEP until August 15. Thus, people at this income level will have had 6 months since ARPA became law to become informed and sign up for a zero-premium plan. After the SEP ends, people newly eligible for premium subsidies will also have access to an SEP.CMS argues, even with ARPA, some consumers will continue to forgo coverage. But this is true for any benefit and therefore does not provide justification for the proposed changes. By this logic, there should be no rules on enrollment around any government benefit as there will always be a portion of people who lack awareness of the rules and fail to enroll.Increases Adverse SelectionCMS acknowledges the SEP would increase adverse selection. The agency estimates this adverse selection would increase premiums for consumers by 0.5 to 2.0 percent. CMS notes ""there is no limitation on how often individuals who are eligible for this special enrollment period can obtain or utilize it.""/18Therefore, individuals would be free to jump in and out of health plans as often as they want. In addition, it is likely such an open-ended SEP coupled with the lengthy and sometimes burdensome enrollment process provided by HealthCare.gov would cause many healthy enrollees to wait until they get sick to enroll in coverage.Adverse selection has been a serious problem under the ACA's guaranteed availability requirements. Actuaries have consistently identified the ACA's community rating and guaranteed availability requirements as leading contributors to the substantial increase in premiums that occurred after the ACA's main regulations to effect in 2014. Enrollment periods are one of the few tools to mitigate this negative impact of the ACA. Rules to tighten enrollment periods proved successful. After the CMS finalized the Market Stabilization Rule and additional SEP policies in the 2019 payment notice, premiums stabilized and insurers gained confidence to reenter ACA markets.Any move to loosen these restrictions risks turning back the gains made to strengthen the ACA's market over the past few years. This would clearly be inconsistent with EO 14009's directive to strengthen the ACA. Considering there is no clear need or advantage to this SEP, there is no reasonable justification to revert to looser SEP requirements.Violates the StatuteThe ACA allows insurance companies in the individual market to restrict enrollment to open enrollment or special enrollment periods./19It further requires insurers to, at a minimum, establish the special enrollment periods for qualifying life events that apply to group health plans./20In regards to the Exchange, the ACA also requires HHS to establish an initial open enrollment, an annual open enrollment period, the same special enrollment periods that apply to group health plans under the IRS Code, other special enrollment periods similar to circumstances for periods identified for Medicare Part D enrollment, and special monthly enrollment periods for Indians./21Based on the prescriptive nature of how the statute itemizes a list of required enrollment periods for Exchanges, the statute limits CMS from requiring additional enrollment periods that are not included in the list. This reading naturally follows the interpretative canon expressio unius est exclusion alterius (the inclusion of one is the exclusion of the other).The ACA includes various provisions that impose a list of requirements on the Secretary, which then give the Secretary discretion to add to the list. For instance, the same section of the ACA includes a requirement on health plans to submit specific information on transparency in coverage to the Secretary and the last item on the list provides for ""Other information as determined appropriate by the Secretary.""/22The list of required enrollment periods does not include any similar language giving the Secretary discretion to add to the list. To the extent discretion is allowed it is based on the Secretary's discretion to define an SEP itemized in the list, such as the meaning of ""exceptional circumstance.""The proposed monthly SEP does not fit within any SEP itemized in statute and, therefore, the statute limits CMS from requiring this monthly SEP. The inclusion of one monthly enrollment period for Indians on the list provides further evidence that Congress meant to exclude any other monthly enrollment period. Congress likely understood the importance of enrollment periods to the overall structure and stability of the ACA and how they functioned as one of the few checks against adverse selection. Therefore, it makes sense how Congress chose to limit the Secretary's discretion to add enrollment periods that risk undermining the risk pool.User Fee RatesCMS reduced the Exchange user fee rate from 3.5 percent to 3.0 percent for the 2020 and 2021 benefit years/23 and then reduced the fee to 2.25 percent for the 2022 benefit year./24CMS now proposes to increase the user fee to 2.75 percent to help fund the additional costs of expanded services, including increased funding for the Navigator program and consumer outreach and education. We oppose increasing the user fee because any increase will result in higher premiums, excess collections from prior years would cover the cost of expanded services, and reversing CMS's strategy to draw down excess collections likely violates federal law and regulation.Increases premiums, reduces affordabilityBecause insurers are required to adjust the premium index rate based on the Exchange user fee, prior reductions in the Exchange user fee translated into a direct reduction in premium for consumers./25Likewise, any increase in the user fee will translate into higher premiums. As this action will undoubtedly make health coverage less affordable for some people, this proposal clearly contravenes EO 14009's directive to make healthcare affordable for every American.People with incomes too high to qualify for subsidies were exposed to dramatic premium increases after the ACA's main regulations took effect. According to CMS, average monthly premiums increased from $242 in 2013 to $352 in 2014 and reached $588 by 2018--a 143 percent increase./26While premiums finally stabilized in 2019, premiums remain unaffordable for people who don't qualify for subsidies. Higher premiums also impose additional burdens on Federal taxpayers. Due to the affordability crisis in the individual market, there is simply no reasonable justification to take deliberate steps that would result in higher premiums.Excess Collections Can Cover Additional CostsEarlier this year CMS committed to increase funding for the Navigator program, as well as consumer outreach and education. This boost in funding was not necessary based on prior experience. As previously noted, Navigators historically failed to enroll enough people to justify the funding levels they received. Moreover, funding on outreach was never clearly shown to impact enrollment much. Enrollment actually dropped on HealthCare.gov after CMS boosted outreach funding from $51 million to $100 million for the 2017 OEP./27Regardless of the wisdom of this funding increase, it cannot justify an increase in the user fee because excess collections from prior years would fully cover this additional cost. The user fee was previously lowered due to a number of factors, including the accumulation of ""prior years' additional collections.""/28The proposal to raise the user fee completely disregards this important factor guiding previous decisions by CMS to lower the user fee. As such, the proposal provides no evidence that this excess in collections from prior years is not sufficient to support the lower user fee.Even without excess collections from prior years, an increase in user fee collections in 2021 and 2022 due to increased enrollment from ARPA's expanded premium subsidies would likely fully fund these additional costs. Effectuated enrollment showed an increase of 6 percent in February 2021 compared to the prior year and projects even more enrollment with expansion of premium tax credits under ARPA./29Just a 6 percent increase in enrollment would increase user fee revenues by possibly $75 million. Without any contrary evidence from CMS, this increase in user fee collections can be assumed to fund a majority if not the entire increase in funding for Navigators and outreach and education.Reversing Strategy to Draw Down Excess Collections May Violate LawPrior CMS rulemaking took responsibility for excess collections from prior years and CMS has a duty to spend the excess collections on eligible user fee expenses. As explained in the 2020 payment notice, ""any collections in excess of user fee eligible costs for a given year are rolled over for spending to the subsequent year's user fee eligible expenses.""/30Allowing the user fee to accumulate from year to year without proper adjustment to account for excess collections would effectively constitute a charge in excess of the ""Full Cost"" to the federal government in violation of section 6(a)(2) of OMB Circular A-25. The legal implications of an excess charge are not entirely clear, but there are limits on the federal government's power to collect user fees. Maintaining excess collections from year to year and doing nothing to ensure collections are carefully spent on user-fee eligible expenses would likely violate legal requirements around the administration of a user fee.Section 1332 WaiversIn December 2015, CMS issued controversial guidance on 1332 waivers which, as two writers for the Health Affairs blog explained, ""considerably limits [State] flexibility.""/31CMS and the Department of the Treasury (the Departments) issued updated guidance in October 2018,/32 which replaced the 2015 guidance/33 to give states significantly more flexibility. In January 2021, the Departments then codified much of the policy included in the 2018 guidance into regulatory provisions related to 1332 waivers./34The Departments now propose to remove the recent codification of the 2018 guidance after determining that it is generally inconsistent with EO 14009 and EO 13985. The Departments also propose new policies and applications of the statute that they state ""aligns with the Administration's goals to strengthen the ACA and increase enrollment in comprehensive, affordable coverage among the remaining underinsured and insured.""/35We oppose this substantial shift in policy because it would eviscerate states' flexibility to innovate and implement new state health programs, and ultimately fail to accomplish the goals the Departments hope to achieve.Eviscerates State Flexibility to InnovateAs just noted, the Departments issued guidance in 2018 to replace the 2015 guidance that was broadly understood to severely limit a state's flexibility. When adopting the 2018 guidance, the Departments cited how ""[t]he 2015 guidance imposed significant restrictions on states in meeting the guardrails beyond what was required by the PPACA.""/36The proposed rule would reverse the flexibility provided in 2018 and revert once again to imposing significant restrictions on states that go well beyond what the ACA requires.Section 1332 of the ACA allows states to waive a number of the ACA's key provisions, such as requirements to cover essential health benefits, establish Exchanges, and provide premium tax credits. These and other requirements can be waived so long as the state program meets additional statutory requirements, often called guardrails. In general, the guardrails require a state plan to provide coverage that is at least as comprehensive and affordable as coverage without the waiver, provide coverage to comparable number of people as without the waiver, and not increase the federal deficit.While the proposal claims ""it would empower states to develop innovative health coverage options ... that best fits the states' individual needs and provide coverage to their residents,""/37 in practice the rule would basically limit states to developing waivers that mirror the ACA. It does this by applying the guardrails in a manner that forces a state waiver to ensure individuals are enrolled in at least the same level of comprehensive and affordable coverage as the ACA already requires. In contrast, current federal regulations require a state waiver to ensure individuals have access to the same comprehensive and affordable coverage as available without the waiver under ACA requirements.This access standard gives states meaningful flexibility to expand the types of coverage options a state waiver can provide. So long as the waiver provides access to the same level of comprehensiveness and affordability as the ACA requires without a waiver, a state can provide access to other types of coverage that don't meet these ACA requirements. For instance, this would include allowing coverage that provides lower premiums, but that does not meet the ACA's cost sharing requirements. The proposed rule would eliminate this flexibility.In addition to severely limiting flexibility under the comprehensiveness and affordability guardrails, the proposed rule would also reduce the flexibility in meeting the coverage guardrail be narrowing the type of coverage that can be counted.Changes Would Undermine Congressional IntentTo justify the proposed changes, the Departments conclude the 2018 Guidance and the incorporation of its guardrail interpretations into regulation ""do not represent the best fulfillment of congressional intent behind the statutory guardrails.""/38This statement is made without any rationale, which is remarkable considering Part 1 of the 2022 Payment Notice included a thorough explanation as to how the 2018 Guidance is ""based on a sound interpretation of section 1332 of the PPACA"" and follows the plain language of the statute./39Congress intended to give states a meaningful level of flexibility to develop and implement innovative new state health programs. The 1332 waiver represents Congress's recognition that states have always played the primary role in regulating insurance and administering public health care programs. Moreover, several provisions in the ACA specifically assert Congress's general intent to maintain the state's primary role./40A review of the plain language reveals that Congress clearly did not intend to establish guardrails that require people to enroll in plans that meet the same affordability and comprehensiveness requirements as the ACA. Yet, as noted, the proposed regulations would basically allow a waiver from the requirements of the ACA only so long as the waiver meets the requirements of the ACA. This is made very clear in the way CMS critiques current regulations for allowing consumers to enroll in ""plans that do not fully meet ACA requirements.""/41It defies any rational basis to conclude Congress intended to allow states to waive certain requirements of the ACA so long as the state waiver fully meets the waived ACA requirements.But that is exactly what the Departments are proposing. Section 1332 clearly allows states to waive the ACA's essential health benefit requirements under section 1302(b). Yet, the proposal would require a state waiver plan to ensure people actually enroll in plans that meet the requirements of 1302(b). In addition, section 1332 clearly allows states to waive cost sharing limits in section 1302(c) and actuarial value (AV) levels established in 1302(d). Yet to meet the affordability guardrail, the proposal would require a state waiver plan to ensure people actually enroll in ""coverage that provides both an actuarial value equal to or greater than 60 percent and an out-of-pocket maximum that complies with section 1302(c)(1) of the ACA.""/42Congress could not have intended this outcome when they included the flexibility for states to waive these ACA requirements. It simply makes no sense that Congress intended to allow a state to waive certain requirements outlined in Section 1332 only to then require the state waiver plan to meet those same requirements under the statutory guardrails.By contrast, the access standard delivers the most sensible interpretation of congressional intent because it gives meaning to the full text of the statute. Specifically, the access standard gives meaning to the guardrails requirement that a waiver must provide coverage that is ""at least as comprehensive as the coverage defined in section 1302(b) and, at the same time, gives meaning to the flexibility to apply for a waiver from the requirements of section 1302(b).Guardrail Application Could be Made More ConsistentThe proposed rule notes how some commenters find the current regulation ""allows for a disjointed application of the guardrails whereby a state can meet the coverage guardrail, while its waiver plan reduces the overall comprehensiveness and affordability of coverage in the state."" While maybe not disjointed, the application of the three guardrails is not consistent and may not provide the full flexibility that Congress intended. Each of these three guardrails begin with the direction that a state waiver plan ""will provide"". For the comprehensiveness and affordability guardrails, the preamble to Part 1 of the 2022 payment notice notes the term ""provide"" means ""to supply or make available"" and this plain language strongly supports the access standard./43This access standard, however, is not applied in the same way to the coverage guardrail despite the use of the same language.To maintain consistency, CMS could consider also applying the access standard to the coverage guardrail. This application would give states more flexibility to consider waivers that provide access to coverage to at least a comparable number of residents without requiring the same number of residents to actually purchase coverage. However, it's unlikely any state would actually pursue a waiver that forecasted a drop in the number of covered people and offsetting increase in the number of uninsured.Current Flexibility Would Not Diminish Affordability of Comprehensive PlansThe flexibility introduced under the access standard has regularly met unfair criticism from people who claim the allowance of alternative coverage options could undermine the individual market risk pool for comprehensive coverage and make this coverage less affordable for people with pre-existing conditions. Maybe it's just unclear drafting, but CMS now appears to endorse the view that this flexibility creates the possibility of ""diminished affordability of comprehensive coverage.""/44This is flatly wrong and directly contravenes the clear statement from Part 1 of the 2022 Payment Notice which states, ""consistent with the 2018 Guidance, that the Departments will consider the comprehensiveness and affordability guardrails met if a waiver plan provides access to coverage that is as comprehensive and affordable as coverage forecasted to have been available in the absence of the waiver.""/45Since issuing the 2018 guidance, CMS has consistently explained that any waiver that diminishes the affordability of comprehensive coverage cannot be approved and would fail to meet the guardrails.Decreases Choice and Opportunity for Vulnerable PopulationsThe proposed rule noted concerns that alternative plan options can terminate or deny coverage based on health status and created the possibility that individuals with greater health needs might go without effective coverage. Yet, the Departments never acknowledge that these individuals would always have access to the same level of affordable and comprehensive coverage as without the waiver. The harm, apparently, is providing people a choice. Vulnerable populations might choose poorly.This ignores how waiver flexibility might allow states to better tailor plans for people with greater health needs. A waiver might also target benefits or even subsidies to certain vulnerable populations. The proposed rule would shut down any state flexibility to develop plans that might strike a different balance between comprehensiveness and specific needs of vulnerable populations. In this way it would decrease choice and opportunity for these vulnerable populations and undermine the goals set out in EO 13985.Ignores TradeoffsShutting down the flexibility for states to strike a different balance between comprehensiveness and specific needs of vulnerable populations reflects a more widespread weakness of the proposed rule. Throughout, the rule fails to acknowledge the existence of tradeoffs--in particular, tradeoffs between policies that promote comprehensiveness versus affordability.More comprehensive policies tend to be less affordable and vice versa. The 2018 guidance recognized these tradeoffs and further recognized states and individuals are in a better position to make these tradeoffs than the federal government. Without acknowledging tradeoffs, the Departments are in a real sense failing to acknowledge the fundamental problems facing America's health care system.Weakens the ACAThe provision of Section 1332 State Innovation Waivers is an incredibly important feature built into the ACA. These waivers recognize there may be better ways to structure a state health plan than the requirements Congress set to paper in 2010. Waivers give states the opportunity to explore and test out innovative approaches to achieve better outcomes than may be possible under the strictures of the ACA. By creating this opportunity for states to achieve better outcomes, this opportunity to waive the ACA's requirements in a real sense strengthens the ACA.By eviscerating the flexibility Congress intended to give states, the proposed rule would clearly weaken the ACA by substantially diminishing the opportunities for states to innovate health plans that could achieve better outcomes.Thank you for your consideration of these comments.Sincerely,Peter J.

The Red Cross has issued the following COVID-19 information for donors: The Red Cross is testing blood, platelet and plasma donations for COVID-19 antibodies. The test may indicate if the donor’s immune system has produced antibodies to this coronavirus, regardless of whether an individual developed COVID-19 symptoms. Red Cross antibody tests will be helpful to identify individuals who have COVID-19 antibodies and may now help current coronavirus patients in need of convalescent plasma transfusions.
Convalescent plasma is a type of blood donation collected from COVID-19 survivors that have antibodies that may help patients who are actively fighting the virus. Plasma from whole blood donations that test positive for COVID-19 antibodies may be used to help COVID-19 patients. COVID-19 antibody test results will be available within one to two weeks in the Red Cross Blood Donor App or donor portal at RedCrossBlood.org. A positive antibody test result does not confirm infection or immunity. The Red Cross is not testing donors to diagnose illness, referred to as a diagnostic test. To protect the health and safety of Red Cross staff and donors, it is important that individuals who do not feel well or believe they may be ill with COVID-19 postpone donation. Each Red Cross blood drive and donation center follows the highest standards of safety and infection control, and additional precautions – including temperature checks, social distancing and face coverings for donors and staff – have been implemented to help protect the health of all those in attendance. Donors are asked to schedule an appointment prior to arriving at the drive and are required to wear a face covering or mask while at the drive, in alignment with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention public guidance.

741,"GREEN BAY, Wis. - Green Bay Packers CEO Mark Murphy says he believes the uncertainty surrounding MVP Aaron Rodgers' future has divided the team's fan base.
""The emails and letters that I've received reflect this fact,"" Murphy said in a monthly column on the Packers' website in which he answers questions from fans.
Rodgers hasn't participated in the Packers' voluntary organized team activities, a change from his usual offseason routine. The Packers begin their mandatory minicamp Tuesday.
ESPN reported in the hours leading up to the draft that Rodgers doesn't want to return to Green Bay, where the three-time MVP has spent his entire career.
""We remain committed to resolving things with Aaron and want him to be our quarterback in 2021 and beyond,"" Murphy said as he reiterated comments he'd made in a column a month earlier. ""We are working to resolve the situation and realize that the less both sides say publicly, the better.""
Packers coach Matt LaFleur and general manager Brian Gutekunst have both said they want Rodgers back. Gutekunst has said he won't trade Rodgers, who has three years left on his contract.
In his column, Murphy also replied to a letter critical of Gutekunst by expressing support for the general manager.
""I must tell you that I have tremendous confidence in Brian Gutekunst,"" Murphy said. ""In his relatively short tenure as our GM, he has completely turned around the fortunes of our team.""
HOCKEY
Lightning strike for 3-1 series lead
TAMPA, Fla. - Nikita Kucherov and Steven Stamkos each had two goals and an assist, and the Tampa Bay Lightning beat the Carolina Hurricanes, 6-4, on Saturday to open a commanding lead in their second-round playoff series.
The defending Stanley Cup champions improved to 10-0 in games following a playoff loss over the past two postseasons. They lead the Hurricanes, 3-1, in the best-of-seven series heading into Game 5 on Tuesday night at Carolina.
Each team scored four goals in the second, with the Lightning turning a 4-2 deficit into a 5-4 lead. Stamkos and Kucherov scored on the power play.
Canada beats U.S. in hockey world semifinals
RIGA, Latvia - Andrew Mangiapane scored two goals to help Canada beat the United States, 4-2, on Saturday in the semifinals of hockey's world championship.
Mangiapane has seven goals and four assists in six games since joining Canada midway through the preliminary round. Canada started the tournament with three straight losses, but has five wins and a shootout loss since Mangiapane was added to the mix.

Allmendinger rallies for Xfinity win
LEXINGTON, Ohio - A.J. Allmendinger rallied from a penalty, benefited from a late caution and used a sweeping three-wide pass for the lead to win the Xfinity Series race at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course. Saturday's victory was Allmendinger's second of the season and came on what Kaulig Racing considers its home track. Allmendinger had to rally after a pit-road penalty dropped him to 19th near the end of the second stage.
BASKETBALL
Clifford, Magic agree to part ways
Steve Clifford and the Orlando Magic took some time after the season to rest, recover and contemplate the future.
And after a couple weeks, they decided the fit wasn't right anymore. Orlando's rebuilding project will no longer include Clifford, after he and the Magic completed an agreement Saturday to end his three-year run with the club. Clifford was 96-131 in those three seasons.
GOLF
Rahm out of Memorial despite 6-stroke lead
DUBLIN, Ohio - Jon Rahm walked off the 18th green after tying the 54-hole record and building a six-shot lead, leaving him on the cusp of joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners of the Memorial.
Moments later, he doubled over behind the green and said in anguish, ""Not again!""
Rahm was notified he tested positive for the coronavirus, knocking him out of the tournament. The PGA Tour said the Spaniard had come in close contact with a person who was COVID-19 positive, meaning he could play provided he was tested daily. Every test came back negative except the one after his second round that was completed Saturday morning.
Herron shoots 9-under to take lead in Iowa
DES MOINES - Tim Herron shot a 9-under 63 on Saturday to take a four-stroke lead in the PGA Tour Champions' Principal Charity Classic. Trying to win for the first time on the 50-and-over tour, Herron birdied the par-4 18th for a back-nine 30 and 14-under 130 total at Wakonda Club. The 51-year-old from Minnesota, a four-time winner on the PGA Tour, birdied three of the first five holes.

743,"As Tulare County enters the third year of the coronavirus pandemic, local leaders spoke in a virtual 210 Connect forum about what's working and what's not, and how the region's hospitals, schools and farmworkers are faring.
2021 brought the widespread rollout of vaccines and a glimpse of a light at the end of the tunnel before the advent of first the delta, and then the highly contagious omicron variant threw a wrench in the prospect of things returning to normal.
Kaweah Health CEO Gary Herbst said during the Tuesday forum titled ""Tulare County Voices at 210: Two Years Into the Pandemic"" that more than half of the hospital's 5,100 employees had contracted the virus throughout the pandemic.
He questioned the wisdom of widespread lockdowns.
""I don't know if these lockdowns really work. You know, we had to shut down surgery multiple times just to prepare in case of COVID. I think the jury's still out in terms of just how effective those precautions are,"" he said.
Tulare County Public Health manager Tiffany Swarthout said that isolation and quarantine measures at the dawn of the pandemic were effective in keeping case rates down but acknowledged that they caused people to get restless over time.
""I think early on in the pandemic — when people were really abiding by quarantine and isolation procedures when they were positive and exposed — that's where you're seeing the most effective use of those tools,"" she said. ""As things progress, people understandably got restless.""
She spoke of the county's challenges in terms of health care access. Doctors and clinics are in scarce supply in the county's rural reaches, complicating access to vaccinations and information about the pandemic.
She also addressed the county's lower-than-average vaccination rates, saying that it's not the health department's role to convince people who have made up their minds about the vaccine's efficacy. Instead, the county has focused its efforts on reaching those on the fence by providing accurate information about the vaccine's safety and benefits.
Both Swarthout and Herbst agreed that vaccines and booster shots remain the most effective tool we have to combat the pandemic.
The vast majority of patients who have been admitted to the hospital with COVID, or who end up in the ICU, or sadly enough pass away from COVID, the vast majority are unvaccinated,"" Herbst said. ""Vaccines absolutely do work.""
The hospital leader added that other factors, such as leading a healthy lifestyle and exercising regularly, can help protect residents from experiencing severe COVID cases. Most of the patients who die of COVID-19 have an underlying condition, such as diabetes or hypertension, he said.
In the fields: Reaching out to rural ag, farmworker communities
The pandemic has disproportionately impacted some Tulare County residents and industries. Among the hardest hit: Farmworkers and agriculture communities.
Community advocate and former county lawmaker Lali Moheno spoke to the importance of meeting farmworkers and hard-to-reach communities where they are. Lack of transportation and health clinics combined with a mistrust of government, particularly among the undocumented immigrant community, have created a perfect storm for COVID to run rampant across the rural county.
""In order to address a rural county all the way, you ... have to go to them,"" she said. ""They have transportation issues. They have the language (barrier); they have fear, they have mistrust.""
To address these concerns, Moheno and other organizations have worked with the county to meet farmworkers in the fields with vaccinations available for those who want them. The groups have also provided culturally competent care and information, in Spanish and other languages, to those living in the county's many rural towns and hamlets.
At one Porterville event, Moheno said organizers were able to vaccinate 1,200 individuals.
Herbst said Kaweah Health is working on expanding rural health access with clinics in Lindsay, Exeter, Dinuba, and Tulare. He said the clinics provide a ""full gamut of services"" from COVID testing to treatment and accept patients regardless of their insurance or document status.
""Our rural health clinics have never been busier as a result,"" he said, adding that Kaweah is looking at other ways the hospital can ""serve people where they live rather than the traditional making them come into your facilities.""
COVID-19 and schools
Schools have been particularly challenged by the pandemic, forced to juggle the community's health with the mental health and educational needs of students — and Visalia Unified is no exception, interim Superintendent Doug Cardoza said at the forum.
The pandemic exposed and highlighted inequity among VUSD students, with some unable to access the internet or eat regularly without the district providing those services.
""We're used to having hot meals at school, and so when we shut down our schools, and our kids were at home and online, we quickly found that weakness in our system. We found the inequities within our system,"" he said.
The district implemented a successful hot meals program and expanded broadband access with mobile hotspots and antennas deployed districtwide.
""We're much better prepared now if we had to toggle back to a situation where kids were at home. In fact, any kid that's quarantined now, they're able to zoom into their classroom and not miss a day of instruction.""
While the option is there for families who choose to stick with distance learning, Cardoza said the COVID-19 situation has improved considerably at VUSD campuses.
At the peak of omicron and delta's surges, VUSD saw between 80 and 100 staff out each day who couldn't be covered with a limited substitute pool. That number dropped to just four teachers out on COVID-19 leave this week, he said.
""Today, we actually have some extra substitute teachers, so that's a great sign,"" he said. ""But through all this we really learned that we do have some equity issues within our system that we have to address.""
COVID-19 goes 'endemic'
The 210 forum happened on the same day that state health officials announced California had entered an ""endemic"" stage of the virus, meaning that public health guidance will focus on prevention and specific outbreaks over mandatory masking and business closures.
Countywide, new coronavirus cases are plateauing, and deaths are down. Tulare County Public Health reported 2,006 new infections and 11 deaths for the week of Feb. 15.
Infections peaked at 8,000 new weekly infections mid-January and 25 deaths last week, fueled mainly by the waning omicron variant, which quickly exploded across the county earlier this year.

746,"For Elemental shareholders who have questions or require additional information, please contact: Laurel Hill Advisory Group: North American Toll-Free: 1-877-452-7184 (+1-416-304-0211 outside North America), E-mail: assistance@laurelhill.com
VANCOUVER, BC, Jan. 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ - Gold Royalty Corp. (NYSE American: GROY) (""Gold Royalty"", or the ""Company"") is pleased to provide an update on its growth plans, and its proposed acquisition of Elemental Royalties Corp. (TSXV: ELE) (""Elemental""). Continuing its trajectory of disciplined expansion and growth over the past year, Gold Royalty has offered to acquire all of the issued and outstanding Elemental common shares (the ""Elemental Shares"") for consideration of 0.27 of a Gold Royalty common share (a ""Gold Royalty Share"") per Elemental Share (the ""Offer"") as set forth in Gold Royalty's Offer and Circular dated January 11, 2022 (the ""Offer and Circular""). 
""The acquisition of Elemental will be the fourth corporate transaction undertaken by Gold Royalty within the last 12 months, representing an unprecedented pace of accretive growth and resulting in a diverse and well-balanced portfolio of high-quality precious metal royalty assets with peer-leading growth. Since our oversubscribed US$90 million initial public offering in March 2021, we have successfully acquired Ely Gold Royalties, Abitibi Royalties and Golden Valley. Additionally, we declared our inaugural dividend, secured a flexibility-enhancing credit facility from the Bank of Montreal and achieved strong trading liquidity for our shareholders"", said David Garofalo, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of Gold Royalty. 
""We are excited to welcome Elemental shareholders into the Gold Royalty family and with the acquisition of Elemental's nine royalties, Gold Royalty will hold 200 royalties anchored by our existing gold-focused royalties in two of the best mining jurisdictions in the world, Quebec and Nevada. Our large, diversified portfolio will generate significant cash flows over a long life cycle, support future dividend growth, and position us to aggressively pursue acquisitions and further consolidation in the royalty sector, all for the benefit of our shareholders.""
Together, we believe Gold Royalty and Elemental will create value for all stakeholders through the following:Continued Growth – Gold Royalty possesses sector-leading growth driven by its existing royalty portfolio, with research analysts[1] estimating a compounded annual growth rate in revenue in excess of 60% over the next 3 years. Instead of incurring equity dilution in a highly competitive and scarce market for precious metal royalty acquisitions, the shareholders of Elemental will benefit from and contribute to Gold Royalty's strong organic growth platform.Diversification –The combined portfolio will be anchored in Tier 1 jurisdictions, including Quebec, Nevada and Australia. Diversification protects shareholders against asset concentration risk as well as geopolitical risk. Illustratively, one of Elemental's nine royalties is located in a jurisdiction which is currently experiencing significant political upheaval. In a small royalty portfolio, such as Elemental's, such turmoil poses material risk to shareholders. Within Gold Royalty, Elemental shareholders will be less exposed to such risk. Dividends – Despite only completing its IPO less than 12 months ago, Gold Royalty declared its first quarterly dividend on January 18, 2022, demonstrating a firm commitment to returning capital to shareholders. Conversely, Elemental's current level of indebtedness has likely restricted its ability to return cash flow to shareholders. With the anticipated production timelines for the mines underlying the Company's royalty holdings, the Gold Royalty board intends to periodically reassess the level of dividend payments with the goal of returning additional cash flow to shareholders in the future with or without the addition of the Elemental portfolio. The proposed acquisition of Elemental has the potential to accelerate the pace of future dividend increases.Financial Strength – Gold Royalty had approximately US$38 million in cash and marketable securities with no debt as at January 21, 2022. Additionally on January 24, 2022, the Company announced a revolving credit facility with the Bank of Montreal for up to US$25 million. Conversely, as of September 30, 2021, Elemental had high-cost net debt of US$19 million. Within Gold Royalty, Elemental shareholders will benefit from our strong, debt-free balance sheet, which provides enhanced flexibility to pursue accretive acquisitions. Trading Liquidity – Gold Royalty enjoys peer-leading trading liquidity on the NYSE American. In part, this liquidity benefits from the Company's inclusion in the Junior Gold Miners ETF (GDXJ). As recently as December 17, 2021, Gold Royalty's weighting on the GDXJ was increased three-fold, which drove significant increased demand for Gold Royalty Shares. Over the six months leading to Gold Royalty's announcement of its intention to make the Offer, Elemental's average daily share trading liquidity represented less than 2% of Gold Royalty's. Within Gold Royalty, it is expected that Elemental shareholders will benefit from significantly improved trading liquidity and a potential re-rating as a result of Gold Royalty's GDXJ index membership.Scale - The benefits of consolidation, in addition to talent and asset quality, are best measured in terms of capital markets and operating scale which combine to drive more predictable earnings, lower G&A (as a percentage of revenue), increased trading liquidity, lower cost of capital and, ultimately, higher valuations. This creates a virtuous cycle in which capital can be more efficiently deployed on an accretive basis to drive further growth. It is this dynamic which we believe the market is recognizing and rewarding in our recent acquisitions. We firmly believe that a combination between Gold Royalty and Elemental will result in a similar outcome, which will continue to benefit all shareholders._____________________

749,"DENVER, Nov. 2, 2021 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- As we head into the holidays, health and wellness are top of mind, and who doesn't want a little Unicorn Dust or Secret Stuff to fill their stockings? With names that are as fun as the items are hard-working, Friction Labs delivers the new standard in chalk for athletes who demand a better grip. 
""I use Friction Labs Secret Stuff liquid chalk to keep my hands dry and give me a stronger grip while climbing and weightlifting,"" said NFL Left Guard Wes Schweitzer, from the Washington Football Team. ""Many of my climbing and lifting exercises are similar, which benefits my play on the field with increased awareness, core strength, grip strength, overall strength and athleticism. Thanks to climbing last year I had my best season yet and expect to be even better this year.""
For the fitness fanatic list, Friction Labs athletic chalk is giftable for any athlete in archery, CrossFit, climbing, disc golf, golf, gymnastics, racquet sports, sharpshooting, weightlifting and more. Originally developed to meet the demands of rock climbers, their chalk products are now used and trusted by top athletes requiring dependable, long-lasting grip, making it the perfect gift this holiday season with many options under $20.
""All of our products, from loose chalk to liquid chalk, are a great surprise for the athletes on your holiday list,"" said Keah Kalantari, co-founder of Friction Labs. ""The foundation of Friction Labs has always been to create athletic chalk that enables every athlete, across a wide variety of sports, to reach their maximum potential by providing a safe, healthy, strong, dry grip, making our chalk the perfect stocking stuffer for your athlete."" 
From the fan-favorite ultra-fine Unicorn Dust to the newest Secret Stuff Hygienic liquid chalk, Friction Labs products are all made in the U.S., stripped of unnecessary fillers and additives, and have zero drying agents. The high purity magnesium carbonate provides long-lasting moisture absorption and is great for all skin types. 
""In 2020 when the pandemic hit, we knew we needed to provide athletes with a product to keep them safe while working out,"" said Kevin Brown, CEO and co-founder of Friction Labs. ""We created the first chalk cream that outperformed hand sanitizer at killing COVID-19 and pathogenic bacteria called Secret Stuff Hygienic.""
The purity of Friction Labs chalk is so high that it has even been used in the brewing of beer. In 2021 the company partnered with Denver's first and oldest brewpub, Wynkoop Brewing Company, to enrich the flavor of their hand-crafted beer by adding Unicorn Dust to the brew. Water in Colorado lacks the necessary nutrients and minerals to complement the taste of the beer, which means master brewers must add them into the brewing process. The brewing company has been adding Friction Labs chalk to their specially crafted IPA ensuring a smooth pillowy taste to the three batches. 
Friction Labs products include: 
Liquid Chalk One bottle lasts up to 100 uses with no mess and promotes healthy skin as it's made with non-toxic, silica-free, pigment-free chalk making it safe for kids and adults. Choose from three varieties that dry in 20-90 seconds: Secret Stuff Original, Alcohol Free Secret Stuff and Secret Stuff Hygienic, a chalk cream that outperformed hand sanitizer at killing COVID-19 and pathogenic bacteria.Loose Chalk High performance loose chalk for every preference means chalking up less, overcoming grip issues from sweat, rain, humidity, oils and sunscreen. Choose from three varieties, ultrafine Unicorn Dust, chunky Gorilla Grip, or super chunky Bam Bam. All products are available at Friction Labs, Amazon or gyms and retail locations across the United States.

750,"
The 2020 WNBA season was not the fresh start Tina Charles was hoping for.
After six seasons with the Liberty, Charles found herself in a rut. Although she was  an All-Star in 2019, she had the worst 2- and 3-point shooting percentages of her career while averaging just under 17 points per game. In April 2020, she was traded to the  Mystics and reunited with Mike Thibault, who coached her when she played for the  Sun from 2010 to 2013. 
However, Charles did not get the opportunity to play for Thibault and his 2019 WNBA champion team last year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Charles has extrinsic asthma and was medically excused for the season after  Washington's team doctor declared her high risk. Despite the disappointment of not competing, Charles took the extra time off as an opportunity to put in even more work. 
""I was going to the gym every single day with my trainer,"" she told USA TODAY Sports. ""That was literally my day: wake up, go drive to Brooklyn, and work out. That's all that I was doing, just trying to stay engaged. Working on my game in the offseason and coming into this year just seeing the way that D.C. plays, I didn't want to lack anything.""
That extra training paid off because Thibault said he had never seen a player come into training camp at the high level of physical fitness that Charles did for the 2021 season.
""She is somebody who was highly motivated to come in and prove herself to the world that, 'I'm still one of the elite players,'"" Thibault said. ""She came in incredible shape. I don't know if I've had a player come in better shape than she did to this training camp, so she was absolutely ready to go.""
At 32, Charles is having one of the best years of her career. She has led the league in scoring for most of the season, averaging 25.4 points per game, which is also a career high. Going into Tuesday, she was posting career bests in 3-point (36.5%) and free-throw shooting (85.1%) percentages as well.
Charles is also leaving her mark on the record books, climbing to No. 2 indouble-doubles and No. 8 in points. On June 22, she became the first player in WNBA history to record more than 30 points, more than 15 rebounds and at least five assists and five 3-pointers in a game. 
Despite her historic numbers, Charles does not see her performances this season as anything spectacular. Playing her best is just part of the job description.
""I believe it's my job to come out the way that I've come out this year,"" she said. ""I always strive to get better each and every single year. I just love to be consistent, so I just see it as my job. It's just what I'm supposed to do: go out and be as dominant as I possibly can.""
Thibault coached Charles for three years when she played with the Sun, including her MVP season in 2012. He said he has seen her develop into a stronger athlete each year over her 11 seasons in the league. 
""She's improved her 3-point shooting. She's improved her ball-handling. She's a lot more complete player than she was when I coached her 10 years ago,"" he said.
Even with all of her accolades, Charles still has one major accomplishment missing from her resume: The seven-time All-Star has never won a WNBA championship. Though the Mystics are 7-8, they have also been  depleted by injuries. Two-time MVP Elena Delle Donne is still unable to play while she recovers from two back surgeries. Myisha Hines-Allen, a 2020 All-WNBA honoree, and Natasha Cloud, a 2019 All-Defensive selection, are also out with injuries.
The Mystics  will have some time to get healthy during the break while Charles and teammate Ariel Atkins travel to Tokyo to compete for Team USA in the Olympic Games. After the Olympic break, the Mystics have until mid-September to turn things around and give Charles a chance at that elusive title.
""I went into this saying to myself that I have things that I would like to accomplish before I retire,"" Charles said. ""I have more years behind me than ahead of me, and I just really appreciate and enjoy the game. I'm still in love with basketball. Every time I step on that court, I'm just having fun. I'm just being competitive, and just being very thankful to be able to play the game.""
The official WNBA store doesn't sell Charles' jersey. She didn't get the buzz of Diana Taurasi or Sue Bird when the USA's women's basketball roster for the Tokyo Games was announced. Her following on social media – 45,400 on Instagram – pales in comparison to the millions of followers that newer players like Kelsey Plum and Sabrina Ionescu have. 
Still, Charles doesn't believe she is underrated.
""I'm still getting doubled- and triple-teamed. I know that I'm very respected in this league,"" she said. ""I just leave it at that. As long as I have my peers' respect, that's all that matters to me.""

751,"Apr. 30 - Turkey is seeing a significant rebound in its crucial industry as foreign arrivals continue to gain pace and income continues to surge, as traces of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic continue to fade, Trend reports citing Daily Sabah.
The number of foreign visitors arriving in Turkey jumped over 151% from January through March from a year earlier to around 4.9 million, data showed Friday.
The figure well topped around 1.95 million arrivals in the January-March of last year and 4.24 million in 2020.
The arrivals still came in below 5.44 million foreign tourists who had arrived in the first quarter of 2019 prior to the outbreak of the pandemic.
Combined with Turkish citizens residing abroad, arrivals in the January-March quarter reached 6.3 million, Culture and Tourism Ministry said Friday, a 148.1% year-over-year increase.
Foreign arrivals in March leaped by 129.7% to nearly 2.1 million, the data showed.
Russians down, Ukrainians up
Iranians topped the list among nations with a share of 13.22%, followed by Germans with a 9% share and Bulgaria with 8.2%.
Arrivals from Russia dipped 48% year-over-year to 114,384. In contrast, the number of Ukrainians arriving in Turkey jumped nearly 30% to 66,233, the data showed.
Tourists coming in from the U.K., another crucial market for Turkey, boomed by 947% on annual basis in March to 87,349.
Yet, Treasury and Finance Minister Nureddin Nebati this week said holidaymakers arriving from Russia will not face difficulties in making payments in Turkey, as the Russian payment system continues to grow in the country.
Turkey is one of the few countries still operating direct flights with Russia.
Russians and Ukrainians were the country's first and third biggest sources of visitors, respectively, in 2021. Russians accounted for 19% of foreign visitors, with 4.7 million people, while Ukraine was the third-largest at 8.3% with 2.1 million people.
Income soars over 122%
Officials had hoped that with pandemic restrictions easing, tourism could replicate or exceed the numbers from 2019 when some 52 million visitors  -  including about 7 million Russians and 1.6 million Ukrainians  -  brought $34 billion (TL 504.83 billion) in revenue.
The number of foreign visitors soared 94.1% to 24.71 million and revenues doubled to almost $25 billion last year when COVID-19 measures were eased compared to 2020.
Nebati said he believed Turkey will exceed its target of 45 million tourists and $35 billion in tourism income this year.
Income in the January-March quarter jumped 122.4% year-over-year to $5.4 billion, the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) said on Friday.
Some 76.5% of this income, excluding GSM roaming and marina service expenditures, was obtained from foreign visitors and 23.5% came from the Turkish citizens resident abroad, it said in a statement.
In this quarter, foreign visitors visited Turkey mostly for ""travel, entertainment, sportive and cultural activities"" with 52.1%.
The average expenditure per night of the foreigners who stayed overnight was $75, while the average expenditure per night of Turkish citizens resident abroad was $51.
Tourism expenditure also increased by 181.3% compared to the same quarter of last year and reached $665 million.
The number of Turkish citizens who visited abroad increased by 269.6% to 1.03 million during the same period with an average expenditure was $640 per capit

What: Laramie County Fair
When: Now through Aug. 14, 10 a.m.-8 p.m.
Where: Archer Events Complex, 3801 Archer Parkway (east of Cheyenne, just south of Interstate 80)
Cost: Free admission to fair; weekend night events ticketed
Phone: 307-633-4670
Online: https://www.laramiecountyevents.com/fair/

CHEYENNE – This year’s Laramie County Fair kicked off this week almost like last year didn’t happen, County Events Director Dan Ange said Wednesday.
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic last year, the fair was held, but in a much more limited capacity. All of the weekend night events were scrapped, and while the county 4-H students participated, the fair was mostly closed to the public.
But not this year.
“We’re back open to the public,” Ange said. “I think the biggest thing is that we’re trying to build on what we started two years ago.”
In 2019, the fair officially moved all of its events to the Archer Events Complex, after years of splitting between the Archer fairgrounds for the 4-H showings and Frontier Park Arena for the night events.
This year’s fair, which began Wednesday, will run through Aug. 14.
There are no health restrictions at this year’s fair, but the Wyoming Department of Health is now recommending people, both unvaccinated and vaccinated against the virus, wear masks in public places.
The dog and horse shows began Wednesday, but Thursday and Friday activities will include the breeding shows, dairy goat shows and even a fashion revue.
“Last year, we condensed everything to one show ring, and we’ve actually kept that in place this year,” Ange said. “We have a lot of kids showing different species, so this way, people don’t have to choose between going to see hogs or steers at the same time.”
The fair’s exhibit hall will be open daily from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m., except for the final day, Aug. 14.
Free midway entertainment will be offered beginning Saturday until the end of the fair. These activities will include balloon twisting, magic shows, airbrush face painting, an inflatable zone, the ag-venture land and a laser maze and mini-golf.
Ange assured residents that the popular night events, such as the tractor pull, the motocross freestyle show, mutton busting, pig wrestling and the demolition derby will return this year. These are also the only events at the fair that require a ticket for admission.
The Hell on Wheels rodeo, which has been running most of the summer, will also be held over the two Saturdays of the fair at the Archer arena.
Contests taking place during the fair include: the lovable mutt (where Laramie County residents can show off their pooches in categories including longest tail and ears and biggest and smallest dog), fair fun poultry (open to anyone who has a healthy chicken, duck, goose or turkey that needs to be shown off), scarecrow, robot construction, apron and the stick horse race for kids ages 2 to 4, to name just a few.
Fiber arts workshops will also be held regularly throughout the next week. Additionally, a farmers’ market will be held Saturday from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.
The pandemic was good for one thing, Ange noted: he and his team started livestreaming the fair through its YouTube channel, LCF TV. They will continue to do so this year, and will also post regular updates to the fair’s Facebook page.","Laramie County Fair returns to normal this year, events director says"
758,"Dec. 3 - It was the biggest thing to happen to the Eastern Greene girls' basketball program since, well, Indy Workman's been there anyway.
The senior starting guard joined her teammates as they came back to the floor to a waiting mob of shouting schoolmates. And the Greene County Keg.
They lined up for photos, the Keg front and center as cell phones clicked, and lingered on the floor with parents and friends. It was just short of a sectional title afterglow Thursday night.
It was a trophy moment worth savoring at the beginning of a long season. Handing Linton, winner of the last two state titles in Class 2A, a gutsy 43-40 overtime defeat also got the Thunderbirds one step closer to a SWIAC title.
When Bradie Chambers' 3-point attempt banged off the front of the rim and was snagged by Kenli Sullivan, the buzzer soon sounded on Linton's first league loss since Jan. 26, 2017.
""I've believed in our girls for a long time,"" Eastern coach Greg Burton said. ""We said it in the locker room today, 'Once they believe they're as good as what we think they are, we're going to be tough to beat.
""And I think they bought in in the second half. It's the most prepared they've been for any game.""
It's probably why they were able to calm down so well once the ball was tipped.
""I was anxious,"" said Mia Uland, whose four free throws in the overtime were a clutch as anything. ""I was anxious all day. I was nervous. I had butterflies all day long, but I got here and was like, you know, it's kind of how much you want it. I wanted it.""
And the moment wasn't too big for a program that hasn't had a winning season since 2015-16 and is still without one of its best players due to injury.
""I don't think it was a scared nervous,"" Workman said. ""I think it was more of a we're nervous and excited to have an opportunity. We knew we had a chance. It was just if we were going to show out or not.""
The hunters have become the hunted. And they welcome that. Eastern was 2-22 four years ago, 9-17 in Burton's first year and knocked off-track by COVID last season.
""It feels good,"" Workman said. ""Because for four years of being the underdog, of, 'Oh, it's Eastern, let's get a win.' So it feels good to know we're someone they have to mess with now.""
Linton (7-3, 2-1) had to completely rebuild its starting lineup due to graduation and club volleyball commitments.
Still, the Miners are a well-coached bunch with a nose for the basketball. They won the glass, 41-33, and that included 19 offensive rebounds.
They needed the extra chances just to keep up on an unusually poor shooting night. Linton started off 2-of-15 in the first quarter and struggled to 26% (13-of-50) against Eastern's defense.
Still, there were several times were the game could have gotten away but each time, Eastern hung in like a state champion.
""A lot of preparation,"" Uland said. ""After the first quarter, when it was 12-6, we knew we belonged here.""
But Linton looked like it was going to take over in the second quarter.
It started with back-to-back 3s by Addisyn McKee and Sydney Jerrells (13 points) as part of a 13-2 run. But it was still just 19-16 at halftime and Linton massaged a five-point lead through the third quarter. It was 32-28 with 5:19 to go.
""Just the way we fought back,"" Burton said. ""Being down, we could have folded up multiple times. But we kept fighting. Perkins was hurt and stayed out there. Keylee with some huge buckets. Mia with some huge free throws. I could go down the line.""
A technical foul helped Eastern get within one, then Keylee Hudson drove and was fouled, completing a three-point play at 1:02 for a 35-33 lead.
Linton tried to press after tying it with 41 seconds to go, but Hudson took it right to the basket for 37-35 lead with 33 seconds left. Chambers drove for the tying score before Hudson's turnaround just rimmed out, sending the game into OT.
Things didn't start well for Eastern in the OT, with three missed 3s. But the Miners went 1-of-5 at the line to leave the door open.
Eastern hit five of its next six free throws, four by Uland, the first two giving her team that lead for good with 1:09 to go, 39-38.
""It was a lot of pressure,"" Uland said. ""We actually do a lot of pressure free throws in practice so I've been in that position. But it was definitely something that I'd never really experienced before.""
Eastern led 42-38 with 41 seconds left. Chambers scored and Eastern called timeout with 18 seconds to go.
Chambers stole the inbounds pass and sped toward the other end, but Uland poked the ball free and Perkins scooped up the loose ball and was fouled with 9.7 seconds left. She made only the second to set up the dramatic finish.
""It feels great,"" Workman said. ""When coach Burton got here, he changed the whole attitude of the program and made people respect us more.
""I think we were still a real underdog coming into this game. And I think it really made us get this game, our want and our will. We really wanted to prove to everyone.""

It also applies to high school and prep school teams in addition to youth hockey, but does not include college or pro teams. Junior teams, including the Maine Nordiques based in Lewiston and Twin City Thunder based in Auburn, have continued to play interstate games.
NHL: Joonas Korpisalo made 31 saves and Oliver Bjorkstrand had a goal and an assist, sending the Columbus Blue Jackets to a 2-1 win over the Blackhawks in Chicago.
• Minnesota Wild forward Kevin Fiala was suspended for three games without pay for boarding Los Angeles Kings defenseman Matt Roy.
BASEBALL
MLB: The St. Louis Cardinals are on the verge of acquiring Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado according to multiple reports, though Arenado has a no-trade clause and must approve the deal.
• Free agent outfielder Eddie Rosario, who spent the past six seasons with Minnesota, agreed to a one-year contract with Cleveland.
GOLF
PGA: Viktor Hovland birdied his final hole for a 7-under 65 on Torrey Pines’ tough South Course on a rainy, miserable day, giving him a one-shot lead after two rounds of the Famers Insurance Open in San Diego.
Hovland leads a group of six at 8 under, including first-round co-leader Patrick Reed and Jon Rahm, who won this tournament in 2017 and finished second to Marc Fleishman last year.
Reed shot an even-par 72 on the South Course after firing an 8-under 64 on the easier North Course. Rahm shot a 5-under 67 on the North Course.
Also at 8 under were Tony Finau, who had a 5-under 67 on the North; Ryan Palmer, who carded a 2-under 70 on the North; Adam Scott, who had a 3-under 69 on the South; and Lanto Griffin, who shot 2-under 70 on the South.
The weather is supposed to clear up for the weekend rounds on the South Course, which will host the U.S. Open in June for just the second time.
EUROPEAN TOUR: Tyrrell Hatton bounced back from an opening-round 76 with eight birdies and an eagle for an 8-under 64 to easily make the cut at the Dubai Desert Classic and move into contention for back-to-back titles.
Hatton, who won in Abu Dhabi last week to move up to a career-high No. 5 in the world, was 4 under overall – six strokes behind leader Thomas Detry (67). Robert MacIntyre (68) was a shot back in second place, with Tommy Fleetwood (68) in a three-way tie for third with Justin Harding (70) and Kalle Samooja (68).
• The Oman Open scheduled for March 4-7 on the European Tour has been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. It is the first event of the 2021 golf season lost to the pandemic.
The tour says the decision was made “following an announcement by the Omani government that all gatherings, international functions and sporting events are to be stopped in the country with immediate effect.”
The tour says organizers are looking into the possibility of rescheduling the tournament but “there are no definitive plans at this stage.”

OLYMPICS
TOKYO GAMES: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, despite growing uncertainty as coronavirus cases rise at home, renewed his determination to host the postponed Tokyo Olympics this summer as a symbol of human victory over the pandemic.
Suga, speaking from Tokyo at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, also called for a transparent investigation by the World Health Organization into the pandemic, saying it is key to learning lessons to prepare for future pandemics. He also promised to expand an initial $130 million contribution to a fund to help developing countries acquire coronavirus vaccines.
“We are holding the Olympics and Paralympics this summer,” Suga said. “I am determined to achieve the games as a proof of human victory against the pandemic, a symbol of global solidarity and to give hope and courage around the world.”
Olympic officials have repeatedly said the games will be held in July as planned after a one-year postponement, though various scenarios including the holding of events without spectators are being considered.
Suga repeated his resolve to achieve a “safe and secure” Olympics and pledged to get infections under control in Japan as soon as possible.
“We must learn lessons from this pandemic and be prepared for future crises,” he said. To do so, “a scientific investigation by WHO must be firmly carried out in a transparent way.” He did not say if he was referring to a current visit by a WHO team of experts to Wuhan, China, where the virus was first detected.
At home, Suga has been criticized for delaying virus measures until daily cases surged to new highs in late December. He eventually declared a partial state of emergency in early January, issuing non-binding requests through Feb. 7 for people to avoid crowds or eating out in groups and for restaurants and bars to close early.
New cases in Tokyo have dipped but experts say they have not slowed enough, indicating that the emergency measures could be extended for several more weeks.
SOCCER
MLS: Major League Soccer has extended its deadline for negotiating adjustments to the existing collective bargaining agreement until Feb. 4 and warned it is prepared to lock out players if a deal isn’t reached by then.
“Given the impact of COVID-19 on how clubs will need to operate during preseason, we must finalize an agreement in the coming days in order to provide teams and players adequate time to prepare for the opening of training camps,” the league said in a statement Friday.
The union proposed extending the current collective bargaining agreement through the 2026 season.
The league’s proposal includes playing players their full salaries in 2021 in exchange for an extension through the 2027 season.
“In our discussions with the MLSPA, we have emphasized the importance of the two-year extension to allow the league and clubs to recover a portion of the losses incurred in 2021 as a result of the pandemic while protecting the long-term health of the League by providing stability which promotes ongoing investment,” the league said.
MLS has said it lost nearly $1 billion last season due to the pandemic as it played in mostly empty stadiums and with increased costs for testing and charter flights. The league invoked a force majeure clause last month to reopen negotiations over the CBA, citing ongoing uncertainty because of the COVID-19 crisis.
The league’s new season is set to open April 3, with preseason training camps allowed to begin on Feb. 22.
HORSE RACING
HORSE OF THE YEAR: Kentucky Derby and Breeders’ Cup Classic winner Authentic was honored as Horse of the Year at the 50th annual Eclipse Awards on Thursday night.
The ceremony was held virtually because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Authentic received 224 out of 238 first-place votes. Monomoy Girl received seven votes. Swiss Skydiver, the filly who beat Authentic by a neck in the Preakness, finished third with six votes. Vekoma received one vote.
Trained by Hall of Famer Bob Baffert, Authentic also won 3-year-old male honors. The colt won five of seven starts last year, including a 1 1/4-length victory in the Kentucky Derby over odds-on favorite Tiz the Law. Another Baffert-trained colt, Improbable, won the Eclipse for older dirt male. A third Baffert trainee, 3-year-old Gamine, was honored as female sprinter of the year.
Baffert was nominated for trainer of the year, but lost to Brad Cox. Other human winners were: Irad Ortiz Jr. as jockey of the year; Alexander Crispin as apprentice jockey; Godolphin as owner of the year; WinStar Farm as the year’s top breeder.
SAILING
AMERICA’S CUP: American Magic has its back to the wall after losing its first two races in the best-of-seven semifinal match against Italy’s Luna Rossa in the America’s Cup challenger series.
It’s not an unfamiliar position.
The New York Yacht Club team has been on the back foot since its racing yacht Patriot capsized and came close to sinking during a round-robin race against Luna Rossa 12 days ago. The fact it was on the start line at all Friday was a triumph of its teamwork and determination.
As if it hadn’t been through enough, American Magic had to face what Luna Rossa helmsman Francesco Bruni described as “the hardest conditions in which we ever sailed these boats.”
The wind was constantly near the upper limit in which racing can take place in the 75-foot monohulls which race on narrow foils and are often on the very edge of balance and stability. Luna Rossa won Friday’s races by convincing margins of 2 minutes, 33 seconds and 3 minutes, 7 seconds.
American Magic had an especially nervous moment in the first of Friday’s two races when it came into the top mark at 61 mph and briefly lost control, flirting with disaster before continuing.
In a new trial, winds for the next two races on Saturday are expected to be close to the low end of the scale — between 6 and 9 knots — and American Magic will be tested again by a new extreme.
Skipper Terry Hutchinson was pressed after Friday’s race on what messages he might deliver to rally the U.S. team ahead of a day on which it could be eliminated from the America’s Cup regatta.
“I hate losing. It’s no more complicated than that,” he said. “Nothing gets you going more than having your teeth kicked in. That’s me personally. The message to the team is we can’t change a thing. They’ve done a really good job to get us this far and when I say not to change a thing we’re going to go and debrief our racing with a critical eye and come out a better sailing team tomorrow.”
SKIING
WOMEN’S WORLD CUP: The World Cup race planned Saturday in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany has been rescheduled due to weather conditions, meaning Sofia Goggia will take her four-race winning streak in downhill  to the world championships next month.
The International Ski Federation said Friday that the downhill cannot take place because difficult weather conditions at the German resort prevented a mandatory training run this week. The Garmisch weekend program is now super-G races on back-to-back days, with its downhill pushed back to Feb. 26 at Val Di Fassa, Italy.
Goggia has won four straight World Cup downhills, joining Lindsey Vonn as the only racers to achieve the feat in the past 25 years.
LUGE
WORLD CHAMPIONSHIPS: Germany won five of the nine available medals on the first day of luge’s world championships Friday in Konigssee, Germany, including a podium sweep in the women’s sprint race.
Julia Taubitz was first, Anna Berreiter second and Dajana Eitberger third for the Germans in the women’s sprint. Natalie Geisenberger was fourth, giving Germany a 1-2-3-4 finish. Summer Britcher was the top U.S. finisher, placing seventh.
In the doubles sprint, Germany’s Tobias Wendl and Tobias Arlt won the gold, followed by Latvia’s Andris Sics and Juris Sics, with Germans Toni Eggert and Sascha Benecken taking third.
The men’s sprint world title went to Austria’s Nico Gleirscher. In second place was Semen Pavlichenko, a Russian who competed as a neutral entrant because Russia is currently banned from using its name, flag and anthem at major events like Olympics and world championships as part of the sanctions from a doping scandal. Olympic champion David Gleirscher of Austria was third.
Tucker West was 12th in the men’s sprint for the U.S.
FIGURE SKATING
SYNCHRONIZED WORLDS: The International Skating Union has canceled the World Synchronized Skating Championships scheduled for April, but still plans to hold the individual worlds. The synchro event was set for Zagreb, Crotia on April 9-10.
Stockholm is scheduled to hold the world event for singles, pairs and ice dancers from March 22-28. American Nathan Chen would be seeking his third straight world title; the 2020 worlds were canceled due to the coronavirus pandemic.
“The ISU Council confirmed that the other pending ISU events of the 2020-21 season remain scheduled as planned, subject to pandemic developments and no quarantine requirements and or prohibitive/extensive entry restrictions,” the governing body said.
The 2021 worlds are particularly important because they serve as a qualification competition for the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing.
Additionally, the Grand Prix of Figure Skating calendar for next season has been approved. That series begins in October and concludes in December.
SKELETON
WORLD CUP: Latvia’s Martins Dukurs wrapped up his 10th World Cup men’s skeleton season championship Friday in Igls, Austria, without doing anything. Austria’s Janine Flock had to work a bit harder on the way to clinching her second season-long title.
Flock was second in the women’s skeleton World Cup season finale, more than good enough to give her the points crown. Flock also won the season-long title in 2014-15. Russia’s Elena Nikitina won the race, followed by Flock and Kimberley Bos of the Netherlands. Katie Uhlaender was 13th for the U.S., with Kendall Wesenberg 15th and Sara Roderick 16th in her World Cup debut.
Dukurs didn’t even race Friday and was still assured the season title since most other top contenders joined him in skipping the race to prepare for the world championships. They start next weekend in Altenberg, Germany. Dukurs has won the World Cup title in 10 of the last 12 seasons.

763,"
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve inched toward scaling back the easy-money policies adopted at the start of the pandemic by signaling that the process could start later this year.
The Fed cut its benchmark interest rate to near zero in March 2020 and has been purchasing at least $120 billion a month in Treasurys and mortgage bonds to provide extra stimulus to the economy. Officials since the end of last year said those purchases would continue until they see ""substantial further progress"" toward their goals of low unemployment and stable inflation.
Officials said in a statement Wednesday, at the conclusion of their two-day meeting, ""the economy has made progress toward these goals"" this year and indicated they would ""assess progress in coming meetings.""
That is a clue the Fed could outline plans to start reducing, or tapering, the purchases, later this year. The central bank's next meetings are scheduled for Sept. 21-22 and Nov. 2-3.
Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said at a virtual news conference Wednesday that the central bank was nowhere near considering plans to raise interest rates.
""It's not something that is on our radar screen right now,"" he said.
Stocks held steady after the Fed's statement.
The S&P 500 slipped 0.82 point, or less than 0.1%, to close at 4400.64. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose to 1.259% from 1.235% on Tuesday. Bond yields and prices move in opposite directions.
The Fed's statement modestly upgraded its assessment of the economy. ""With progress on vaccinations and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have continued to strengthen,"" it said.
The statement and Mr. Powell's comments after the meeting played down concerns about economic fallout from the spread of Covid-19's Delta variant, which has led to increasing cases among unvaccinated populations.
Mr. Powell said that while the variant could lead to significant public health problems, higher rates of vaccination and greater improvisation by consumers and businesses suggest, ""we've kind of learned to live with"" the virus.
That outlook suggested officials might be less inclined to dial up or extend their monetary support than they would have last year.
Officials deepened their deliberations Tuesday and Wednesday over how and when to begin tapering their asset purchases, Mr. Powell said. He offered few specifics. While officials want to see more hiring before pulling back on bond buying, ""there's a range of views on what timing will be appropriate,"" he said.
Officials also must consider the pace of any reductions. During a prior asset-purchase program that ended in 2014, the Fed shrank its purchases in modest, equal amounts over the course of 10 months. It then waited another 14 months before raising interest rates.
Mr. Powell said the Fed was likely to start reducing purchases of both types of assets at the same time, but he said it was possible officials could decide to taper the mortgage-bond acquisitions somewhat faster than Treasurys.
""Powell held his cards very close to his vest,"" said Nathan Sheets, a former Fed economist who is now at investment-advisory firm PGIM Fixed Income. ""That makes me think there's still not consensus in any way, shape or form"" on the Fed's rate-setting committee.
Some officials are concerned that a burst of inflation this year from bottlenecks associated with reopening the economy will prove more durable than previously anticipated. These policy makers are eager to start the taper, in part because they and their colleagues have said they would prefer to raise interest rates after they are done with asset purchases.
Another camp thinks recent price pressures will subside and could leave the Fed in the same position that it faced for much of the past decade, in which global forces kept inflation below 2% even with historically low interest rates. They are worried that accelerating plans to wind down the asset purchases could raise questions among investors about the Fed's commitment to achieving its economic goals.
Mr. Sheets said he expects inflation to return to the Fed's target by the end of 2022, putting him in the latter camp. But in a growing economy with extremely favorable borrowing costs and asset prices hitting records, he added, ""the case for buying $120 billion a month is weakening.""
""This is where Powell's leadership really matters. At the moment, you still could argue that as we learn to live with this virus, you should be able to do tapering by year-end,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at accounting firm Grant Thornton.
For a third straight month in June, inflation ran hotter than many economists had expected. The Labor Department's consumer-price index increased 5.4% from a year ago, the highest 12-month rate since August 2008.
Mr. Powell stuck to his longstanding view that recent surges in inflation are likely to fade over time. Supply-chain bottlenecks and other effects related to reopening the economy after the pandemic have driven inflation to higher levels than economists inside and outside the Fed expected this year. ""There's absolutely no sense of panic,"" Mr. Powell said. ""My best estimate is that this is something that will pass. . ..But we're actually responsible for this, though, so we have to take seriously the risk case, which is that inflation will be more persistent.""
Such a scenario could eventually put the central bank in the uncomfortable position of raising interest rates to cool down the economy before officials believe they've satisfied their goal to drive unemployment to low levels.
The Fed said last year it wanted inflation to run moderately above its 2% target to compensate for past periods of below-target inflation. Central-bank officials wanted to make sure consumers' and businesses' expectations of future inflation don't drift too low, and they pay close attention to these inflation expectations because they believe they can be self-fulfilling.
Officials had anticipated a strong labor market to gradually lift inflation higher. What the Fed now faces ""is a different thing,"" Mr. Powell said. The economy's ability to supply goods and services ""is not able to handle this big spike in demand that we're seeing.""

765,"  Innate to present new Phase 2 data on the combination of monalizumab, cetuximab and durvalumab in head and neck cancer in an oral presentation   ANKETTM to be highlighted in ESMO IO educational session   Investors  Innate Pharma  Henry Wheeler  Tel.: +33 761 88 38 74  Henry.wheeler@innate-pharma.fr  Media  Innate Pharma  Tracy Rossin (Global/US)  Tel.: +1 240 801 0076  Tracy.Rossin@innate-pharma.com  ATCG Press  Marie Puvieux (France)  Tel.: +33 (0)9 81 87 46 72  innate-pharma@atcg-partners.com  Regulatory News:  Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) announced today that it will present new data from the Phase 2 expansion cohort (‘cohort 3’) exploring the triplet combination of monalizumab, cetuximab and durvalumab, in first-line IO and chemo-naïve patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (R/M SCCHN) at the ESMO Immuno-oncology Congress 2021, being held virtually from December 8-11 2021.  Monalizumab, Innate’s lead partnered asset, is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.  Additionally, Pr. Eric Vivier, Ph.D., DVM, Chief Scientific Officer at Innate Pharma, will present in the NK cell biology educational session. Details can be found below.  Presentation Details:   Monalizumab: The oral presentation (#123MO) entitled, “Monalizumab, cetuximab and durvalumab in first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (R/M SCCHN): a phase 2 trial,” will be presented from 12:15-12:20 pm CET on December 9, 2021.   NK cells: Prof. Vivier will discuss Innate’s multi-specific NK cell engager platform, ANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics), in the educational session entitled, “NK cells biology and therapeutic opportunities, innate immunity, adaptive immunity” from 11:40 – 12 pm CET on December 9, 2021.   About Monalizumab:  Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.  NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E, cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may re-establish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies1.   AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab in October 2018 through a co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015. The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies.  About ANKETTM:  ANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate's proprietary platform for developing next-generation, multi-specific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. The Company’s latest innovation, its tetra-specific ANKETTM molecule, is the first NK cell engager technology to engage two NK cell-activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16), a tumor antigen and the interleukin-2 receptor (by an IL-2 variant, IL-2v), via a single molecule. This molecule leverages the advantages of harnessing NK cell effector functions against cancer cells and also provides proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells.  In pre-clinical studies, Innate's tri-2 and tetra-specific ANKETTM technologies promote potent NK cell activation, cytotoxicity and efficient control of tumor growth in pre-clinical models. This versatile fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer.  About Innate Pharma:  Innate Pharma S.A. is a global, clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.  Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical needs.  Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens, as well as antibody engineering. This innovative approach has resulted in a diversified proprietary portfolio and major alliances with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novo Nordisk A/S, Sanofi, and a multi-products collaboration with AstraZeneca.

766,"BLUFFTON - Back when Jeff Richards took over the Bluffton program six years ago he understood he needed to plant the seeds of success at the lower levels in order to produce winners in the future and instill a winning culture and it appears that move has paid off.
“Culture is a huge one,” Richard said. “This group of seniors when we took over as a staff were seventh graders and we told them the culture of the program was starting with them and they were going to carry that through their whole middle school and high school career so this is a group that we are very proud of their work everything and everything they put together.
“They don’t get satisfied and they look at their performance and they need to see where they need to improve. We are not where we want to be at but they know they how to work where they want to be.”
The Pirates have learned a lot of lessons the last several years. From 2016 to 2019, the Pirates were 15-26 overall and 8-20 in the NWC. But last year, the Pirates posted a winning season, going 5-3 and 3-2 in NWC play.
“You have growing pains and you don’t get the results you necessarily want right away and the same with society today where a lot of people want instant satisfaction and you don’t get that,” Richards added. “You have to work for it and fight through it and these kids have shown their resiliency over the years and have had some tough losses and now they are starting to experience the great wins.”
The Pirates learned a little about winning with three fourth quarter come-behind-wins and added a playoff victory last year and this season they have already produced an overtime win and pulled out a big win over Ayersville on the road last week.
The momentum has carried over and it doesn’t hurt when you have 24 returning letter winners and 10 starters back on offense.
The Pirates have opened by winning its first three games and will face Spencerville in the NWC opener Friday.
“I think we can connect to our good non conference start is we have a lot of experienced guys,” Richards said. “Last year we graduated one full time starter in Tyson Shutler who is now playing at Capital University but everyone else was underclassmen last year. A lot of that was at times out of necessity because of Covid issues and things like that. We brought in a big freshmen class so our depth especially on the scout team, a thing you take for granted when you have a big roster, so the quality of our practices is particularly higher.”
In its first three games, Bluffton has outscored its opponents 134-41, averaging 44.7 points a contest. The Pirates have produced 1,149 total yards, tops among NWC teams with 889 of those coming on the ground.
Pirate quarterback Nate Schaadt is the driving force behind the Pirates’ success in moving the football. The dual threat quarterback has passed for 260 yards and two touchdowns with three interceptions and has rushed for 581 yards, averaging 8.1 yards a carry, and 11 touchdowns.
“We are a spread triple option team so we want to run but we mix it up in how we are running the ball,” Richards said. “It is not your traditional inside zone or anything like that. A big part of our success is we run a complex offense and we throw the ball to get the guys open on the perimeter when they crowd the box.
“We are pretty balanced in our skilled positions and our offensive line has been doing fantastic lately and that led by Aaron Tabler our four year starter and all district performer and you know all the guys are going to go to Nate Schaadt for a good reason and I am so proud of the leadership role he has taken and the man he is becoming.”
Defensively, the Pirates are giving up an average of 13.7 points a contest. A big improvement over last year when Bluffton gave up an average of 42.6 points in six games last year.
Richards admits that last year the defense was an issue but said they put a big emphasis on defense with knowing responsibilities, executing and getting off the field on third and long and fourth downs.
“Our guys have really responded to that,” Richards said. “We have had some big fourth down stops the last two weeks. Against Pandora-Gilboa we had a huge stop in overtime to get the ball and then we sealed the game on offense. Up front, our d-lines has played very well and in the secondary we have had Beau Stever who has had multiple interceptions this year and a lot of guys who are veterans but still young.”
While the senior leadership is important, Richards adds that there is number of young players who have also stepped up to make this a more well rounded team.
“This group of seniors we put a challenge to them at the end of the season about leading the team and each one has stepped up and takes initiative in their own way but we also have some younger guys who have stood up,” Richards said. “The best for me is when the young guys and older guys interact and we don’t have too many egos in our program which is a great thing.”
Even with the fast start, Richards understand that the road gets much tougher with the start of the NWC. Two other teams, Columbus Grove and Crestview, are also unbeaten at 3-0, with Allen East and Delphos Jefferson sporting 2-1 marks and Spencerville, Leipsic and Ada all a 1-2.
“Every year our goal is to win the Northwest Conference,” Richards said. “That being said, the NWC is extremely competitive. Last year, Grove won it in the tournament but in the two years before that it was a three-way tie so that shows you how competitive the conference is.
“You can never take a game off….We know we have to be on our game every singe week and we know our kids have to be excited about the teams we are playing and the thing for us is we have had these years of growing so they can thing back a couple of years of when teams were putting it on them and they want to get a little revenge and experience and talent. It is a good conference to play in every single week.”

One concern relates to FAA's implementation of performance-based navigation (PBN), which may concentrate aircraft noise over a smaller area. As part of its effort to modernize air traffic control, FAA has been implementing PBN to allow aircraft to fly more precise flight paths intended to reduce flying time, fuel use, and emissions. Although, over time, FAA has increased its community outreach efforts throughout the PBN implementation process, FAA could improve its outreach to communities about noise concerns both before and after PBN changes.In particular, FAA uses the Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) metric to meet legal requirements in assessing how these more precise flight paths might affect noise levels at various locations surrounding airports. However, this metric does not provide a clear picture of the flight activity or noise levels at a given location. DNL takes multiple components of aircraft noise into account, including the amount of noise from each flight and the average number of flights per day at a given location. Because of this, the same DNL may be associated with vastly different numbers of flights above that location. Small numbers of relatively loud operations, for example, can result in the same DNL as large numbers of quieter operations, as shown below. As a result, information on potential noise impacts FAA provided during outreach efforts--which was grounded in DNL--was not clear enough for communities to understand the planned changes.Furthermore, after implementing PBN, FAA primarily conducts outreach through community forums established to address noise concerns. However, members of some forums GAO spoke with were frustrated and unclear on how to productively engage with FAA to address noise concerns. FAA had provided some public guidance on this process, but it was unclear about the extent to which communities can expect assistance from FAA in proposing changes to flight paths that cause noise concerns.To improve FAA's efforts to assess noise impacts and engage with affected communities, in September 2021, GAO recommended that FAA (1) identify additional metrics for assessing the noise impacts of new flight paths, (2) incorporate additional tools to clearly convey expected impacts, such as other noise metrics and visualization tools, and (3) improve guidance for communities on effectively engaging with FAA. FAA expects to take steps toward implementing these recommendations by the end of 2022. Implementing these improvements can help FAA more effectively understand the effects of aircraft noise and address community concerns as the nature and extent of operations in the national airspace system continue to evolve and increase.View GAO-22-105844.

It can potentially expose residents to a variety of negative effects, such as disrupted sleep and health issues, and spur community objections to airport operations and growth. FAA has a responsibility to balance the growing demand for aviation capacity against the effects of aircraft noise on the environment and communities. It works to address noise concerns by (1) ensuring that aircraft meet federal noise standards, (2) assessing potential noise effects of proposed flight path changes, and (3) conducting community outreach on the potential noise impacts of such changes, among other efforts.This statement describes FAA's efforts to engage with communities on aircraft noise concerns related to PBN implementation, among other issues. It is based largely on GAO's 2020 and 2021 work on aviation noise, including GAO-21-103933. To update this work, GAO reviewed information from FAA on its efforts to implement GAO's recommendations.What GAO RecommendsGAO made several recommendations in prior reports, including that FAA develop and use supplemental noise metrics, improve community engagement efforts, and enhance information sharing. FAA expects to take steps to implement them by the end of 2022. Continued attention is needed to ensure they are fully addressed.LetterChair Larsen, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the Subcommittee:Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on our body of work related to aircraft noise. While airports provide access to transportation for millions of people each day, aircraft noise can be disruptive to communities. It can potentially expose residents to a variety of negative effects, such as disrupted sleep and increased risk for cardiovascular disease,1 and spur community objections to airport operations and continued growth. Despite trends toward increasingly quieter airplanes, community concerns about noise have persisted, particularly with regard to changing flight paths around airports as part of the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) efforts to modernize the national airspace. Moreover, new entrants to the national airspace--such as uncrewed aircraft systems, commonly known as drones--may further contribute to challenges with aviation noise issues. In coordination with stakeholders, FAA works to address noise concerns by conducting research on aircraft noise impacts, ensuring that aircraft meet federal noise standards, overseeing and funding airport noise mitigation projects, and conducting community outreach related to potential noise effects of proposed changes to the national airspace, among other efforts.My testimony today is based largely on reports we issued in 2020 and 2021 related to aircraft noise.2 Specifically, this testimony primarily describes: (1) the transition of the U.S.-based commercial fleet to quieter airplanes and (2) FAA efforts to engage with communities to understand and address aircraft noise concerns. To conduct our prior work, we reviewed relevant statutes and regulations. We also reviewed FAA documents on its application of aircraft noise standards, environmental impact analysis and community engagement practices in relation to the agency's implementation of performance-based navigation (PBN)./3We interviewed FAA officials and a range of industry and community stakeholders to discuss their perspectives on the impacts of aircraft noise and efforts to address it. More detailed information on our objectives, scope, and methodology can be found in each of the reports. For this statement we collected and reviewed updated information from FAA on its efforts to implement recommendations we made in our 2021 reports.We conducted the work on which this testimony is based in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on audit objectives. We believe the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.Background FAA has an ongoing responsibility to balance the growing demand for aviation capacity against the environmental concerns and effects on communities caused by aircraft noise, whether that noise is caused by airplanes, helicopters, or new entrants to the national airspace. To address these concerns, FAA regulates aircraft noise by ensuring compliance with relevant noise standards through its aircraft certification process. FAA is also charged with implementing and enforcing limitations on the noise-related restrictions airports may place on aircraft operations (such as limiting certain types of planes) as well as noise standards for airports' noise mitigation projects that can receive federal funding./4FAA administers two programs--the Airport Improvement Program and Passenger Facility Charge program--that may fund airports' noise mitigation projects, including sound insulation of homes and other buildings near airports as well as land acquisitions. We last reported on these programs in 2012.5 In addition to FAA, airports, airlines, and other stakeholders have a role in addressing aircraft noise. For instance:* Most airports are owned and operated by public authorities, such as cities, counties, or port authorities, which have primary responsibility for addressing community concerns about noise. Airports help FAA identify noise sensitive communities as well as participate in mitigation efforts such as funding the installation of sound insulation in homes and buildings exposed to significant aircraft noise. Also, collecting and addressing noise complaints is a shared responsibility between FAA and the airport authorities. Airport authorities generally do not have control over many of the causes of aviation noise such as the types of aircraft in service and traffic volume (generally controlled by airlines) or flight paths (generally controlled by FAA, in coordination with airlines).* Airlines have a role in addressing aircraft noise concerns by, for example, coordinating with airports and FAA air traffic controllers to participate in voluntary airport noise abatement procedures or by transitioning their fleets to include newer, quieter aircraft.* FAA has collaborated with helicopter industry groups to develop and update ""Fly Neighborly"" procedures and guidance, a voluntary set of guidelines that identify helicopter noise mitigation practices.Most Commercial Airplanes Are Quieter Than RequiredFAA issues what is known as a ""type certificate"" as part of a certification process for new aircraft designs to signify that the design is in compliance with applicable airworthiness, noise, and other standards. Airplanes are certificated to the noise standards that were in effect at the time of the type certificate application. In August 2020 we reported that, based on FAA data and GAO estimates, most U.S. large commercial jet airplanes were certificated at the minimum required stage 3 noise standards, but nearly all of them would be able to meet more stringent noise standards./6By analyzing January 2020 data from airlines and aviation manufacturers, we estimated that 96 percent of large commercial airplanes were manufactured with technologies that are able to meet more recent and stringent stage 4 or 5 standards. According to FAA officials and aviation stakeholders we interviewed, the primary reason many large commercial airplanes certificated as stage 3 produce lower than stage 3 noise levels is because engine and airframe technology has outpaced the implementation of noise standards. More recently, in response to the decrease in travel amid the COVID-19 pandemic, some airlines have accelerated retirement of certain airplanes, some of which are certificated as stage 3. For example, one airline told us it is retiring its MD-88 fleet--which constitutes the majority of its remaining stage 3 fleet--and MD-90 fleet.Stakeholders we interviewed generally agreed that a government-mandated transition (i.e. phase-out) of stage 3 airplanes would not substantially reduce airport noise and could be costly and challenging. Since most U.S. large commercial jet airplanes are certificated at the minimum required stage 3 noise standards, a phase-out could require recertificating them to comply with stage 4 or 5 standards. This process could be costly for operators and manufacturers but would provide little reduction in noise since we found that nearly all of those aircraft already meet the more stringent noise standards. Further, airplanes currently unable to meet more stringent standards would require modifications or face retirement. For older airplanes that could not be recertificated to meet stage 4 or 5 standards, some operators could incur costs for replacement airplanes sooner than originally planned. Although stakeholders indicated that a phase-out would not substantially reduce noise, they identified other limited benefits newer airplanes generate, such as reduced greenhouse gas emissions and fuel consumption./7In addition, some stakeholders noted that factors other than noise from stage 3 airplanes are key contributors to airport noise in recent years. Such factors include a large increase in the number and frequency of flights at some commercial airports in recent years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and changes to flight paths raising community noise concerns.Looking to the future, emerging technologies may present opportunities to further reduce aircraft noise. For example, as we reported in November 2020, companies are developing innovative new aircraft designs, including electrically powered aircraft and aircraft with vertical takeoff and landing capabilities./8Among these potential future developments is the concept of advanced air mobility, which is expected to take advantage of the potential lower operating costs of electrified aircraft in support of moving people and cargo more quickly between local, regional, and urban places. According to FAA, significant technological improvements are expected to enable electrically powered aircraft that will reduce noise traditionally associated with helicopter transportation./9Additional Information and Communication Could Help FAA Better Understand Noise Impacts and Engage With CommunitiesAs directed in the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, FAA has continued modernizing the national airspace through NextGen, a multi-billion dollar effort to implement technologies and capabilities, including PBN, which relies on satellite navigation./10PBN is intended to allow aircraft to fly more precise flight paths intended to reduce flying time, fuel use, and emissions. The precision and predictability of PBN procedures increase safety and may allow more planes to safely fly in a given airspace at the same time or in closer succession, which in turn would allow for increased airspace capacity if demand increases. However, because PBN flight procedures are more precise, noise is likely to be concentrated over a smaller area. As a result, while fewer communities overall may experience noise, those communities directly under new PBN flight paths may experience more frequent noise. Community concerns about increased noise after PBN implementation, among other factors, have led to legal challenges and delays, reducing the realized benefits of PBN.As we reported in 2021, using additional metrics to assess the potential noise impacts of proposed PBN flight path changes may provide FAA with a better understanding of such impacts./11Currently, FAA assesses the potential noise impact of proposed flight path changes (such as PBN procedures) on locations within the area surrounding an airport by using the Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) metric./12Our analysis showed that because DNL takes into account both the amount of noise from each aircraft operation, as well as the average annual flights per day at a given location, the same DNL may be associated with vastly different numbers of flights above that location. As such, DNL does not provide a clear picture of the flight activity or associated noise levels at a given location. For example, as shown in figure 1, 100 flights per day can yield the same DNL as one flight per day at a higher decibel level.Figure 1: Different Numbers of Flights and Sound Exposure Levels Result in a Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL) of 65 DecibelsFigure omitted: https://transportation.house.gov/imo/media/doc/Krause%20Testimony.PDFNote: Sound exposure level (SEL) is a measure of the acoustic energy (that is, the sound pressure) of an individual noise event as if that event had occurred within a one-second time period.a Decibel (dB): A measure of sound intensity, or loudness.b Day-Night Average Sound Level (DNL): A cumulative measure of aircraft noise exposure at a particular location.This analysis as well as recent research published by FAA demonstrate the limitations of FAA relying solely on DNL to identify potential noise impacts. In January 2021, FAA issued the results of a survey showing a substantial increase in the percentage of people who are highly annoyed by aircraft noise, including at lower DNL levels, as compared to earlier survey results. According to FAA, one factor that may have contributed to this increase is changes to the nature of noise exposure, such as changes to the number of flights overhead. Since no single metric can convey different noise effects, using additional metrics--such as changes in number of flights overhead--in designing proposed flight paths could help FAA identify and address potential noise concerns and better facilitate PBN implementation. We recommended that FAA identify appropriate supplemental noise metrics and circumstances for their use to aid in FAA's internal assessments of noise impacts related to proposed PBN flight path changes. As of March 2022, FAA said it is conducting a noise policy review and plans to consider whether and under what circumstances supplemental, companion, or alternative noise metrics are appropriate to inform research and policy considerations. FAA plans to complete their initial noise policy review by the end of 2022.Over time, FAA has increased its community outreach efforts through the PBN implementation process. For example, at locations where PBN was implemented first, FAA only conducted briefings with airport officials. For later locations, however, FAA started to conduct more outreach with members of the public, including public workshops and webinars among other outreach activities. However, FAA could improve the public outreach it conducts prior to implementing PBN procedures. We reported that most community stakeholders said the information FAA provided on potential noise impacts during outreach efforts throughout the PBN-implementation process was not clear enough to understand the planned changes. For instance, because FAA described the impacts in terms of DNL, communities may not have had the information needed to understand how the number of flights over each location was expected to change. We recommended that FAA update guidance to incorporate additional communication tools that more clearly convey expected impacts, such as other noise metrics and visualization tools related to proposed PBN implementation. As of March 2022, FAA said it plans to update guidance on community outreach by the end of 2022.FAA has also faced challenges in its outreach after implementation of PBN procedures. After implementing PBN, FAA primarily conducted outreach through community forums established to address noise concerns. However, members of some forums we spoke with were frustrated and unclear on how to productively engage with FAA to address noise concerns. FAA had provided some public guidance on this process, but it was unclear about the extent to which communities could expect assistance from FAA in proposing changes to flight paths that cause noise concerns. For example, FAA's guidance advises that FAA's Air Traffic Organization can provide technical expertise on airspace procedural design when requested, but is unclear about the extent of the assistance available. We recommended that FAA provide clearer information to airports and communities on what communities can expect from FAA related to post-implementation outreach, including the technical assistance FAA can provide. As of March 2022, FAA said it plans to develop an appropriate process and post-implementation outreach tools by the end of 2022.In addition to its PBN-related outreach, FAA has established positions within regional offices and headquarters to collect and respond to community complaints about aircraft noise. Within the Office of Policy, International Affairs, and Environment, the Aviation Noise Ombudsman serves as a public liaison for questions and complaints related to aircraft noise./13Additionally, in response to a requirement in the FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018, FAA established the Community Engagement Officer position within each of FAA's nine regional offices to serve as a regional ombudsman and coordinate public outreach with the appropriate FAA officials./14As we reported in 2021, FAA officials told us the agency seeks to respond to and address the noise complaints it receives, and complaints are generally forwarded to the appropriate regional offices./15Related to helicopter noise complaints in particular, in 2021 we reported how FAA and industry stakeholders collect and respond to helicopter noise concerns in the Washington, D.C. area./16According to FAA data for 2017 through 2019, over 50 helicopter operators conducted approximately 88,000 helicopter flights within the D.C. area, though limited data on noise from these flights existed./17While FAA and operators reported taking steps to address public concerns on helicopter noise in the D.C. area, the ability of FAA and operators to address noise issues in the D.C. area was impeded because they did not consistently or fully share the information needed to do so. FAA receives and responds to complaints on helicopter noise from the public through its Noise Ombudsman and had recently developed online forms that improved FAA's ability to identify and respond to helicopter noise issues. However, according to nearly all of the 18 operators we interviewed, FAA had not communicated with them about helicopter noise or forwarded complaints to them. According to FAA, this was due to limitations on personally identifiable information on complainants that FAA can disclose to private operators. Similarly, operators often received noise complaints from the public that were not directed to the correct operator, but they did not typically share these complaints with FAA. As a result, operators had not consistently responded to residents' inquiries about helicopter noise and activity. For example, Fairfax County Police Department officials estimated that over 80 percent of noise complaints they received were unrelated to their flights, and thus they were unable to determine the source of the noise that spurred the complaint.We recommended FAA develop a mechanism to exchange helicopter noise information with operators in the D.C. area. As of March 2022, FAA officials said they were working to identify a mechanism to share complaint data with helicopter operators in the area. FAA officials also stated that they plan to conduct quarterly meetings in the area with local helicopter operators to examine trends in helicopter complaint data and discuss helicopter noise mitigation efforts. FAA officials said they plan to begin holding and facilitating these meetings in spring 2022. Although our work related to helicopter noise focused on the Washington D.C. area, other cities may experience similar concerns about heavy helicopter traffic and, in general, seeking to increase communication among FAA, operators, and stakeholders may assist in addressing their concerns.As FAA continues in its efforts to expand the use and types of uncrewed aircraft systems and other emerging technologies into the national airspace system, these new aircraft could present new noise challenges. For example, electric take-off and landing vehicles have the potential for quieter operations but may also operate closer to populations and raise new concerns for communities. FAA stated in 2020 that stakeholder concerns about noise will need to be considered when designing corridors (defined airspace) where these aircraft might operate./18In addition, continued growth in commercial space launches is expected, but as we reported in 2020, stakeholders have expressed concerns that FAA's process for licensing launch sites may not adequately consider combined noise effects of commercial space activities with aviation activities on surrounding communities./19Assessing and addressing community noise concerns will be critical as the nature and extent of aircraft operations continues to evolve and increase. Fully implementing our prior recommendations can help FAA more effectively understand the effects of aircraft noise and address community concerns.Chair Larsen, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared remarks. I would be pleased to respond to any questions that you may have at this time.* * *Footnotes:1 M. Basner, C. Clark, A. Hansell, J. I. Hileman, S. Janssen, K. Shepherd, and V.

PBN procedures enable aircraft to fly a particular flight path more precisely, so aircraft will be closer to the ""center line"" of a flight path than when using conventional navigation procedures. Our work for GAO-21-103933 focused on PBN implementation at both metroplex projects (major metropolitan areas with multiple airports and complex air traffic patterns for which FAA has redesigned the airspace and deployed PBN procedures for several airports concurrently) and single-site airports (individual airports for which FAA has designed PBN procedures).4 FAA administers Airport Noise and Access Restrictions (14 CFR Part 161) and Airport Noise Compatibility Planning (14 CFR Part 150). Part 161 requires that certain airport operators receive approval from FAA to implement noise restrictions related to certain aircraft. Through the Part 150 program, FAA provides guidance to airports on the types of land uses that are incompatible with certain levels of airport noise and provides a process for airports to develop noise compatibility programs to reduce and prevent such uses. Airports that participate in this voluntary program can receive funding from FAA through the Airport Improvement Program for noise mitigation projects such as soundproofing buildings.5 GAO, AIRPORT NOISE GRANTS: FAA Needs to Better Ensure Project Eligibility and Improve Strategic Goal and Performance Measures, GAO-12-890 (Washington, D.C.: Sept. 12, 2012).6 See GAO-20-661. FAA classifies airplanes that meet the various noise standards into 5 stages. Airplanes classified as stages 1 and 2 (the noisiest aircraft) have been prohibited by regulation and statute respectively from operating in the United States. Airplanes operating today in the United States--classified as stages 3, 4, or 5--are much quieter. The Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990 required large jet airplanes to comply with stage 3 noise standards by 1999, leading to a phase-out of the noisiest airplanes (stage 1 and 2 airplanes). Pub. L. No. 101-508, Sec. 9308, 104 Stat. 1388. Additionally, in 2013, FAA promulgated a rule in response to Section 506 of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 that required smaller airplanes to comply with stage 3 standards by 2016.

Sec. 91.881); FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012, Pub. L. No. 112-95, Sec. 506, 126 Stat. 11, 105.7 At the time of our 2020 report, the U.S. commercial airplane fleet was younger and quieter when compared to the last time the federal government mandated a transition to quieter aircraft. For example, according to February 2020 data we reviewed for passenger and cargo airlines, the average age of the passenger airplane fleet was approximately 12 years, and for the cargo fleet, about 21 years. In comparison, in 2001, we reported that the average age of passenger and cargo airplane fleet was approximately 26 and 31 years old, respectively.

L. No. 112-95, Sec. 213, 126 Stat. 11, 46-50.11 See GAO-21-103933.12 DNL is expressed in decibels (dB), which measure the intensity (or loudness) of a sound. The higher the decibel level, the more intense the sound, and the louder it will be perceived. The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended, implementing regulations, and FAA's implementing Order require FAA to examine the potential impacts associated with a major federal action, including potential noise impacts. As a result, operational changes, such as changes to flight paths, as well as airport development proposals, such as adding new runways or otherwise expanding capacity, must be reviewed to identify potential noise effects.13 The Ombudsman was established by the Federal Aviation Reauthorization Act of 1996. Pub. L. No. 104-264, Sec. 1210, 110 Stat. 3213 (codified at 49 U.S.C. Sec. 106(q)).14 The FAA Reauthorization Act of 2018 required FAA to designate a regional ombudsman for each of FAA's regions. Pub. L. No. 115-254, Sec. 180, 132 Stat. 3186, 3230. In addition to the regional noise ombudsmen, FAA also has a noise ombudsman, which is a separate national position that serves as a liaison with the public on issues regarding aircraft noise. FAA has also formed a Noise Complaint Initiative group consisting of representatives from across FAA with the goal of more efficiently and effectively responding to and addressing noise complaints.15 For additional information, see GAO-21-103933 regarding the handling of noise complaints related to airports and GAO-21-200 regarding the handling of noise complaints related to helicopters.16 See GAO-21-200.17 The D.C. area was defined in our report as the area within 30 miles of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.18 Federal Aviation Administration, Concept of Operations, v1.0: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) (Washington, D.C.: June 26, 2020).19 GAO, COMMERCIAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION: FAA Should Examine a Range of Options to Support U.S. Launch Infrastructure, GAO-21-154 (Washington, D.C.: Dec. 22, 2020).MSTRUCK-7783288 MSTRUCK",House Transportation Subcommittee Issues Statement From GAO Director Krause

flights halted, events in limbo
New restrictions are being pondered  globally
The coronavirus pandemic continued to scramble Americans' plans on the day after Christmas, with more than 1,000 flights canceled and virus-related absences and soaring case rates leaving many gatherings and events in limbo. 
With cases also rising sharply around the globe, several European countries have announced new restrictions, and Israel said it would launch a study Monday of whether a fourth vaccine shot could be effective.
Many of the U.S. flight cancellations occurred on Delta, United, SkyWest, American and JetBlue airlines, according to the flight-tracking company Flight-Aware. The service said at least 1,212 flights within or going to or from the United States were canceled as of Sunday midafternoon - not a record-setting amount, but enough to make traveling difficult. Another 997 U.S. flights  had been canceled on Saturday, the service said.
""These are the kind of numbers you'd see if it was a massive blizzard on Christmas Day,"" said David Slotnick, who covers the aviation industry for the Points Guy, a travel website. For comparison, he said that there are about 200 cancellations on a typical day. ""There's been some winter weather in Seattle and Salt Lake City, but the reality here is the large amount of covid.""
The airlines said the cancellations were mainly prompted by employees who tested positive for coronavirus, requiring them to quarantine for 10 days. Airline officials have called on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to cut that time to five days, joining an array of industries expressing concern that the highly transmissible omicron variant of the virus has made it impossible to maintain needed staffing levels.
Anthony S. Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden and the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said Sunday that he would welcome a requirement that airline passengers be vaccinated, while stressing that masks and air filtration has made it safe for people to be on airplanes.
""Anything that could get people more vaccinated would be welcome,"" Fauci said on ABC's ""This Week."" ""But with regard to the spread of virus in the country, I mean, I think if you look at wearing a mask and the filtration on planes, things are reasonably safe.""
Across the country, thousands of travelers, some of whom for months had planned to visit with friends and family, learned that their flights were canceled, leading to a cascade of frantic telephone calls and online efforts to  rebook to reunite.
Ashley Goldsmith, 34, a content strategist in San Francisco, decided in October that she'd put a big wedding on hold and instead is getting married at City Hall, surrounded by close friends and family in late December after the Christmas holiday.
Now she's anxiously hoping even that plan comes together: Her father and sister, who were supposed to fly in from New York on Christmas Day, have had their flight canceled twice. They were scheduled to leave Sunday night.
""If the cancellations keep happening, how many times do we reschedule before we just say, 'Maybe it's not going to happen?'"" she said. ""If I had known what omicron was going to be like and if I had known it was going to be impacting flights and things like that, I might have thought twice about all of it.""
Katherine Duggan, 32, a psychology professor at North Dakota State University, missed a lamb Christmas dinner with family in the Los Angeles area, after cancellations on both Friday and Saturday. She now hopes to get to California on Tuesday.
""I humbly request that you set aside some of the lamb,"" Duggan told her aunt on Christmas, speaking with relatives via video call while making do with Indian takeout. ""I can set it aside,"" her aunt replied. ""But I can't guarantee it will last until you make it to town.""
Boston College senior Matt Owens, 22, had a different kind of problem. He set out from his home in Kansas City at 3:45 a.m. Sunday on a mission: making it to the 2021 Military Bowl in Annapolis on Monday to watch his school face off against East Carolina University.
As his D.C.-bound plane took off from Chicago, he learned the game had been canceled due to a shortage of players, due in part to the virus. He booked a 6:30 p.m. flight back home, which ended up delayed at least two hours.
""A very, very long day of technically accomplishing nothing,"" Owens said, somehow still sounding chipper. ""It's just kinda life, and you've got to deal with it sometimes. Sad it happened. We were all excited for the game. But wish all the players best of luck in recovery.""
Poor weather at airports in the West, including Portland International Airport, Seattle-Tacoma International Airport and Salt Lake City International Airport, also impacted flight schedules.
Gemma Millar, 43, sat on the tarmac for more than five hours while her Alaska Airlines flight from Seattle tried to deal with icy weather. Then she was told the plane had burned through so much fuel that it had to return to the terminal.
""I have no idea honestly what is going to happen,"" said Millar, who was trying to get home to Florida after visiting her sister for Christmas. ""At this point, I just want to get off the plane.""
Delta Air Lines had canceled 161 flights out of the 4,155 scheduled by Sunday afternoon, after scrapping more than 580 flights on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. United Airlines canceled nearly 100 flights related to staffing shortages, out of more than 4,000 flights scheduled.
American Airlines canceled at least 76 flights and delayed more than 370 others as of Sunday afternoon, according to FlightAware. A company spokesperson referenced the airline's Christmas Day statement citing ""COVID-related sick calls"" as the cause of some cancellations.
""Airlines were already pretty thin in terms of their labor numbers,"" said Scott Keyes, founder of Scott's Cheap Flights. ""Think of a school that just has one substitute teacher, and then all of a sudden, three or four of the main teachers get sick and have to quarantine.""
The Transportation Security Administration reported that a total of 5.4 million people went through security screening at airports from Dec. 23 through Dec. 25. That's more than double the same period last year, but still not reaching the travel levels of 2019.
Brett Thorson, 45, felt lucky that his direct redeye flight from Honolulu to Dulles International Airport was not canceled. But when he saw how many people on Sunday morning were squeezed into the ""mobile lounges"" - which take people between terminals at Dulles - he cringed.
In nearby Maryland, the number of cases and positivity rate jumped over the holiday weekend, with the state reporting 5,826 new cases Sunday and a positivity rate of 15.8 percent - up from 10.8 percent a week ago.
He and his wife and 13-year-old son all took rapid tests after getting back to their home in Alexandria. All were negative, but he said they plan to mostly hang out inside for the next few days, just in case. ""I am still worried that covid is inside and just kind of getting its hooks in me,"" Thorson said. ""If I had the option, I would have stayed in Honolulu.""
In  D.C., travelers at Union Station reported no unusual delays on Amtrak and said they were trusting their masks and vaccines to keep them safe.
""You just have to be careful,"" said Alfredo Correa, 60, who had flown from Los Angeles with his wife and teenage daughters to spend Christmas in Washington with family. On Sunday, they were boarding a train for New York. ""We're all boosted, and we just make sure everybody is masked. It's just common sense.""
D.C.'s public coronavirus testing sites, which were flooded with residents who wanted tests before holiday travel last week, shut down for the Christmas holiday on Friday and Saturday.
On Sunday, one limited option reopened: Residents could pick up free rapid antigen tests at four firehouses in the city, so they could test themselves at home. Before the firehouses opened at noon, some residents were ready waiting in lines that stretched for blocks.
The city's other testing options will resume Monday, including PCR tests administered by medical professionals at firehouses and other public locations. Residents will be able to pick up the free rapid tests at eight libraries, which will each have 2,000 tests available per day and will offer up to four tests, or two kits, per resident. Residents can also pick up PCR tests for testing themselves at home at additional libraries and public buildings. Those PCR tests must be returned to a dropbox to be processed by a lab, which can take several days.
In New York, the skyrocketing number of infections has outpaced the increase in hospitalizations and deaths so far, the city's health department reported on Friday. While the city's seven-day average of confirmed and probable coronavirus cases has climbed to 12,613 - a nearly 10-fold increase from a month ago - physicians say that many cases are leading to only mild symptoms in people who previously were vaccinated.
Public health experts said they were relying on patchwork data to gauge the national effects of the omicron surge, as most states did not report daily coronavirus cases across the Christmas holiday weekend. They also expect that many Americans relying on at-home rapid tests will not submit those results to local health departments, further clouding efforts to track the outbreak.
In Europe, France's rise in reported cases has been among the highest, with over 100,000 daily coronavirus infections for the first time since the coronavirus emerged in China. French President Emmanuel Macron will hold emergency meetings Monday to go over next steps to contain the virus. A draft law pushed by the government would require proof of vaccination to enter public venues and restaurants.
In Ireland, where Dec. 26 is the biggest day of the year for household get-togethers, the chief medical officer warned citizens not to gather and to shop online instead of visiting stores, the Associated Press reported. In Belgium, the government closed cultural venues such as movie theaters and concert halls, sparking protests by artists and event organizers. The Netherlands has implemented a partial lockdown, closing down bars, restaurants and all nonessential stores as well as extending the school break.
China reported 158 new cases of local coronavirus transmission, a record number since last January, according to Bloomberg News. The last time China reported domestic infections was mid-October.
On Monday, Sheba Medical Center in central Israel will begin a trial study of 150 medical personnel to determine whether administering a fourth coronavirus vaccine shot safely boosts immunity. Israel recently announced that it would be the first in the world to offer a fourth vaccine to citizens 60 and older, the immunocompromised and health-care workers. The campaign is waiting for approval  from Ministry of Health Director Nachman Ash and is being debated by the medical community, which cites a lack of scientific evidence behind the decision.

",Travel hits the covid wall
773,"Mar. 24Greg Compton will have a lot of think time  five hours a day  as he treks 15 miles daily along roadsides until he's covered the full length of Indiana, from north to south.
He'll ponder how his late father was born with severely deformed legs that turned upward, without functional ankles and with club feet. Robert Neal Compton's parents, poor farmers in Bourbon, took the lad to Riley Hospital for Children in Indianapolis, where, thanks to nearly 20 operations that stretched into his early adulthood, he was able to walk and work.
But, while listening to tunes and enjoying the outdoors, Compton will mostly think about  and pray for  the kids whom Riley helps today.
""Bottom line: It's for the kids now,"" the 67-year-old says from his Plymouth home.
This 260-mile fundraising trek for Riley has stewed in Compton's mind for years. Retirement from his banking job in December gave him the precipice from which to leap. He'll embark at 9 a.m. April 5 from a Dairy Queen on Michigan 51 just north of the Michigan-Indiana state line. He'll stop April 15 at Riley in Indianapolis and finish April 24 at the George Rogers Clark Memorial Bridge (he calls it a ""big yellow bridge"") that links Jeffersonville, Ind., to Louisville, Ky.
He is seeking donations. Along the way, people may spy a special 1-by-2-foot flag about hiking for Riley that he'll dangle from his backpack. If someone inquires, he'll hand out a small card on how they can contribute.
Getting noticed. It partly explains why he's decided to tread the sides of highways, rather than veer a bit off course to use some of the paved trails along the way. When it comes to long hikes, he also finds roadside dirt and grass to be more forgiving on his feet than trail pavement.
To cover that mileage, a guy needs motivation. And training.
Compton got into hiking about 20 years ago, including five years living and working in England, where he hiked the upland Peaks District and the Lakes District. He's also climbed Maine's highest peak, Mount Katahdin, with one of his sons who has further inspired his hiking, Neal, who has scaled Mount Kenya in Africa and climbed to the base camp of Mount Everest.
When the Indiana hike is done, Compton will promptly head to Arizona to do a rim-to-rim hike of the Grand Canyon with sons Neal and Sam and some friends, delayed from last year by the pandemic. A prior year's hike and camping trip with full pack on the canyon's south rim taught him to pack lighter.
He has already been logging some 16- or 17-mile days along roadsides, after his wife drops him off at a given point. Ice and snow didn't bother him, but big trucks on U.S. 6 threw him some wind. Other times, he's hiked at Potato Creek State Park with a weighted vest to prepare for the Grand Canyon.
An infection with COVID-19 in November ""knocked me out,"" he says about a fever that lasted eight days. It vastly slowed down his training through December, causing him to worry what it would do to his walking mission. By January, he did what he doesn't generally like to do: He went inside of a gym to rebuild his strength. As long as it's at least 25 degrees, he prefers to train outside.
Now, he says, ""I'm definitely into the swing.""
And he's vaccinated.
Across Indiana, he'll follow a regimen of hiking from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on the road and a cycle of 6 days walking, then 3 days rest, adding, ""I'm a real scheduled kind of guy.""
He's driven the whole route, so he knows what to expect. He'll follow Indiana 933 through South Bend, then Indiana 931 (the old U.S. 31) to Plymouth and Rochester, Indiana 25 to Logansport, and then Indiana 29 until it turns into U.S. 421 (Michigan Road) and leads into Indianapolis. From there, he'll take U.S. 31 south to Louisville.
Down through Logansport, friends will drop him off and pick him up as he beds down at home. After that, friends and a cousin will ferry him and put him up for the night. But from Columbus to the end, he'll rely on hotels and an Uber ride or hotel shuttle. He'll appreciate the good rest because walking 15 miles makes his feet feel ""kind of mushy.""
Compton, a Plymouth city councilman who's served in other civic roles, will carry a piece of his father, who died in 1981, as he reaches out. He recalls one time, when he was 5 or 6, that his family was coming back from a trip to a Chicago museum. His dad saw a boy with crutches alongside the road. Two blocks later, his dad turned around to try to find the boy, driving up and down the street to no avail.
""He wanted to tell him about Riley,"" Compton says.
How to help: Compton says all donations will go to Riley Hospital for Children. Support can be mailed to the Robert ""Bob"" Compton Memorial Fundraiser, C/O Greg Compton, 713 N. Michigan St., Plymouth, IN 46563. Or go online to give.rileykids.org/gregcompton. He can be reached at 574-780-5725.
Motivation
Get WalkIN': Need motivation to get started on regular walks but don't have time to attend a class? This program from Purdue Extension, open to anyone age 18 and older in St. Joseph County, will send you email guidance and information to boost you along the way from April 5 to June 21. You'll need to complete two short online surveys. For questions, email Olivia at owestern@purdue.edu or sign up at http://bit.ly/getwalkinSJCspring2021.
Diana of the Dunes challenge: A new hiking challenge is starting in the Indiana Dunes National Park. ""Diana's Dare"" asks you to climb a dune at the park's West Beach near Gary. The park has renamed the dune after Alice Mabel Gray, who left her life in Chicago more than 100 years ago to live in an abandoned shanty in the dunes  a life that has inspired legends, ghost stories and books. The park will explain more about this trail challenge at 2 p.m. CDT Thursday at the national park's Facebook page. For more information, call the visitor's center at 219-395-1882.
Bike trail cleanup: Help to improve and clean up the mountain bike trail at Dr. T.K. Lawless County Park, 15122 Monkey Run St., Vandalia, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. with volunteers from the Northern Indiana Mountain Bike Association. Lunch and tools will be provided. This is the first of several spring work days to come on area trails.
Full moon hike: Indiana Dunes State Park in Chesterton will host a hike at 7:30 p.m. CDT Saturday from the nature center to Lake Michigan and back. You'll hear stories about the moon and stargazing, with treats provided. Registration is required at 219-926-1390.
Easter Basket Disc Golf: The disc golf baskets will be dressed up for Easter at 2 p.m. April 2 at Ferrettie-Baugo Creek County Park in Osceola. Kids can collect a piece of candy at each basket as they play. This is for ages 12 and younger, with an adult. Registration, at $4 per person, is due Monday at 574-654-3155.
Easter ""O"" Hunt: Look for Easter eggs as you orienteer your way through St. Patrick's County Park in South Bend using a map at 1 p.m. April 3. Eggs can be turned in for candy. Maps will be available for this easy, family-friendly course. Recommended for ages 6 and older; cost is $5 per child. Register by next Wednesday at 574-654-3155.
Falcon egg
Early this week, the peregrine falcons laid their first egg in the nest atop the County-City Building in downtown South Bend. We are watching to see if and when more eggs arrive. As I mentioned in last week's column, the mother seemed to be scrubbing the nest to prepare it for the big event. You can clearly see the egg via the live camera at falcam.southbendin.gov.
Local experts say that it appears these may be the same falcon parents, known as Maltese and Peace, who laid four eggs last year, three of which hatched. In 2019, the couple raised four falcons, three of which successfully left the nest. The fourth was injured and taken to Humane Indiana Wildlife.

778,"Publication: The Breeze, , James Madison University , Harrisonburg, VATYSONS, Va., Nov. 9, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Today, the PenFed Foundation, a national 501(c)(3) founded by PenFed Credit Union, announced the findings of its annual study on the top U.S. cities for veteran entrepreneurs. The PenFed Foundation Veteran Entrepreneur Investment Program , which supports veteran-owned startups and businesses through access to networks and capital, conducted the study in partnership with Edelman Intelligence.
According to the 2021 study, Washington, D.C., New York, and Seattle proved to be the top cities for veterans to start their businesses. The top emerging cities, or those that made the most progress since the PenFed Foundation's 2020 study, include Sioux Falls, Virginia Beach, and Kansas City. The study analyzed four main categories for each city, which include livability, economic growth, support for veterans, and ability to start a business. As the nation navigates the economic impacts of COVID-19, the study focused especially on city unemployment rates. The full study results can be found here.
""Military veterans are service-minded and often desire to continue to serve their communities in a meaningful way after transitioning to civilian life. At the PenFed Foundation, we are eager to help these veterans realize their entrepreneurial aspirations by connecting them with the education, preparation, and investment needed to support them,"" said PenFed Foundation President and retired Army General John W. Nicholson Jr. ""Part of this preparation includes creating ecosystems that veteran businesses can thrive in. We also know that veteran-owned businesses often hire more veterans, so supporting veteran entrepreneurs provides more jobs and opportunities for the greater military community.""
""The military community's resilience and strength is invaluable for our nation's business sector. That's why PenFed is proud to commission this study highlighting the cities that are making strides to support veteran businesses,"" said James Schenck, president and CEO of PenFed Credit Union and CEO of the PenFed Foundation. ""We want to help cities across the United States understand which environments are best suited for military veterans to start and grow businesses and inspire city leaders to take the actions needed to support veteran entrepreneurs.""
The top 20 cities for veteran entrepreneurs with (changes since the 2020 report) include:

Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metro Area (+1)
New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA Metro Area (-1)
Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA Metro Area (+1)
Chicago-Naperville-Elgin, IL-IN-WI Metro Area (-1)
Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, TX Metro Area (+2)
Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington, MN-WI Metro Area (-1)
Cleveland-Elyria, OH Metro Area (+3)
Kansas City, MO-KS Metro Area (+10)
Raleigh, NC Metro Area (+6)
Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH Metro Area (-4)
Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC Metro Area (+13)
Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land, TX Metro Area (-1)
Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell, GA Metro Area (+3)
Austin-Round Rock, TX Metro Area (-1)
Jacksonville, FL Metro Area (+4)
Columbus, OH Metro Area (+4)
Madison, WI Metro Area (-9)
Boise City, ID Metro Area (-1)
Milwaukee-Waukesha-West Allis, WI Metro Area (-5)
Sioux Falls, SD Metro Area (+23)

The top four emerging cities for veteran entrepreneurs are:

Sioux Falls, SD Metro Area +23
Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC Metro Area +13
Kansas City, MO-KS Metro Area +10
Raleigh, NC Metro Area +6

To paint the full picture of veteran support, city characteristics and entrepreneurship ability across the US, the study used a custom scoring algorithm based on a robust set of quantitative data from existing PenFed partners and openly available data sources.
""Each year, we look forward to releasing this study because we believe military veterans are uniquely equipped to be excellent business owners. Oftentimes, veteran entrepreneurs face challenges accessing resources such as business networks or capital. That's why we want to thank the top cities that are dedicated to helping veterans overcome these hurdles and teach others how to become more military and startup friendly,"" said Seda Goff, senior director of veteran entrepreneurship at PenFed Foundation.
Goff has a long-standing career working with military veterans and entrepreneurs. She served as city leader for Bunker Labs and teaches entrepreneurship at American University. Goff shared the findings of this study shortly after the launch of the Fall 2021 VEIP Master's Program, the PenFed Foundation's yearlong startup fundraising accelerator for veteran entrepreneurs.
VEIP has a three-pronged approach to create a robust network for veteran-owned startups and businesses:

Investment of seed capital, providing access to other capital investment programs and connecting entrepreneurs to funders;
Preparation through the Master's Program, a yearlong fundraising accelerator, and Ignition Challenges; and
Education through virtual and in-person workshops.

 Backyard barbecues, a full season of baseball, public pools and other classic scenes of Americana make a welcome return as normalcy slowly returns to the city. And of course, fireworks displays — arguably the signature of summer — are also expected to come back with a blast. Though the Centennial Olympic Park fireworks show, a perennial favorite, won’t spark off this year, there are still quite a few thrilling displays to commemorate the nation’s anniversary.
Here are six fireworks displays around the metro (and one just outside the metro) to mark the Fourth of July weekend.
July 4th Fireworks in Alpharetta 
The city of Alpharetta invites spectators out for a star-spangled night of celebration with its fireworks display in Wills Park. With COVID-19 precautions in mind, the city will not feature additional festivities as it did in years past.
Yet, with a city-issued encouragement to wear masks and social distance, families should still find delight in the annual pyrotechnic presentation.
“We are excited to be in a place where we can host Alpharetta’s annual fireworks display in Wills Park again this year,” says Morgan Rodgers, director of recreation, parks and cultural services for the city of Alpharetta. “The Fourth of July holiday is a wonderful time for the community to come together in celebration.”
7-9 p.m. Sunday. Free. Wills Park, 11925 Wills Road, Alpharetta. 678-297- 6000, alpharetta.ga.us 
Decatur July 4th Fireworks
The city of Decatur welcomes visitors and residents out to enjoy their fireworks display, which will be launched from the top of the DeKalb County parking deck and largely viewable from the downtown areas. The city will not host its annual Pied Piper Parade nor the Concert on the Square due to COVID-19 concerns. However, all are still invited to safely view the 15- to 20-minute fireworks show. Social distancing and masks are encouraged.
9 p.m. Sunday.
Free. Downtown Decatur. 678-615-0915, visitdecaturgeorgia.com
City of Marietta’s 4th in the Park Celebration
Though officially on Saturday, July 3, Marietta’s 4th in the Park Celebration promises a full day of fun. Festivities begin early in Marietta Square, starting with a 10 a.m. parade.
The parade is expected to feature more than 30 floats and roughly 2,000 participants. The day of events also includes a kids’ zone with crafts, street food vendors to complement the square’s popular restaurants, live entertainment, and, of course, fireworks.
“The festival, which also kicks off at 10 a.m., is packed full of music, food, artisans and games for adults and children of all ages,” says city of Marietta’s Community Engagement Supervisor Maggi Moss. “The day ends with a spectacular fireworks display at 9:30 p.m., where you will be surrounded by oohs and aahs from everyone in the crowd.”
10 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturday.
Free. Marietta Square, 50 Park Square, Marietta. 770- 794-5601, mariettaga.gov
Independence Day Weekend with the Atlanta Braves
Since it’s widely known as “America’s favorite pastime,” a baseball game would be viewed by many as the quintessential outing to celebrate the nation’s independence.
Fortunately, fans will have plenty of opportunities to hit the ballpark over the weekend as the Braves have a homestand that started this week against the New York Mets.
The Braves organization will hold a fireworks presentation following tonight’s home game against the Miami Marlins.
Then on Saturday, the Braves will host another game and celebrate the grand opening of the Warrior Alliance Home Base at The Battery, which will provide services to veterans.
Lastly, the weekend will conclude Sunday with the July 4 baseball game against the Marlins. This game will not feature fireworks, but the Independence Day game programming will include special video highlights, T-38 jet flyovers and other celebrations.
Game times vary.
Through Sunday. Free to access The Battery Atlanta Plaza; tickets for Braves game start at $12. Truist Park, 755 Battery Ave. SE, Atlanta. 404-577-9100, mlb.com/braves.
Sandy Springs Stars & Stripes Fireworks Celebration
Previously held at the Concourse Corporate Center, this year’s celebration will kick off for the first time at the City Springs complex.
In addition to the restaurants in and near the complex, visitors also can partake in food truck options starting at 6 p.m. and live music from The Rupert’s Orchestra starting at 7:30 p.m. Fireworks begin at 9:30 p.m. Sunday. Free. 1 Galambos Way, Sandy Springs. 770-730-5600, sandyspringsga.gov.
The Fantastic Fourth Celebration at Stone Mountain Park
Touting praise such as “America’s Most Spectacular Fourth of July Fireworks,” from Reader’s Digest, and “Must-See Fireworks Show,” by USA Today, the Stone Mountain Park fireworks show returns for its 53rd year with a bang (or really a few).
“The Fantastic 4th Celebration has been a family summer tradition for many years,” says Michael Dombrowski, vice president and general manager at Stone Mountain Park, about the fireworks show that started in 1967. The 2020 show was canceled due to COVID-19 concerns. “We are so excited to provide families a day full of fun on our attractions, the Lasershow Spectacular and, of course, five days of the exact same fireworks show, July 1-5.”
Each night of the fiveday festival will feature its signature laser light show on the mountain, followed immediately after by the fireworks display.
Ticketed reservations are required, as admissions into the show and park are limited due to the pandemic.
Laser show begins at 9:30 p.m., with the extended fireworks show immediately following.
July 1-5. Prices starting at $10 (to reserve a square for up to four persons), reservations required.

The Fourth at The Ritz-Carlton Reynolds, Lake Oconee
For a different starry night scene, consider a holiday weekend outside the metro at the Ritz-Carlton Reynolds in Lake Oconee. Overnight guests of the property will be treated to the Ritz’s fireworks display and live entertainment on Saturday night. (Note: a three-night minimum stay is required during the popular weekend).
“There is nothing else like a Fourth of July holiday on the lake as friends and family reconnect and make new memories together — from splashing along the sandy shores of Lake Oconee to enjoying the traditions that have returned to our backyard, including live music and fireworks,” says Ralph Vick, general manager of The Ritz-Carlton Reynolds, Lake Oconee.
Additionally, returning guests of the Ritz may be in for another type of sparkling surprise, as the property recently renovated many of the facilities, including the fireside rooms, family pool, private lakeside cottages and three-floor private Lake House.

780,"Media Relations, Public Health Agency of Canada, 613-957-2983, media@hc-sc.gc.caThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to create stress and anxiety for many Canadians, particularly those who do not have ready access to their regular support networks. Through the Wellness Together Canada online portal, people of all ages across the country can access immediate, free and confidential mental health and substance use supports, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. PocketWell, a free companion app to the WTC online portal, provides another way to help Canadians access online mental health and substance use resources, and measure and track aspects of their mental well-being. OTTAWA, ON, March 4, 2022 /CNW/ - The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) continues to monitor COVID-19 epidemiological indicators to quickly detect, understand and communicate emerging issues of concern. The following is a brief summary with the latest national numbers and trends.
With a shift to more targeted testing, a range of other indicators, from laboratory test positivity to daily numbers of people in hospitals and critical care continue to be important for monitoring trends. While the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still circulating widely, the epidemiological situation is variable across Canada. Some jurisdictions continue to report increased case counts, which is likely contributing to an observed overall slower decline in disease activity nationally over the latest 7-day period. Given ongoing easing of public health measures, it is not unexpected that we could see further increased transmission in additional areas over the weeks ahead. Although uncertainties remain in how the trajectory, and the virus itself, might evolve in the weeks and months ahead, there is no doubt that our best bet is to maintain caution and care as we get back to more in-person activities, indoor settings, and larger gatherings.
During the latest 7 day period (Feb 25-Mar 3, 2022), an average of 5,663 new cases were reported daily across Canada, a 5% decrease compared to the week prior. Laboratory test positivity during the latest 7 day period (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2022) remained at 11%, indicating still widespread activity across the country.
Severe illness trends continue to decline, with weekly reductions reported in most jurisdictions. The latest provincial and territorial data show that an average of 5,153 people with COVID-19 were being treated in hospitals each day during the most recent 7-day period (Feb 25-Mar 3, 2022), which is 15% lower than last week. This includes, on average, 618 people who were being treated in intensive care units (ICU) daily, which is a 16% decrease compared to the prior week, and an average of 58 deaths were reported daily (Feb 25-Mar 3, 2022). Keeping infection rates down remains key to further reducing severe illness trends and protecting vulnerable populations over the coming weeks.
Immunization for all those who are eligible, but are yet to receive their primary series, remains a top priority. As of February 24, 2022, provinces and territories have administered over 81 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines. The latest provincial and territorial data indicate that over 80% of the total population are now fully vaccinated. Age-specific vaccine coverage data, as of February 27, 2022, show that over 88% of people 12 years or older have at least one dose and over 84% are fully vaccinated, while among children aged 5-11 years of age, 57% have at least one dose.
Health authorities continue to strongly recommend up-to-date COVID-19 vaccination for all eligible people, including for those who have had or may have had a COVID-19 infection. All told, over 5.4 million eligible Canadians need one or more doses to complete their primary series and many others are eligible to get a booster dose to help improve protection that may have decreased since their second dose and to provide even better protection against severe illness from Omicron. In particular, getting a booster dose if you are eligible, and especially for those aged 50 years of age or older, is very important. Recent studies indicate that an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine booster dose enhances the overall immune response, which can provide longer lasting protection and possibly better effectiveness against variants. As of March 3, over 17 million third doses have been administered to date. National data as of February 27, 2022 indicate that over 82% of seniors aged 70 years or older and 60%-74% of 50-69 year olds have received an additional dose.
As we move into a lower transmission phase and beyond, our best advantage going forward will be to maintain vigilance and not forget the personal protective habits we have learned. At the individual level, this can be best achieved by keeping COVID-19 vaccinations up-to-date, including getting a booster dose when eligible and continuing to follow public health advice tailored to local epidemiology and circumstances to guide your individual and family risk assessment and decisions on use of personal protective practices. In particular, properly wearing a well-fitted and well-constructed face mask, avoiding crowding, and getting the best ventilation possible in indoor spaces, are layers of protection that can reduce your risk in all settings.
We can also stay healthier by getting up-to-date with other recommended vaccines and routine vaccines for children and adults. For additional information regarding vaccination in your area, reach out to your local public health authorities, healthcare provider, or other trusted and credible sources, such as Immunize.ca and Canada.ca, which includes information to help Canadians understand the benefits of being vaccinated against COVID-19.
Canadians can also go the extra mile by sharing credible information on COVID-19 risks and prevention practices and measures to reduce COVID-19 in communities. Read my backgrounder to access more COVID-19 Information and Resources on ways to reduce the risks and protect yourself and others, including information on COVID-19 vaccination.

781,"BRICK - Karina Munoz waited three years to get another crack at a state title.
After a solid showing as a freshman at the gymnastics state individual championships, Munoz missed the finals as a sophomore due to injury. As a junior, Munoz didn't get a chance to participate after the competition was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
On Nov. 13, Munoz made the most of her swan song.
Setting a new meet record with 9.85 in floor, East Brunswick's Munoz placed first in three events and ran away with the all-around title with a score of 38.225 — edging Old Bridge's Amanda Scheuerman (38.125).
""To finish on top is amazing, this was truly special,"" Munoz said. ""I've been waiting for this moment. I've been in the gym working hard. To do what I was able to do feels amazing.""
Her 9.85 in floor was an absolute stunner. In bars, Munoz edged Central's Gianna Mastellone by 0.025 points with a 9.700. Her vault score of 9.825 was just good enough to place in front of Scheuerman's 9.800.

783,"Feb. 11ORFORDVILLE  The move is simply known as ""The Assassin.""
It is used as a pinning combination by many wrestlers.
Korben Brown has perfected the move.
The Orfordville Parkview senior standout has flattened many opponents using ""The Assassin"" in a storied four-year varsity career at Parkview.
He hopes to apply it three more times Saturday at the WIAA Division 3 state meet at Wausau East High School.
Brown, who was third at state last year, is currently ranked second at 152 pounds and needs three wins Saturday to capture the program's first-ever state title.
""Ever since I got third last year, my main goal was to win state this year,"" Brown said. ""I feel like I've worked just as hard as anybody else, if not harder.
""And I like the fact that it's a one-day tournament and not a three-day one like before. When it's stretched out, you tend to think about things too much when you're not wrestling. I just like wrestling and getting it over with.""
Brown is 12-1 on the season, with the only loss coming when he was forced to injury default due to an illness in a match he was leading 18-6 at the time.
Defending state champion and top-ranked Kole Marko of St. Croix Falls, who won at 145 last year, figures to be Brown's toughest test Saturday. They would not meet until the finals.
Brown is not the only Vikings wrestler that will be making a state appearance. Sophomore Wyatt Egan qualified at 170 and senior Luke Schwengels at 182.
Parkview coach Joel Steinmann said in a COVID-driven season, his three state qualifiers have been all business.
""I told them after the first day of practice, and after having to wear masks, to get your complaining out of the way because moving forward, I wasn't going to listen to it,"" Steinmann said. ""Not one of them ever complained or did anything but work hard each and every day.
""And the fact that all three of them are around the same weight class, they can get after it with each other every day in practice. All three are very deserving of getting to state.""
Parkview is one of three area teams with three state qualifiers. Evansville and Delavan-Darien got three wrestlers through to state in Division 2.
Delavan-Darien is led by senior Mason Hennessey at 106 and junior Cole Hanson at 170, who were both sectional champs. Junior Owen Chelminiak also qualified at 160.
Evansville is led by sectional champions sophomore Owen Heiser at 160 and senior Collin Roberts at 195. Senior Waylon Klitzman also advanced at 285.
The area's best bet for a state champion may come in Division 1. Elkhorn Area junior Joey Showalter is unbeaten at 113 pounds and has spent the entire season ranked No. 1.
Milton has two state qualifiers in junior Riley Nilo at 106 and freshman Aeoden Sinclair at 152.
Saturday's Division 1 state meet is at Kaukauna, with Division 2 at Adam's-Friendship.

785,"This year's Grammy Awards will spotlight a new location – Las Vegas – and an inching toward normalcy as it again unfolds in front of a live audience after a 2021 hybrid edition.
Tonight's 64th annual show, postponed from January amid a spike in omicron COVID-19 cases, marks the first time the ceremony has taken place anywhere other than Los Angeles or New York since a 1973 Nashville edition.
Along with the usual starry lineup of performers – BTS, newly minted Oscar winner Billie Eilish and Carrie Underwood among them – the 2022 Grammys might also witness history made by several performers.
Taylor Swift could become the first artist to win album of the year four times (with ""Evermore""), and BTS could become the first K-pop group to win a Grammy.
And Eilish would be the first person to take home record of the year three times in succession – and the first woman  to do so – if ""Happier Than Ever"" wins the category.
But we know you have questions.
So from the top nominees to the performance lineup, here's everything you need to know going into the Grammys:
What time are the Grammy Awards? Sunday's show airs live on CBS and Paramount+ at 7 p.m. The Grammys' 2022 home, MGM Grand Garden Arena, is the substitute location because of difficulties rescheduling at LA's Crypto.com Arena (formerly the Staples Center), the show's usual home. The Vegas venue has also hosted the Latin Grammys every year since 2009.
How can I watch or livestream the Grammys? Along with airing on CBS, the show can be streamed live and on demand on Paramount+ and is accessible via CBS.com and the CBS app (with a cable subscription). Fans can tune into the premiere ceremony – when about 70 of the 86 awards are distributed – starting at 2:30  at grammy.com and the Recording Academy's YouTube channel. Jimmie Allen, Ledisi, Mon Laferte and Allison Russell are confirmed to perform, and LeVar Burton is hosting.
How can I watch the red carpet? Arrivals will be streamed on grammy.com (starting at 5:30) and E! starts its red carpet coverage at 3, with ""Live From the Red Carpet"" starting at 5.
Who's performing live at the Grammys? Jon Batiste, Eilish, Underwood, J Balvin, Silk Sonic, John Legend, BTS, Brandi Carlile, H.E.R., Lil Nas X, Olivia Rodrigo, Chris Stapleton, Nas, Jack Harlow, Brothers Osborne, Leslie Odom Jr. and Cynthia Erivo are among the names set to take the stage. The Foo Fighters had been announced as performers before the unexpected death of drummer Taylor Hawkins; the band will not appear. Producers told Variety they're working on a way to honor Hawkins during the ceremony.
Who are the biggest Grammy nominees? Batiste is the leader this year with 11 nominations  among multiple genres. The jazz/R&B veteran, best known as the bandleader on ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,"" is followed by Justin Bieber, H.E.R. and Doja Cat, all of whom scored eight nods. Eilish ties pop newcomer Rodrigo with seven nominations each. The Grammy-gobbling Eilish  landed in top categories including album, song and record of the year for her sophomore effort ""Happier Than Ever"" and its title anthem. Rodrigo has a notable showing in all four major categories: album (""Sour""), song and record of the year (""Drivers License"") and best new artist. Two new categories are being introduced this year: best global music performance and best música urbana album.
Which musicians got snubbed? Miley Cyrus' valentine to the '80s, ""Plastic Hearts,"" boasted cameos from Steve Nicks, Joan Jett, Billy Idol and current pop whiz Dua Lipa. But despite a best pop vocal album Grammy nomination in 2015 for ""Bangerz"" (she lost to Sam Smith's ""In the Lonely Hour""), her seventh studio album received zero recognition. Machine Gun Kelly also missed out on Grammy love for his fifth studio album, ""Tickets to My Downfall,"" which established him as a pop-punkster and spawned the rock hits ""Bloody Valentine"" and ""My Ex's Best Friend."" BTS, meanwhile, can make history as the first K-pop group to win a Grammy, but they only have one chance: ""Butter"" earned a lone nod for best pop duo/group performance.
Who's hosting the Grammys? Trevor Noah returns for an encore stint, though he'll have a more traditional show to steer compared with last year's 2021 hybrid event at the Los Angeles Convention Center. The Emmy Award-winning host of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show"" proved himself a breezy emcee last year, bopping between the nominees outside and the performers inside. Even though the scene is different, Noah will still have a standard awards show setup as his playground.",Everything you need to know about the Grammys
786,"The federal partnership is part of a broader effort to reduce gaps in vaccination rates among Maine counties and provide more vaccination sites in smaller communities.
State and federal health officials plan to hold the first of about a dozen mobile COVID-19 vaccination clinics next week as part of a larger push into harder-to-reach communities across Maine.
The Mills administration announced Tuesday the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s “mobile vaccination unit” will be at Oxford Casino beginning Monday and is slated to hold similar, multiday clinics in 10 additional communities over the next two months.
The appointment-only clinics are expected to administer up to 250 shots a day of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine, targeting rural, medically underserved communities stretching from the western Maine mountains to Calais and Madawaska.
The new partnership between the state and FEMA comes at a time when ever-larger shipments of vaccine doses mean that, beginning Wednesday, all Maine residents 16 or older will be eligible for vaccination. Yet new coronavirus infections and hospitalizations are trending upward in Maine, with 290 new COVID-19 cases but no deaths reported Tuesday, and younger Mainers are contracting the disease at higher rates.
“There are concerning signs on the horizon there,” Dr. Nirav Shah, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control & Prevention, said during a briefing Tuesday. “At the same time, vaccination rates are going up. The question is can we outrun this increase? And we’re on a good clip. We are one of the better-performing states. If any state has a good shot of outrunning this increase in case rates, it is going to be Maine.”
Maine is the second state in New England — the sixth nationwide — slated to utilize FEMA’s mobile vaccination units. Jeanne Lambrew, commissioner of the Maine Department of Health and Human Services, said the agency will work with local officials and community organizations to reach out to high-risk or vulnerable residents to help make appointments.
Residents of Oxford County can check on availability for next Monday’s clinic by calling Maine’s Community Vaccination Line at 1-888-445-4111. Additional details on future clinics and scheduling will be posted on the state’s vaccination website, maine.gov/covid19/vaccines,  in the coming days.
“This is a prototype that was developed by the Biden Administration … to figure out how it can support both rural states and large states,” Lambrew said. “We have seen their community vaccination clinics in big stadiums in urban areas. This is one of their first ones that will be in rural, underserved communities.”
Additionally, the White House announced Tuesday that Maine will receive $18.4 million to further expand access to COVID-19 vaccines and to address other “health equity” issues in rural or medically underserved communities. Part of that funding, which stems from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan recently passed by Congress, will finance a new Office of Population Health Equity within the Maine CDC.
Lambrew said the new office came out of conversations with community groups last year as Maine struggled to address disproportionately high COVID-19 rates in some population groups. At the beginning of last summer, for instance, Maine had the nation’s largest racial disparity, with Black residents contracting COVID-19 at rates more than 20 times higher than white residents.
“COVID-19 has highlighted the disparities in our Maine health care system in ways that have been really challenging for residents as well as the state and the providers who serve people,” Lambrew said.
 
RISING CASES AND INOCULATIONS
Tuesday marked the eighth consecutive day in which new case numbers topped 200 in Maine as many states across the country are once again seeing infection rates rising. The 290 new cases was just below the seven-day average of 292 cases daily, compared to an average of 214 cases for the week ending March 30 and a recent low of 140 in late February.
To date, there have been 52,275 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 in Maine since the coronavirus was first detected here in March 2020. At least 746 deaths have been linked to the disease, according to figures from the Maine CDC.
Shah noted that Maine’s positivity rate for testing is now up to 3%, compared to less than 2% several weeks ago. Positive test results have been flowing in at such a fast rate that Maine CDC epidemiologists have struggled to keep pace with their reviews to determine whether each positive test represents a new case or a repeat test of a previously identified case.
But Maine also has among the nation’s highest vaccination rates at a time when eligibility will expand again Wednesday from adults 50 or older to anyone 16 or older.
As of Tuesday morning, 34.5% of Maine’s 1.3 million residents — or 463,662 individuals — had received at least one dose of vaccine, and 23.6%, or 316,929 people, had received all of the shots necessary to become fully inoculated. Those figures increase to 41.2% and 28.2%, respectively, if only Maine residents 16 or older are included.
Maine ranked fourth among the states — behind New Hampshire, New Mexico and Connecticut — in terms of the percentage of the population that had received at least one dose and fifth-highest for the percentage who have completed their vaccination regimens, according to tracking by Bloomberg News.
Maine’s allotment of vaccine doses from the federal government is expected to exceed 91,000 this week, boosted in part by a 46% increase in shipments to retail pharmacies such as Walgreens, Walmart, Hannaford and Shaw’s supermarkets. The federal government also plans to ship doses to CVS pharmacies in Maine, as well as to Good Neighbor and MedShoppe, which operate in Aroostook and Androscoggin counties.
 
‘URGENCY, NOT HESITANCY’
Vaccination rates vary widely across the state, which is an issue that DHHS officials hope to address through the FEMA mobile units and other initiatives in the coming weeks.
For instance, about 38% of Cumberland County residents have received at least one dose of vaccine, but only 25% of Somerset County residents have received their first shot.
And the disparity is even wider within certain age groups. About 85% of those 70 or older in Cumberland, Sagadahoc and Lincoln counties have received all of the shots required to be fully vaccinated, compared with just 65% in Androscoggin County and 60% in Piscataquis County.
The Maine CDC routinely redirects vaccine doses to different areas of the state in response to both need and demand. Shah noted that vaccine “hesitancy” is a nationwide challenge, including in Maine, but suggested that demand for vaccination appointments was robust headed into Wednesday’s expanded eligibility.
“What we are really seeing overwhelmingly across the state remains urgency, not hesitancy, particularly as we move into different and more age groups,” Shah said.
COVID-19 cases rates are rising in many states across the country, due in part to the growing prevalence of more transmissible variants. In Michigan, for instance, an estimated 70% of all new cases involve the B.1.1.7 variant first identified in the United Kingdom, and the variant accounts for about 60% of new cases in Florida, The New York Times reported.
To date, the Maine CDC has identified 15 cases of the U.K. variant in this state along with one case of the P.1 variant first identified in Brazil and four cases of B.1.351 variant first identified in South Africa. Those figures have not changed since March 26 based on Maine CDC’s routine analysis of roughly 5% of positive case results.
Hospitalization numbers also are ticking upward in Maine, after having remained relatively flat for weeks.
As of Tuesday, there were 80 people hospitalized statewide with COVID-19, with 32 of them being treated in critical care units and eight connected to ventilators.

",MS/KJ: Maine to launch mobile units with FEMA to boost rural access to COVID-19 vaccine
787,"If these Tigers draft picks reach their potential.
If they stay healthy.
If nothing goes horribly wrong.
The Tigers crushed this draft.
Granted, I've preceded that statement with several if's and a layer of uncertainty. But the MLB draft is all about potential; and if you view the Tigers' draft through the potential lens, I love this draft class because the Tigers took so many players with such high ceilings.
So here are 10 thoughts and predictions about this draft class:
1. Ace of the future
First bold prediction: Jackson Jobe, the Tigers first-round pick, will become the ace of the staff if he stays healthy and reaches his potential. Yes, I realize the Tigers have a ton of outstanding, young arms right now, including Casey Mize and Tarik Skubal. Don't forget Spencer Turnbull, Joey Wentz, Matt Manning and Alex Faedo. But from everything I'm learning, Jobe could be All-Star good. He could be Cy Young Award good. I know he is only 18 and things can go wrong with high school arms. But his potential is crazy.
2. Not a quick fix
It's clear the Tigers believe that Jobe's potential is higher than the high school shortstops who were available.
Only time will tell if they were right. But this draft is a reminder the Tigers won't solve all of their problems through the draft. They still have a glaring organizational need for a shortstop. That means owner Chris Ilitch has to open up his checkbook, follow the lead of his late father and start throwing cash around. This organization won't advance from mode to contender until Ilitch starts to sign some high-end free agents to plug the holes.
3. Boom! What a pick!
Second bold prediction: Ty Madden will be the steal of the draft for the Tigers. Some considered Madden a top-10 talent. But he slipped and the Tigers took him in compensation round at No. 32.
""We really liked him,"" Scott Pleis, the Tigers scouting director, said. ""I was surprised he slid as far as he did. But there's always somebody that does that.
When we got (catcher Dillon) Dingler, we didn't think he was gonna get to us either. So he's kind of our Dingler this year, where we didn't think he was going to be there. And he was, so it was a nice surprise.""
4. Diamond in the rough
Wait a second. Did he just say Madden is the Dingler of this draft? That's a huge statement. Dingler has turned into a foundation piece in this rebuild — somebody who looks like he will be the long-term answer at catcher. He has already climbed to Double-A Erie. And if Madden can climb to Erie next summer, this year's ""Dingler"" is a heck of a player.
5. Armed and ready
The Tigers didn't take a single pitcher in the five-round 2020 draft.
So they drafted 12 pitchers this year — the most since they took 12 in the first 20 rounds in 2015. This year, the Tigers drafted righties — OK, a ton of righties — and they got lefties. They got short pitchers and they got a massive pitcher.
Most will start out slated as starters.
""With the risk of injury and things happen, you can never have enough pitching,"" Pleis said. ""We really restocked there, so we should be fine for a while.""
6. Size does matter
The Tigers went big in this draft. I'm talking massive. They took Charleston Southern's R.J. Petit, a 6-foot-8 and 300 pound right-handed pitcher in the 14th round.
""Big, physical guy,"" Pleis said. ""We have some history on him. One of our area guys knows him from Charleston so we had we had little inside track on him, so we've known about him for a while and we've liked what we saw, so it was nice to get him.""
7. OK, size doesn't matter
The Tigers also went small, drafting Aaron Haase, a 5-foot-8 pitcher from Wichita State.
""Aaron can pitch,"" Pleis said. ""We like the make up. We've got a little insight there too as you probably know.""
There appears to be no relation to catcher Eric Haase.
But David Chadd, the Tigers assistant GM, is a longtime Wichitan.
8. These unprecedented times
This was a surprising draft, right from the start, when Louisville catcher Henry Davis was taken first overall by the Pirates.
And the surprises kept coming.
""It was a very strange draft, really,"" Pleis said.
In most years, the Tigers' draft board is pretty close to how players are picked, according to Pleis.
""This one kind of jumped all over the place,"" Pleis said
Maybe, it's because COVID-19 made it so difficult to scout these players and make a draft board.
And maybe, the Tigers found some gems in later rounds because of it.
9. When do I start?
With this draft being held later in the summer, it's going to affect where these players start.
""Everything's a little different,"" Pleis said. ""These high school kids finished two months ago.""
Assuming the Tigers sign Jobe, it will be interesting to see if he's shut down until instructional ball in the fall.
10. The future is bright
I'm not the only one who thinks the Tigers nailed this draft.
Jon Heyman, an insider at MLB Network, sent out a Tweet on Tuesday morning, stating that the Tigers had the second-best draft class after the first 10 picks.
Add in Riley Greene and Spencer Torkelson playing in the Futures Game on Sunday, and it was an encouraging few days for the Tigers.

WASHINGTON - President Joe Biden has selected two former senior National Security Agency officials for key cyber roles in his administration, the White House said Monday in moving to fill out a team whose role has grown more urgent after two major hacks that have consumed the government's attention.
Chris Inglis, a former NSA deputy director, is being nominated as the government's first national cyber director. Jen Easterly, a former deputy for counterterrorism at the NSA, has been tapped to run the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security. The two officials are expected to work closely with Anne Neuberger, the administration's deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology. 
The cyber director position, a job mandated by law and championed by some lawmakers and outside experts, is designed to help ensure a more streamlined strategy and coordinated response to cyberattacks that invariably pull in officials from multiple agencies. In filling it with a veteran intelligence and national security expert, Biden is likely signaling that he recognizes the importance of cybersecurity as his administration continues to grapple with two major cyber incidents.
The administration is expected to soon announce a response to the SolarWinds hack, a breach of federal government agencies and American corporations believed to have been carried out by Russian hackers, and has also been occupied by an intrusion affecting Microsoft Exchange email software. The company has said that hack was carried out by Chinese state hackers.
Michigan lockdown urged: The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that Michigan should ""close things down"" to help address the country's worst coronavirus outbreak, days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer instead urged people to voluntarily restrict certain activities.
Dr. Rochelle Walensky made the statement after being asked about some public health experts' calls to send additional doses of COVID-19 vaccine to the state, for which the governor has been advocating. The administration of President Joe Biden has stuck with allocating to states proportionally by population.
""So when you have an acute situation, extraordinary number of cases like we have in Michigan, the answer is not necessarily to give vaccine,"" Walensky said, explaining that it takes two to six weeks to see the effect of vaccinations. ""The answer to that is to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to back to where we were last spring, last summer and to shut things down, to flatten the curve, to decrease contact with one another, to test ... to contact trace.""
Syria chlorine attack probe: An investigation by the global chemical weapons watchdog found ""reasonable grounds to believe"" that a Syrian air force military helicopter dropped a chlorine cylinder on a Syrian town in 2018, sickening 12 people, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons said Monday.
It is the second time that the OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team has concluded that Syrian government armed forces likely were responsible for a gas attack. Last year, the team also found reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Force was responsible for attacks using chlorine and the nerve agent sarin in March 2017 in the town of Latamneh.
Syria has repeatedly been accused of using chemical weapons during the country's grinding civil war. The government of President Bashar Assad denies the claims.
Scandal snares ex-PM: The controversy over former British Prime Minister David Cameron's lobbying on behalf of a now-bankrupt financial services firm deepened Monday as the government launched an investigation that opponents immediately labeled a ""cover-up.""
The Conservative government announced plans for an independent inquiry into Greensill Capital after Cameron made his first comments on the scandal and two senior politicians called for new rules on contacts between business representatives and government officials.
Over the past month, a series of news reports revealed that Cameron lobbied government officials on behalf of Greensill, which collapsed last month, threatening thousands of jobs at a British steelmaker that it helped finance.
Cameron, who was employed as a part-time adviser to Greensill, said his work on behalf of the company didn't break any rules or codes of conduct on the activities of former ministers.
""There are important lessons to be learnt,"" Cameron said. ""As a former prime minister, I accept that communications with government need to be done through only the most formal of channels, so there can be no room for misinterpretation.""
Ecuador, Peru elections: Ecuador will be led for the next four years by a conservative businessman after voters on Sunday rebuffed a left-leaning movement that yielded an economic boom and then a recession since taking hold of the presidency last decade. That election certainty, however, did not extend to neighboring Peru, where the presidential contest is headed to a runoff after none of the 18 candidates obtained more than 50% of the votes. 
The South American nations held elections under strict public health measures amid a surging coronavirus pandemic that has brought on new lockdowns and exacerbated a general sense of fatigue. Peru, which also elected a new Congress, reported its highest single-day COVID-19 death count just as voters headed to the polls.
The victory of former banker Guillermo Lasso in Ecuador came after less than half of one percentage point put him ahead of another candidate and allowed him to claim a spot in Sunday's runoff.
Princes remember Philip: William and Harry paid tribute Monday to their grandfather, Prince Philip, remembering his wit, sense of duty and barbecue skills.
The brothers issued separate statements amid a family rift that led to Harry's decision to step away from royal duties last year, and some have speculated that their grandfather's funeral may offer an opportunity for them to talk over their differences. Philip, who had been married to Queen Elizabeth II for more than seven decades, died last week at 99. 
Harry, who stepped away from royal duties last year and now lives in California, has arrived in the U.K. to attend Philip's funeral service. His wife, Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, is pregnant and was advised by her doctor not to make the long journey.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 14, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Amtrak successfully advanced its COVID-19 recovery efforts throughout its 50th Anniversary fiscal year, through continued safety measures for customers and employees, increased train service levels in line with growing demand and continued building a strong foundation for modernization and growth. With announcements of our largest order for new trains in decades, the opening of new stations, the addition of new customer services and amenities, and our proposals for new corridor service in up to 160 communities, Amtrak put in motion key initiatives to support an enhanced national rail network capable of serving more people in more places with better service.
""Our customers trust Amtrak's commitment to safety and are responding positively to the investments and improvements we are making,"" said Amtrak CEO Bill Flynn. ""We will continue to prioritize offering a modern, safe and reliable customer experience and preparing for what should be a monumental fiscal year 2022."" 
Business is now at about 70% of pre-COVID levels, up from 25% at this time in FY20, and based on the current forecast, ridership and revenue is expected to improve to about 80% of pre-COVID levels by the end of fiscal year 2022.
""Our 50th year as a company is certainly a milestone, and we launched several hallmark initiatives as we embark on a new era for passenger rail,"" said Amtrak Board Chair Tony Coscia. ""The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law enacted by the Biden Administration and Congress is a historic investment that will benefit customers and communities and prove that Amtrak is an important part of a larger solution to help America tackle the climate crisis, create economic opportunity and expand mobility."" 
Preliminary results for fiscal year 2021 (Oct. 2020 - Sept. 2021) include:Safety: Since the COVID-19 vaccine offers the best way to keep its employees and customers safe, Amtrak required employees to become vaccinated, resulting in 97% of our employees with at least one vaccination dose, excluding employees who are on leave of absence or have an approved accommodation. Total Capital Spend: Advanced $2.2 billion in capital spending, including major milestones such as the Hudson Tunnel Project property acquisition and new multi-powered trainsets.  Ridership: Provided 12.2 million customer trips, with more than half of those trips taking place in the second half of the year, and growth of 4 million over the 2020 rate and a 42% increase over our FY21 goal. Adjusted Operating Earnings1: ($1.08 billion) and $400 million ahead of plan due to strong ridership gains driven by new approaches to marketing and pricing that helped attract new riders.Amtrak highlights in fiscal year 2021 can be found here.

802,"Aug. 8 - AMMAN  -  The Health Ministry will reprioritise the Kingdom's COVID-19 vaccination process, according to an official.
In an interview with Al Mamlaka TV on Sunday, the Secretary General of the Health Ministry for epidemiological affairs and the official in charge of the COVID-19 crisis, Adel Bilbeisi, said that 545,000 individuals have missed their COVID-19 vaccine appointments.
""Around 212,000 individuals missed their second dose of the COVID-19 vaccine and 333,000 individuals missed their first dose,"" Bilbeisi said.
The total number of people who received the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine reached 3,171,813 and 2,417,262 received their second shot, as of Sunday, according to the government.
The number of people who have registered on the vaccination platform has reached 3,714,521, according to the government as of Sunday.
On Sunday, the ministry called on individuals who took the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine before July 10 to take the second dose without an appointment, ""to reduce the duration between the two doses"".
Bilbeisi also pointed out that after the government offered vaccines without an appointment, only 333,000 people missed their vaccine, versus 450,000 people who missed their vaccines before the government decision.
Omar Mahmoud, 19, told The Jordan Times on Sunday that he did not postpone his vaccination appointments because he did not want ""the whole process to take forever, so as soon as I got an appointment I went to the vaccination centre"".
Noor Shabaough, 25, said that ""lots of people I know did not make it to their second COVID-19 dose, either because they were too lazy to go or because they did not intend to take the second dose"".
""There should be a certain gap between the two doses. And people should not be reckless especially when it comes to a serious thing like the vaccination,"" Shabaough said

In March 2020, West Chester University transitioned to online learning due to the coronavirus pandemic. Almost a year later, students are still adapting to the world of virtual learning, and many are eager to get back on campus as soon as possible. Here are five ways to continue to stay motivated during remote learning:
1.Know that you are not alone.
Students all across the world are dealing with the harsh reality of online learning. Virtual learning has presented challenges for many students who are anxious to get back on campus and continue face-to-face instruction. When taking these classes, know that you are not alone and that you have professors, advisors and faculty members from West Chester University who are willing to help and make your virtual experience as easy as possible. Take advantage of faculty’s office hours and email them whenever you are having trouble, and they will do the best they can to assist you in all your needs.
2. Take advantage of lenient grading.
West Chester University is offering a COVID-19 grading policy in which you can decide whether you want your classes to affect your GPA. The administration realizes that virtual learning causes many problems for students who prefer face-to-face interaction, and as a result of this, they are allowing you to be flexible in what goes on your student record. This is beneficial to students as they have more control over what employers can see on their record, and their grades should benefit as a result of this.
3. Stay positive.
It is important to stay positive and trust that things will get better. Students should remain confident that we will get back on campus in the fall as this a strong possibility due to a decline in COVID-19 cases and the rollout of new vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson. Virtual learning is not ideal for anyone — students and faculty alike — but we will get through this, and soon enough things will be back to normal. If you are struggling to stay positive, it is helpful to know that West Chester University has counseling services available through the school. Your advisor and school faculty are available to help you whenever you need them.
4. Create a schedule.
Many professors offer flexibility in terms of deadlines, and this is a great thing for students. In order to stay motivated and on track with your work, students should make a schedule and stick to it. Online classes allow you to make your own schedule, as many classes have asynchronous work sessions built into them, and this is a great way for students to remain on track and get their work done at their own pace.
5. Reward yourself. 
You should reward yourself for all the hard work you have completed during this difficult learning period. Go out and treat yourself to ice cream, take study breaks to watch Netflix, go out with friends and shop for yourself. These are just some of the ways you can pat yourself on the back for your hard work. Many students have taken gap years and have dropped out as a result of virtual learning, and if you are still going strong, you should be very proud of yourself. Remote learning is not for everyone, and it is certainly not what we signed up for when we enrolled at West Chester University. You should acknowledge the work you have completed and be proud of what you have been able to overcome.

806,"GORHAM -- Inside the First Parish Congregational Church, blue ribbons hang high on the left wall, the right wall, the front of the church, and in the back from the balcony.
So far, the ribbons number 1,100. Bea Brockman, a member of the church who cuts and sews the ribbons, will soon help hang 558 more, one for each of the 1,658 people who - as of Saturday - have died in Maine from COVID-19.
""I've got a lot of cutting up to do,"" Brockman said.
The sea of blue inside the church is striking. Several inches thick, some ribbons are 2 feet long, others are 3 feet long.
The ribbon remembrance project, led by pastor Christine Dyke, started in the spring of 2020 not long after the pandemic shut much of Maine down. ""We never thought we'd need to be doing this for so long,"" said the church's social media content manager, Karla Wheaton.
""It's a symbolic and a visual,"" Brockman said. The 1,100-plus ribbons make a statement of the number of lost lives in a way the statistics do not, she said. ""It's rather poignant.""
On Dec. 21 the church held a Blue Christmas service and posted it on YouTube and Facebook, explaining the ribbons were to honor each life lost in Maine from COVID-19.
""Person after person came back saying, 'That's my mother,' or 'There's a ribbon for my dad.' So it really has been a source of comfort to people whose relatives and friends have died,"" Brockman  said. ""Also for the rest of us to remind us this is ongoing. This isn't just a few people. There are so many.""
Now in it's second year, the project was begun because it's important to recognize the horrendous loss, the hurt, that so many are suffering, the pastor said.
""Even though we don't know their names, even though we've never met them, we take the losses seriously,"" Dyke said. ""It's part of our responsibility as people of faith to say, 'We witness your loss.'""
Too often society expects people who are grieving ""to do it quietly. Go on and be happy,"" Dyke said. By surrounding the interior of the church with ribbons, ""we're saying, 'No. This is not about being happy. This is about remembering other people's losses. And we are our siblings' keepers. That's what this is.""
Remembering individuals is meaningful, said Wheaton, adding that unfortunately she understands the pain too well. Her family is suffering a loss after her stepfather died last week.
""He didn't die from COVID, but he had COVID,"" Wheaton said. The elderly man was in a southern Maine assisted living facility. ""He fell, hit his head and had a brain bleed,"" she said, trying to hold back tears. In her grieving, ""I try to look at the positives,"" she said. ""The fact that everyone who comes in here thinks of these people, I'm sure it means a lot.""
Church member Marion Marsh, who at age 91 smiles as she shares that she's the oldest member of the congregation, approves of the blue strips hanging from the walls. ""I think it's absolutely wonderful. A beautiful thing to do."" As she sits in church, Marsh said she stares at the ribbons and wonders about the people they represent. Who were they? What were they like? ""Were they vaccinated?"" she said.
Wheaton said she and her husband were fully vaccinated, but she, her husband and their 4-year-old contracted COVID-19 in November. Worried about infecting others, they quarantined for weeks. ""Thankfully we were OK.""
The executive director of the Maine Council of Churches, the Rev. Jane Field, said she's not aware of another church symbolizing the loss of COVID-19 as the Gorham church is doing. ""This is the first time I've heard of it. It sounds absolutely stunning,"" Field said. ""It symbolizes such tragedy. It's powerful.""
On Jan. 4 the Maine Council of Churches issued a statement urging churches to offer virtual services during the omicron surge to reduce the spread, and to do what they can to support the beleaguered and exhausted health care workers in taking steps to promote safety. Pastors should be sending a clear message that getting vaccinated, boosted and wearing masks when in public are ""moral imperatives"" for anyone who follows the commandment to ""Love thy neighbor,"" Field said.
Field also encourages congregations to demonstrate compassion to those suffering in the pandemic. The ribbon remembrance project ""sounds like an extraordinary step in the same direction,"" Field said. ""I applaud their efforts.""
This Sunday the First Parish of Gorham will not hold a live service; the pastor has been exposed to the virus and is quarantining. The service will be online.
When the church does offer live services, worshippers must wear masks. The number of people in the building is limited, and rows of pews are closed to promote social distancing.
From the pulpit Dyke said she talks about the ribbons and the people they represent.
""On the back wall when the heating vents turn on, those ribbons dance,"" Dyke said. ""I always say something. 'They're dancing for us,' or 'Their spirit is present with us.'""
Until the pandemic is over, the church will continue to cut and hang ribbons, she said.
She looks forward to planning a closing ceremony when it's over. She'd love to invite survivors, attach real names to the ribbons. No ceremony is scheduled. ""We're not there yet,"" Dyke said.
""Hopefully it'll stop,"" Brockman said. ""Each time I say to Christine, 'We need more blue ribbon. The rolls come in 50 yards.""
At first the church ordered one roll at a time, Brockman said. ""Now she always orders two.""

A profile of four companies and how they are meeting the growing financial tech needs of businesses & consumers.

Due to the rapid rise offintech (financial technology) over the last two decades, nearly everyone has used some version of it to automate money movement online. These financial activities run the gamut, from collecting rent via PayPal to financing purchases via Affirm; from trading stocks via Robinhood to refinancing homes with Better Mortgage; from monitoring credit scores via Credit Karma to transferring money via Zelle; and many more.
Withfintech now poised to replace traditional financial services, cohesive partnerships are emerging that may ultimately work to make banking investing and lending money easier and more accessible for all moving forward.
Here's how four fintech companies in New Jersey are working toward a more inclusive future:
Cyborg Tech in Red Bank
According to SmartAsset, nearly 63% of investors are now comfortabie working remotely with financial advisors.
That's fantastic news for WBI investments, the 37-year old, family-owned investment advisory firm that created CyborgTech in 2019 to deliver ""Cy,"" a financial advisor-assisted robo advisory platform.
""While a financial advisor is going to know you and your family's needs and situations as they change, what beats a human money manager is the combination of man and machine,"" says Matthew Schreiber, co-CEO and chief investment strategist for WBI Investments and CEO of CyborgTech.
By seamlessly pairing human advice with machine-optimized portfolios, ""Cy"" recently won ""Best Robo Advisory Platform"" in the 5Ih annual FinTech Breakthrough Awards program.
""Although big banks might have such technology underneath their umbrella, we at CyborgTech can help smaller banks that need it, as what we've built is incredibly pliable,"" Ann Schreiber, chief marketing officer for WBI Investments and president of CyborgTech, says. ""It can plug into existing systems very easily.""
Additionally, since the average age of financial advisors in the US is near-ing 60, ""Cy"" had to be simple and easy to use, Matthew Schreiber says, while also addressing the flip side.
""These guys grew up in wire house settings, were trained incredibly well, and traded stocks for a long time,"" Schreiber continues. ""They have more market knowledge and field experience, and because we've been putting a lot of technology around the market these days, younger advisers typically don't have all that.""
Cross River Bank in Fort Lee
Founded in 2008 as a small community bank in Teaneck, Cross River Bank was recently recognized as the third-largest lender of Paycheck Protection Program loans during the pandemic, following JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America.
""Our average loan size in the first round was $33,000 compared to the national average of $101,000,"" Eden Hoffman, head of communications at Cross River, says, ""This showed that the money was truly going to small businesses in need.""
Now, as the second round comes to an end, Cross River has made more than 450,000 loans to small businesses nationwide, saving more than 2 million jobs in the process, explains Phillip Goldfeder, senior vice president of public affairs at Cross River.
How did they manage this?
""We merged the trust and reliability of community banking with the innovative offerings of a technology company,"" Goldfeder says. ""Today, we're powering the most successful fintech companies in the world.""
Shortly after its founding, Cross River entered into a technology partnership with GreenSky (point-of-sale consumer loans), with over 30 like-minded partnerships following soon thereafter.
""We are now the bank behind many fintech companies on the marketplace lending side, such as Affirm, Upstart and Rocket Loans; the consumer payment space, such as Stripe, Plaid and Remitly; and even in cryptocurrency exchange, such as Coinbase,"" Hoffman says.
Cross River also builds its own proprietary technology to ensure it keeps pace on the banking side as technology partners continue to evolve.
""We're not consumer facing, but we're the ones making sure the mechanisms work, that consumers are being protected, compliance is being followed, and that money is being moved safely,"" Goldfeder says.
Valley Bank in Wayne
Valley Bank in Wayne is embracing a culture of innovation that combines people, process and technology to drive their business forward. This innovative mindset is helping Valley design a more customer-centric culture. For instance, in 2020, the bank identified a need to make banking services for homeowners associations (HOAs) less time-consuming and more personalized.
Valley rolled out HOAValley.com, a fully integrated and intuitive online banking platform dedicated to serving the needs of HOAs and property managers. ""From specialized deposit products to online treasury solutions, Valley's dedicated online platform leverages some of the most innovative digital resources powered by a dedicated team ot bankers to help HOAs improve efficiencies and optimize cash flow,"" says Fareena Suri, innovation program manager at Valley.
This spirit of innovation is accelerating Valley's commitment to fin-tech partnerships. As Valley moves forward, it is leveraging its extensive experience in the real estate industry to partner with PropTechs-startups offering technologically innovative products or new business models for the real estate market. ""In fact, Valley is currently exploring investments in PropTech partnerships that will leverage the bank's extensive experience in the commercial real estate industry to help it become a thought leader in this space,"" Suri says. NJB
MoCaFi in Newark
While banking technology has existed for decades, the marginalization of minorities by financial institutions has existed for centuries.
""What's new is the ability for businesses like MoCaFi to reimagine technology, banking products, and services for communities that historically have not been served well by traditional banks to create real value, in ways that create scale and impact fairly quickly,"" says Wole Coaxum, founder and CEO of Mobility Capital Finance (MoCaFi).
According to Coaxum, there is real imperative, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased social justice, to more efficiently get dollars to large numbers of underbanked people.
""It is our hope that the moment has officially met our movement,"" Coaxum adds.
Sponsored by Sunrise Banks in St. Paul, Minnesota, MoCaFi's customer-facing, mobile-first financial inclusion platform currently partners with companies such as MasterCard and Galileo, a payment processor owned by SoFi, to onboard and solve the needs of under-banked individuals, who currently are in excess of 50% in black, brown and rural white communities.
Additionally, according to Bankrate, Black communities spend 50% more per month on banking services, while Latinx communities spend 100% more.
""The average Black person will spend $40,000 in excess fees over their working lifetime for banking services such as overdraft, out-of-network ATM, and check cashing fees,"" Coaxum says. ""Imagine if those fees could instead be invested.""
MoCaFi provides accessible and affordable bank accounts along with credit building assistance, especially for those working in the cash economy.
""People who are not typically part of the financial mainstream can use our platform to pay bills and rent, which we then use to help raise their credit with the traditional bureaus,"" Coaxum says.
Coaxum says MoCaFi has also been laser-focused on building financial literacy tools and partnerships with various capital providers for customers to better position themselves to become home and business owners.
""We are not simply a direct-to-con-sumer model - we partner with cities with place-based strategies to get dollars to individuals, too,"" Coaxum explains. ""This reduces costs for the cities while empowering individuals to become instruments of financial change in their communities.""
Founded in Harlem in 2016, MoCaFi relocated to Newark at the request of Newark Venture Partners in 2018. Recently, its staff of nearly 25 raised $12 million to attract 100,000 members within 12 munihs.

FinTech vs. Brick-and-Mortar Banking
Self Financial, March 2021: ""Local bank branches could become extinct by 2034 due to advancements in technology and greater access to the internet.""
However, more than 89% of Americans still use a banking company with physical branches to both deposit and access cash (91 %) and seek in-person financial advice (50%).

812,"After edging Champlain Valley on Saturday night, the BFA-St. Albans Bobwhites celebrated, posed for pictures — soaking in the moment on home ice, believing the Division I boys hockey trophy would remain theirs for another winter.
""We thought we won on Saturday,"" said senior captain Christian Vallee.
""We were told that was the championship,"" added junior defenseman Owen Benoit.
Then Essex, BFA's would-be next opponent, earned a lifeline. If the Hornets returned negative PCR results — after same-day COVD-19 testing — by an 11th-hour deadline, they would be medically cleared for Wednesday's title game.
Essex received its approval to play. BFA, though, wouldn't be fooled again.
Cashing in on all three power play opportunities, including a pair of first-period tallies, the No. 2 Bobwhites left Leddy Park with a 3-2 victory over No. 1 Essex to secure back-to-back titles and their fourth crown in five seasons.
BFA's 20th title in program history also ended a five-game winless skid to its biggest rival.
""We came down and showed them who the best team in the state was,"" Vallee said. ""We grinded it out.""
Vallee pocketed the opening strike, 24 seconds in, and Levi Webb knocked in a rebound chance later in the period, while Benoit's long-range wrister late in the final frame sealed the Bobwhites' second coronation in less than a week.
""Nothing is for sure right now with this league. But we're done, we are not playing anymore,"" quipped BFA coach Toby Ducolon.
The longtime BFA coach's humor in a post-game interview drew laughs. After winning their scheduled semifinal vs. CVU and thinking Essex wouldn't be eligible by Wednesday, then finding out otherwise, the Bobwhites deserved to crack a smile after a few trying days.
""It was hard on Essex on what they had to go through. It was extremely hard on us for the mess we went through this weekend,"" Ducolon said. ""For these guys to get it back together, mentally and physically, then be able to come out and perform on a Wednesday night — it's outstanding. I honestly don't know if I would've guessed it.
""I give them all the credit in the world. We had to play extremely well to beat them and we did.""
Essex players and coaches dealt with their own internal stress.
""I can just tell you even over the last 24 hours, the anxiety level of can we play or can we not play — that takes a little bit of energy away from you,"" Essex coach Chris Line said. ""But we were able to get ourselves here and put forth an effort, we just came up short.""
Without the ability to practice for over a week, Essex's slow start was noticeable. And BFA pounced immediately.
An Essex tripping penalty on the first shift set up the Bobwhites with a man-advantage. Given too much ice in front of him, Vallee wheeled toward net and guided a lefty wrister to the top corner for a 1-0 lead.
The Bobwhites (9-1) went back on the power play with 9:55 to play in the opening period. Applying pressure, Webb's fifth goal of the season came on a second effort. After the junior couldn't corral the puck, whiffing on a doorstep chance, Webb kept pursuing and deposited a rebound chance past Essex goalie Max Foster (17 saves) to double BFA's lead.
""We didn't have our legs, it took us a period to get into it,"" Line said. ""I give (BFA) a ton of credit, they did their homework on us, especially on the power play — they kind of exposed us.
""You just get out of your rhythm a little bit and you lose touches on the ice and it's hard to make up for that,"" Line added. ""There are no excuses here, we came to play, they came to play and unfortunately for us they came out on top.""
The Hornets (7-1) climbed back into the program's 24th title-game appearance on a fortuitous bounce. Max Line's slapshot zoomed wide, but ricocheted off the boards and back to Andrew Forcier, who had a tap-in on an open net at 10:31 of the second.
Essex's best chances to level the contest came off the stick of Braedon Hemenway early in the third. The junior defenseman couldn't slip a low shot past BFA goalie Michael Telfer (20 saves), who knocked away stick side. A minute later when Hemenway did squeeze one past Telfer, the puck dinged the cross bar.
""It's a game of bounces and a game of inches and sometimes they go your way and sometimes they don't,"" Line said.
A third Essex penalty, a second violation for tripping, gave way to Benoit's insurance tally. Using Aiden Savoy's screen, Benoit unloaded a blue-line wrister that rose over Foster's left shoulder for a 3-1 advantage with 4:31 to play.
""To score three goals on Essex, nobody's done that this winter. That's not an easy task,"" Ducolon said. ""They executed in the end, they really did. You have to get that last goal on the power play.
""You don't win a state final without executing. You can work hard, but you gotta execute.""
Max Line redirected a Tobias Martin slapshot for a 3-2 margin with 23 seconds to play, but the clock ran out on Essex.
""It was a hard-fought game, it always is against BFA, and it's always a team you love playing,"" Chris Line said. ""I love our group and would take them against any team, any day.""
After a D-I tournament that saw nearly as many forfeits as games played, Ducolon said he was happy his team was able to cross the finish line Wednesday night.
""A lot of teams didn't get a chance to even get here because of the COVID thing and because of some of the guidelines,"" Ducolon said. ""We were very fortunate.""
And the Bobwhites capped a strange season with a complete performance.
""To finish your last game with maybe your best game, it's hard to do. But this probably was our best game,"" Ducolon said. ""It was a great night for the green and gold for sure.""

813,"Things couldn't be going better for the Eagles in maximizing the value of their potential three first-round picks in the 2022 NFL draft.
The Miami Dolphins are a mess at 1-5, with the possibility of a top-5 draft pick very much alive after a trade with the Eagles that hasn't benefited Miami.
Former Eagles' quarterback Carson Wentz is on track to play 70% to 75% of the Colts' offensive snaps in order for the Eagles to get a first-round pick from Indianapolis instead of a second-rounder.
And at 2-4, the Eagles are just good enough where they could stay in contention for a possible playoff run, but not good enough to actually get one.
If the season ended today, the Eagles would hold picks No. 3 (Miami), No. 8 (their own) and No. 9 (Indianapolis) in the first round of the 2022 draft, according to Tankathon.com.
The season, of course, doesn't end today.
So, cover your eyes if you must over general manager Howie Roseman possibly messing up three first-round picks. But remember that Roseman might have engineered two of his best deals in his 10-plus years as a general manager to have that opportunity.
There are several things that could go wrong between now and the end of the season. What follows is a likely scenario for the Eagles to end up with three first-round picks:
The Dolphins
Last spring, the Eagles sent the No. 6 pick to Miami in return for the No. 12 pick and the Dolphins' first-round pick in 2022.
The Dolphins used that pick to select Alabama wide receiver Jaylen Waddle. When the Eagles were at No. 6, they would have been happy with either Waddle or his teammate, DeVonta Smith. They took a chance that one of them would be available at No. 12.
As it turned out, the Eagles traded up two spots with the Dallas Cowboys to draft Smith, giving up the third-round pick they acquired from the Colts (see below). There isn't a discernible difference in either player so far. Waddle has more catches (37 to 27), but Smith has more yards (345 to 301) and a much higher average yards per reception (12.8 to 8.1).
Likely outcome: As bad as the Dolphins are, they still have two games left against the Jets (1-4), and one each against the Atlanta Falcons (2-3), New England Patriots (2-4), Houston Texans (1-5) and Giants (1-5).
In other words, they could easily win three of those six games. The Eagles might not get a top-three pick, but they should end up with a top-5 pick.
All things considered, anything in the top 10 would be considered a bonanza after the Dolphins went 10-6 last season and just missed the playoffs.
The Colts
The Eagles traded Wentz last February in return for a third-round pick in 2021 and a second-round pick in 2022.
That second-round pick can become a first-round pick if Wentz plays 75% of the snaps and the Colts miss the playoffs, or 70% of the snaps and the Colts make the playoffs.
So far, Wentz has played 98.7% of the snaps. This is remarkable considering he had foot surgery in August, had to miss five days just before the season started as a close contact to someone with COVID-19 (Wentz is not vaccinated), and sprained both ankles in Week 2.
Likely outcome: There is no way that the Colts, who are 2-4, will keep playing Wentz if they're in line for a top-10 pick.
But the Colts are only 1.5 games behind the Tennessee Titans in the weak AFC South. If they can stay within two games of first place after 12 games, perhaps with a record of 5-7, then Wentz should get the required number of snaps to convert that pick into a first-rounder.
Then, as long as the Colts fall short of the playoffs and finish with a 7-10 or 8-9 record, the Eagles should end up with a top-15 pick. The Colts can stay close with upcoming games against the Jaguars (1-5) twice, the Texans (1-5) and Jets (1-4).
They also have tough games against the Buccaneers (5-1), Bills (4-1) and Cardinals (6-0).
The Eagles
The Eagles (2-4) are already three games behind the Cowboys in the NFC East, so winning the division is not likely. But it's still possible that the Eagles can make the playoffs as a wild card.
Of the Eagles' remaining games, two are against the Giants (1-5), two against Washington (2-4) and one against the Jets (1-4). The Eagles also face the Lions (0-6) on Oct. 31.
So it's possible the Eagles can stay in playoff contention over the final weeks of the season. That will at least keep the Eagles relevant in Nick Sirianni's first season as coach and with Jalen Hurts at quarterback.
Likely outcome: The Eagles end up with a top-5 pick (Dolphins), a top-10 pick (their own) and a top-15 pick (Colts).
Then they just have to decide if they're committed to Hurts as the franchise quarterback.
If they are, they can address their three biggest needs — offensive line, linebacker, secondary — with their first-round picks.
If not, they could package the Dolphins and Colts picks to move up into the top two or three and draft a franchise QB.

ABSTRACT-
Global Military Electro-Optics/Infrared Systems Market to Reach $16.3 Billion by 2026Electro-optical or EO systems refer to devices that make use of a mix of optics and electronics for generating, detecting and measuring radiation in the optical spectrum. The systems can measure electromagnetic spectrum with wavelengths in the 0.1-1000 micrometers range, which comprises visible light, infrared radiation and ultraviolet radiation. Electro optical systems or infrared systems constitute imaging systems primarily used by law enforcement and military departments for achieving better situational awareness of environments, during daytime and nights, and even in conditions of low light. Comprising of infrared sensors as well as electro-optical sensors, the EO systems are capable of offering precise optical data during the day and night. An electro-optical sensor is capable of changing light into electric signal, while the infrared sensor can identify any structure in its vicinity through the detection or emission of infrared radiation. EO or IR systems are used for airborne homeland security, surveillance, patrol, combat, search & rescue and reconnaissance programs primarily. Major features of the systems include image stabilization and long-range imaging capabilities. The sensors, typically equipped on vehicles or aircraft, are both hand-carried and deployed at sea. They work by identifying targets, tracking moving targets as well as ascertaining threats even from long distances and in difficult weather conditions and environments.
Amid the COVID-19 crisis, the global market for Military Electro-Optics/Infrared Systems estimated at US$12.8 Billion in the year 2022, is projected to reach a revised size of US$16.3 Billion by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 5.4% over the analysis period. Air, one of the segments analyzed in the report, is projected to grow at a 5.5% CAGR to reach US$11.5 Billion by the end of the analysis period. After a thorough analysis of the business implications of the pandemic and its induced economic crisis, growth in the Land segment is readjusted to a revised 4% CAGR for the next 7-year period. This segment currently accounts for a 18.3% share of the global Military Electro-Optics/Infrared Systems market. The airborne platform expected to drive the overall market. This is on account of the rising use in aerial warfare platforms (helicopters, fighter aircraft, and UAVs), and growing focus on battle field reconnaissance. Latest airborne warfare platforms are focusing on situational awareness and information superiority, and this is anticipated to drive investments in airborne EO/IR systems.
The U.S. Market is Estimated at $5.5 Billion in 2022, While China is Forecast to Reach $2.1 Billion by 2026The Military Electro-Optics/Infrared Systems market in the U.S. is estimated at US$5.5 Billion in the year 2022. The country currently accounts for a 42.51% share in the global market. China, the world second largest economy, is forecast to reach an estimated market size of US$2.1 Billion in the year 2026 trailing a CAGR of 6.9% through the analysis period. Among the other noteworthy geographic markets are Japan and Canada, each forecast to grow at 3.8% and 5.2% respectively over the analysis period. Within Europe, Germany is forecast to grow at approximately 4.6% CAGR while Rest of European market (as defined in the study) will reach US$2.3 Billion by the close of the analysis period.
The world market for military EO/IR systems is expected to register strong growth, supported by rising global focus on the aspects of security and safety, technological developments, and the requirement for better awareness of the battlefield among defense forces. Further, growing number of unmanned vehicles and the rising use of these systems in such vehicles for surveillance purposes, increasing defense spends, and strong requirement to improve military ISR capabilities are also driving gains in the market. The rising trend of miniaturization and growing accuracy of the systems in addition to their increased reliability and cost effectiveness are propelling the use of these systems in various applications. Research efforts in the area of third generation nonlinear crystals, forward-looking infrared, smart seekers and sensors, sophisticated 3D visualization, laser radars, and hyperspectral and multispectral sensors, and persistent surveillance systems are resulting in the development of better EO/IR systems, and this is positively impacting the market. Demand for EO/IR systems is also being encouraged by the NCW (Network Centric Warfare) doctrines, which are at different implementation stages in key militaries globally.
Naval Segment to Reach $2.6 Billion by 2026In the global Naval segment, USA, Canada, Japan, China and Europe will drive the 6.5% CAGR estimated for this segment. These regional markets accounting for a combined market size of US$1.5 Billion will reach a projected size of US$2.3 Billion by the close of the analysis period. China will remain among the fastest growing in this cluster of regional markets. More

823,"CHARLOTTE, N.C., Feb. 28, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Human resources is rapidly changing, but no other industry has faced as significant human capital management (HCM) challenges and changes as healthcare. In isolved's 2022 survey of over 500 HR leaders, medical and health industry respondents were more likely to say ""burnt out"" employees was the top retention challenge at their organization – more than any other field. Over a third (36 percent), however, rate their company's employee experience (EX) as average or poor- despite their staff being most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response, isolved is announcing isolved People Cloud™ for Healthcare Services, laser-focused to address critical areas like talent acquisition, human resources and payroll, workforce management and talent management.
isolved has an extensive and tenured footprint in the healthcare industry with over 10 years and 10 percent of its 145,000 employers served representing clinics, hospitals, long-term care facilities, care in the community and senior-living providers. Milestone Retirement Communities is one such customer, providing a range of caring and compassionate senior-housing options. A complex organization serving 40 retirement communities in 11 states, Milestone selected isolved in 2021 to have a single solution for recruiting, onboarding and payroll while eliminating manual tasks, managing complexity, improving self-service, achieving compliance and ensuring correct permissions across their 2,200 strong workforce.
""With isolved being the HCM technology of choice for every community, we're already beginning to see how People Cloud is helping us streamline employee experience,"" said Natalie Ross, executive vice president of human services at Milestone. ""isolved has been a very good choice for Milestone Retirement Communities.""
""With isolved, there is one customer success manager who stays with us regardless if it's a tax question, a payroll question or a hiring question,"" said David Sullivan, director of shared services at Milestone. ""The same person gets what they need from their colleagues but is the single point of contact for us, which helps enormously with support and our success. This ease of support has been a tremendous value-add to our selection of isolved.""
This combination of highly capable software (included in G2's 2022 Best Software Awards list for HR Software, based on positive customer feedback and company momentum), world-class support and, additionally, on-demand HR services, means that healthcare customers can be confident they have industry-specific technology and the support they need to deliver the services their employees and patients depend on. Seventy-eight percent of healthcare HR leaders say EX is a priority at their company with the number-one reason to improve retention rates.
""Existing HR technology has often lagged behind today's healthcare services needs,"" said James Norwood, chief marketing and strategy officer at isolved. ""isolved is meeting these new challenges with our packaged solutions for healthcare organizations. These providers shouldn't need to lose sleep over recruiting and compliance or advanced scheduling.

824,"The Federal Reserve Bank of New York issued the following remarks via videoconference on Feb. 18, 2022, by President and CEO at New Jersey City University:* * *I want to thank Sue Henderson for that kind introduction, and New Jersey City University for hosting today's discussion. I always enjoy speaking with students, and I look forward to the time-hopefully soon-when we can have these types of events in person.Today, our virtual setting is Jersey City, one of the most diverse cities in the world-and one known for terrific pizza. Now, it's not my place to get into the debate over who has the best pizza, and I know that people have strong views on that subject. As president of the New York Fed, I proudly represent both sides of the Hudson River, and my job is to make the economy stronger and the financial system more stable for all.Before I move on from the topic of pizza to economics, I should give the standard Fed disclaimer that the views I express today are mine alone. They do not necessarily reflect those of the Federal Open Market Committee-what we call the ""FOMC""-or others in the Federal Reserve System.As you well know, the economy-like many facets of our lives-continues to be shaped by the unpredictable nature of the coronavirus. As I've said before, the pandemic is first and foremost a health crisis. While omicron was milder for many-and thankfully the wave subsided relatively quickly-it still caused terrible hardship for countless families.You can see the economic effects of the pandemic right here in New Jersey. What struck me this week as I met with New Jersey business, community, and political leaders was the different ways that COVID-19 affects local economies. Just a few miles from Jersey City, Port Newark and Port Elizabeth are humming with activity. But across the Turnpike, Newark Liberty International Airport has seen a big reduction in the number of flights and passengers relative to pre-pandemic trends. Likewise, the pandemic has led to empty office buildings and fewer travelers in New York City, which affects businesses here in New Jersey as well.Today I'm going to talk about how the economy has continued to recover despite the many disruptions and imbalances that COVID-19 has caused. I'll also discuss the labor market and the rise in inflation. Then, I'll describe how the Federal Reserve's monetary policy is working to help restore balance and stability to the economy during these uncertain times.Economic OutlookSince it's the Friday before a holiday weekend, I won't test any of you on the functions of the Federal Reserve System. But I do want to take a moment to discuss the Fed's dual mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability. U.S. monetary policy is set by the FOMC, which is made up of the Board of Governors and five of the 12 presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks.We make our decisions after studying the data-lots of data. We look at everything from food and gas prices to retail sales and inventories, from labor costs and employment figures to semiconductor inventories and shipping expenses, and from the demand for goods and services to readings on public health.And we consider more than just numbers on spreadsheets and charts. We also regularly hear from business and community leaders who tell us firsthand what is happening in the economy. This occurs both through regular meetings with our Boards of Directors and advisory groups, as well as in ongoing discussions with local leaders. That is why it's so important for me to make trips like this one-even virtually-so I can meet with leaders to hear their perspectives. For example, earlier today I spoke with officials at the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal about supply chains and logistics. And yesterday, I met with groups in North Jersey who are working to bridge the gap in health outcomes and housing-two critically important issues that can affect economic mobility.Despite the disruptions from COVID-19, the overall economy has shown remarkable strength and resilience over the past year. To put this in perspective, the onset of the pandemic in 2020 caused the sharpest U.S. economic contraction since World War II. Since then, we have seen a remarkable turnaround. The economy, measured by real gross domestic product, or GDP, grew about 5-1/2 percent over the course of last year, the fastest pace of growth since 1984. To get an idea how long ago that was, 1984 was the year I finished college.The labor market has also improved dramatically and is now very strong. Over the past 12 months through January, the economy added over 6-1/2 million jobs. The unemployment rate has fallen from the pandemic peak of 14.7 percent to just 4 percent today. In fact, there are many more job openings now than there are people looking for work. Another clear sign of the hot labor market is that wages rose sharply last year, especially for lower-paid jobs.InflationI mentioned earlier that the Federal Reserve has two goals: maximum employment and price stability. The very strong labor market is great news in terms of achieving maximum employment. However, we have seen inflation rise to a level that's far too high. Ten years ago, the FOMC set a longer-run goal of 2 percent inflation-that is, prices rising 2 percent per year on average./1 From 2012 through 2020, inflation averaged below this 2 percent goal. But the inflation rate started rising sharply in 2021. The Fed's preferred price measure, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, rose 5-3/4 percent last year, its highest reading since the early 1980s.This sudden, sharp rise in prices reflects a unique set of circumstances that has driven supply and demand out of balance. For those of you who have studied economics, you will not be surprised that I ascribe this rise in inflation to demand outpacing supply. But, the rapidly changing situation of the past two years has been extraordinary, and it is worth discussing in some detail.After the onset of the pandemic, Americans shifted their spending from services to goods, spending less on restaurants, vacations, and entertainment, and more on things like cars, appliances, and furniture. As businesses tried to meet the surge in demand for goods, distribution channels backed up. Supply-chain bottlenecks and shortages emerged, both here and abroad. Too many ships arrived at the ports-particularly those in California. When the ships were finally able to dock, there weren't enough workers and drivers to unload and transport goods to stores-or to people's homes.In addition, we have seen a large pullback in the number of people willing and able to work, in part reflecting the challenges and risks of working during the pandemic. Some businesses can't hire people fast enough to help meet the strong demand. This has contributed to an acceleration in wages and higher prices for a variety of goods and services, including food and housing. High inflation is hardest on those already struggling to make ends meet.The Fed's ResponseThis brings me to the outlook for the economy and monetary policy. As I said earlier, demand for goods and some services is now far outstripping supply, resulting in elevated inflation. With the labor market already very strong, it's important to restore the balance between supply and demand and bring inflation down. A number of factors should help accomplish this rebalancing, and monetary policy has an important role to play.First, with the omicron wave now ebbing and COVID vaccines and treatments much more widely available across the globe, we should see a gradual restoration of supply and a resolution of associated bottlenecks and shortages. Over time, consumers should also start to cut back on buying goods that are in short supply and switch back to in-person activities like travel, dining, and entertainment, where supply is less constrained overall. Together, these developments should contribute to more balance between supply and demand in the economy.The second factor is fiscal policy, which provided a huge boost to the economy during the past two years but is unlikely to be as significant a source of demand this year. This is true not only for the United States, but also for many other economies.Last-but definitely not least-is monetary policy. After providing maximum support to the economy for the first year and half of the pandemic, the FOMC is adjusting the stance of monetary policy with the aim of bringing demand in balance with supply and thereby bringing down inflationary pressures. The same is true for many other central banks, which either already have moved in this direction or are expected to this year.The initial step in that process was the FOMC's decisions to first reduce, and then end, its net purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities./2 These purchases pushed longer-term interest rates lower, making it less costly for consumers and businesses to borrow, and contributed to favorable overall financial conditions that supported spending.The next step will be to raise the FOMC's target range for the federal funds rate the short-term interest rate at which banks lend to each other. In March 2020, the FOMC reduced the target range for the federal funds rate by 1-1/2 percentage points to near zero. This very low interest rate contributed to the sharp rebound in demand, which propelled the strong labor market recovery over the past year.But with today's strong economy and inflation that is well above our 2 percent longer-run goal, it is time to start the process of steadily moving the target range back to more normal levels. In particular, I expect it will be appropriate to raise the target range at our upcoming meeting in March.Once the interest rate increases are underway, the next step will be to start the process of steadily and predictably reducing our holdings of Treasury and mortgage-based securities, which had grown significantly as a result of the purchases that began in March 2020. Last month, the FOMC released a set of principles that will guide that process./3 Assuming the economy develops roughly as I expect, I foresee this process getting started later this year.Taken together, these two sets of actions steadily raising the target range for the federal funds rate and steadily bringing down our securities holdings-should help bring demand closer to supply. In fact, even though we haven't done either of these things yet, financial conditions have already responded based on the expectation of Fed action. For example, medium- and longer-term Treasury yields and fixed-rate mortgage rates have risen close to their December 2019 levels. Of course, our actions will be driven by the data and a determination to achieve our maximum employment and price stability goals.With these three factors working together to restore balance between supply and demand, I am confident we will achieve a sustained, strong economy and inflation at our 2 percent longer-run goal. For this year, I look forward to continued growth and receding inflation, both for the nation and North Jersey. Specifically, my forecast for the U.S. economy is for real GDP to grow a bit below 3 percent this year, for the unemployment rate to end the year around 3-1/2 percent, and for PCE price inflationto drop back to around 3 percent, before falling further next year as supply issues continue to recede.ConclusionSince the onset of the pandemic two years ago, this has an extraordinary time for the economy and monetary policy. As we work to help restore balance to the economy and bring down inflation, our actions will always be driven by the data, and we will remain focused on achieving maximum employment and price stability.Footnotes: 1/ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Statement on Longer-Run Goals and Monetary Policy Strategy, as adopted effective January 24, 2012.2/ See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement, November 3, 2021; Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement, December 15, 2021; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Reserve Issues FOMC Statement, January 26, 2022.3/ Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet, January 26, 2022.MSTRUCK-7750749 MSTRUCK",N.Y.

825,"With the city facing fiscal challenges and pressing needs, Madison 
Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway on Tuesday proposed a whopping $355.3 
million capital budget for 2022 with more funds for affordable 
housing to combat homelessness, supporting small businesses and 
starting to build bus rapid transit.
The city's economy is recovering, but many residents continue to be 
disproportionately affected by the effects of the pandemic on their 
work, their housing and their economic security, Rhodes-Conway 
said. ""The city is working to support residents and businesses that 
are struggling and address the underlying inequities in our 
community."" 
The mayor's proposal includes no unexpected, big-ticket 
investments, but the capital budget, dramatically inflated by the 
start of the largely federally funded first phase of BRT, is the 
city's largest ever, more than doubling the current year's $166.4 
million plan.
""Most of this is federal money coming to the city that would not be 
repaid with property tax dollars,"" city finance director David 
Schmiedicke said. 
Rhodes-Conway uses a blend of local and a lot of outside money to 
advance shelter for the homeless, more lower-cost housing and 
initiatives to support home ownership, opportunities to start and 
grow businesses, and the start of construction of BRT, a 
high-frequency, high-capacity, limited-stop service that would run 
60-foot-long buses on city streets and dedicated lanes with special 
stations.
The proposal also includes $3.3 million to extend services to the 
town of Madison, much of which will be absorbed by the city on Oct. 
31, 2022. The investments will be for loans to developers for 
lower-cost housing, land purchases and other loans and grants, 
equipment to support street services, recycling and refuse carts 
and additional voting equipment.
The budget would reconstruct Atwood and University avenues and the 
John Nolen Drive bridges, invest $16.5 million to acquire electric 
vehicles for the Public Works Department and $2.25 million to 
convert all city-owned street lights to high-efficiency LEDs. It 
would deliver continuing funds to the city's Safe Streets Madison 
and Twenty is Plenty programs intended to eliminate traffic deaths 
and severe injuries on city streets by 2030.
The city, now in the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic and its 
economic fallout, is getting a much-needed boost with $47.2 million 
in federal American Rescue Plan Act money. The City Council has 
already approved a plan to use $22.8 million for violence 
prevention and youth engagement, homelessness, affordable housing, 
emerging needs, including assisting undocumented residents, and 
economic development.
The proposed budget provides $9.75 million to projects outlined in 
the plan, including converting a hotel to housing, housing for 
homeless youth, and energy improvements to older housing.
The federal funds are ""absolutely transformational"" for the capital 
and upcoming operating budget proposals for 2022, Rhodes-Conway 
said.
The mayor said she asked a staff team to analyze all projects and 
programs with an eye toward racial equity, environmental 
sustainability, long-range planning, health and safety, limited 
fiscal impacts, feasibility and timing.
The budget ""reflects the needs of our community and balances them 
with the resources available,"" she said.
City Council president Syed Abbas said the proposed capital budget 
""looks good but there is room for improvement."" He applauded BRT, 
electric vehicles, library and park investments, as well as 
affordable housing initiatives, but said the city needs even more 
investment in lower-cost housing and the purchase of land for 
future redevelopment, which ""can generate wealth for people of 
color and disconnected communities."" 
BRT construction
The $166 million price tag for the first phase of BRT, due to run 
roughly from East Towne to West Towne, is easily the single most 
expansive item in the capital budget, matching this year's entire 
capital budget. Construction on the system is expected to start in 
late 2022 and continue through 2024.
The sum includes about $23.5 million in previous appropriations, 
use of city-owned property that serves as a match for federal 
grants, and future debt payments on planned borrowing, plus $142.5 
million next year that will cover roadway modifications, station 
construction, easements and vehicles. The BRT budget includes 
$115.8 million in federal funding for 2022.
The mayor's budget also envisions spending $4 million in 2023 to 
design and implement a second BRT route from South Park Street to 
Northport Drive.
""It's been 30 years since Madison started talking about rapid 
transit,"" Rhodes-Conway said. ""It's high time we're moving ahead 
with it.""
She's also providing $120,000 to help plan for the eventual return 
of Amtrak train service to Madison.
Focus on housing
The budget also relies on federal funds from the American Rescue 
Plan, especially in addressing homelessness and housing.
Specifically, the plan calls for using $2.5 million to convert 
hotels to housing; $2.5 million to buy the Salvation Army of Dane 
County's property at 3030 Darbo Drive, which would help support the 
nonprofit's $30 million redevelopment of facilities on the 600 
block of East Washington Avenue and give the city a facility to 
serve the Darbo-Worthington neighborhood; and $2 million for 
housing for homeless youth.
The federal funds would also provide $500,000 in lending to support 
home ownership and rehab, and $250,000 for energy efficiencies in 
older housing, which is often cheaper than new housing.
Meanwhile, the mayor would boost the Affordable Housing Fund from 
$6.27 million in the current year to $7 million in 2022, and would 
sustain the $7 million contribution annually through 2027. She 
would increase the affordable housing consumer lending program by 
$1.65 million to a total $3.7 million, and boost funding for a 
permanent men's homeless shelter by $1 million to $4 million in 
2022, for a total project budget, including money from Dane County, 
of $10 million.
""Housing remains a critical priority for our community, and I 
propose to increase affordable housing and home ownership to those 
who need assistance the most,"" the mayor said.
The proposed budget provides $2 million for a Small Business Equity 
and Recovery program, $500,000 less than the current year when 
funds rose to respond to the pandemic, but would fund the effort on 
a continuing basis, including $500,000 annually starting in 2024 
when no money was envisioned, Schmiedicke said. It also increases 
funds for the Healthy Retail Access Program, which offers grants to 
projects that improve access to affordable, healthy and culturally 
appropriate food, he said.
'Horizon list'
The mayor placed several projects on the ""horizon list"" for 
projects that meet a clear community purpose but are not yet 
fleshed out enough to be included in the nonbinding, five-year 
Capital Improvement Plan.
Those include:
* $22 million to replace the Lake Street parking garage until an 
updated funding structure is completed that may include 
partnerships with the private sector on a larger redevelopment.
* 
At least $16.1 million for a new Elver Park Community Center and 
$1.2 million to replace the Brittingham Beach House.
* $5.7 
million to implement the Vilas Park master plan, which would 
deliver a new main park shelter, new open shelters, a renovated 
beach bathhouse on Lake Wingra and more.
Debt costs
Overall, the proposed capital budget is $188.8 million more than 
the current year. It includes $142.8 million in borrowing and 
$212.5 million from other sources.
The city will have an additional $63.5 million in reauthorizations 
for previously approved projects such as the permanent homeless 
men's shelter.
The city's annual debt costs have risen from 12% of the general 
fund budget in 2011 to roughly 17% in the current year and about 
the same in 2023.
The nonbinding, five-year Capital Improvement Plan shows the 
capital budget falling from $355.3 million in 2022 to $128 million 
in 2024 before rising to $193 million in 2027.
The city's Finance Committee will consider amendments to the plan 
in September. Rhodes-Conway will propose an operating budget on 
Oct. 5, with Finance Committee consideration of amendments later 
that month. The full council will decide both budgets the week of 
Nov. 8.

826,"(TNSJou) -- Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School issued the following news release:Antibodies and T cells are components of the human immune system that directly act against viral infections and eliminate infected cells. A new study by scientists from Duke-NUS Medical School, provides evidence that an early presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells in COVID-19 is likely to prevent severe disease. The study, published in Cell Reports, has important implications for the clinical management of COVID-19 patients.Humoral and cellular adaptive immunity are two immune mechanisms that act against pathogens. Humoral immunity is mediated by antibodies, while cellular immunity does not involve antibodies and is, instead, facilitated by T cells. Studying how these immune mechanisms mediate SARS-CoV-2 infections could be beneficial in controlling the progression of the disease. However, their roles in viral control or disease pathogenesis is not fully understood and only a few studies have thoroughly monitored COVID-19 patients longitudinally, especially during the acute phase of infection. To fill this knowledge gap, the team of researchers at Duke-NUS investigated the changes in virological and immunological parameters in 12 patients with symptomatic acute SARS-CoV-2 infection from onset of the disease to recovery or death. ""We found that patients who control SARS-Cov-2 infection with only mild symptoms are characterised by an early induction of IFN-Gamma secreting SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells. The amount of humoral response, however, does not predict the level of COVID-19 disease severity,"" said Dr Anthony Tanoto Tan, Senior Research Fellow at the Duke-NUS' Emerging Infectious Diseases (EID) programme and the co-author of this study. ""Our data supports the idea that SARS-CoV-2 specific T cells play an important role in the rapid control of viral infection and eventual clearance of the disease,"" added Dr Martin Linster, Senior Research Fellow with Duke-NUS' EID programme and the co-author of this study. This work is a continuation of the team's previous publication in Nature, where they analysed SARS-CoV-2 specific T cell response in COVID-19 patients at convalescence. In this study, they have expanded the analysis to the full timeline of SARS-CoV-2 infection from onset to outcome.""It is time that T cell monitoring should be considered in providing a comprehensive understanding of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. This would also mean that a vaccine will likely be more effective if a holistic induction of both antibodies and T cells occurs,"" said Professor Antonio Bertoletti, from Duke-NUS' EID programme, who is the corresponding author of this study.""This important study furthers our understanding of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2. It has far-reaching implications including on COVID-19 vaccine design and the subsequent monitoring of vaccine response,"" said Professor Patrick Casey, Senior Vice-Dean for Research at Duke-NUS.The team is now studying more symptomatic COVID-19 patients with varying disease severity to further validate their findings.* * *JOURNAL: Cell ReportsMSTRUCK-7370268 MSTRUCK",Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School: Early Functional SARS-CoV-2 Specific T Cell Response May Prevent Severe Infection
827,"More than 300 pounds of bologna and dozens of boxes of horse medication were recently seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at the Paso Del Norte Bridge in Downtown El Paso. A 20-year-old El Paso man was issued a $1,000 civil fine in the border bologna bust last week, CBP officials said this week. On the morning of Aug. 26, a CBP officer spotted large lunch meat rolls in the back seat of a 2012 Honda Odyssey arriving from Mexico, a CBP news release stated. CBP said that the driver was asked if he had any fruits, vegetables, meats, plants or animals to declare, responded ""no"" and was sent to a secondary inspection. CBP officers pulled rolls of lunch meat from under blankets, the center console, under the seats and inside a duffle bag, CBP stated. CBP agriculture specialists seized a total of 320 pounds of pork bologna and 30 pounds of turkey ham. The meats were destroyed by CBP. The driver told officers that the bologna was intended for resale in the United States, CBP stated. It is not uncommon for Mexican bologna — which can taste different from U.S. brands— to be smuggled into the U.S., where it can sell for several times than its purchase price in Mexico. Foreign pork products are banned because of the potential to introduce animal diseases, CBP said. Horse medication seized In a separate case, CBP officers seized dozens of boxes of prescription horse medication and animal supplements Tuesday at the Paso Del Norte international bridge. A 44-year-old U.S. citizen driving in from Mexico declared he had vitamins but an inspection found the vitamins were livestock veterinary medication, CBP said. The medications were prohibited from entry because they are considered a restricted narcotic steroid, CBP said. The driver was issued a $500 civil fine. It is not uncommon for CBP officers to make such horse medication seizures in El Paso during the New Mexico horse racing season, CBP spokesman Roger Maier said. Maier added that the seized veterinary medication did not include ivermectin, an anti-parasite farm-animal medication that is a risky, unproven treatment for COVID-19. The Food and Drug Administration recently warned against self-medicating with medicine intended for animals. The anti-parasitic treatment has lead to a spike in poison control calls in Texas.

828,"The Biden administration is opening an overflow facility for unaccompanied migrant children apprehended at the US-Mexico border, the federal agency tasked with the children's care told CNN in a statement.
The Health and Human Services Department will reopen a facility in Carrizo Springs, Texas, that can accommodate about 700 children and can be expanded if necessary.
The reopening of the facility comes amid an increase in apprehensions of unaccompanied children on the Southwest border, fueled in part by deteriorating conditions in Latin America and a perceived possible relaxation of enforcement, and reduced capacity limits at other facilities due to Covid-19. It also comes as President Joe Biden rolls out new immigration executive orders tackling migration to the US southern border.
Unaccompanied children who cross the border are taken into custody by the Department of Homeland Security and referred to HHS, though a Trump-era policy also makes them subject to expulsion. If placed in care, case managers work to place a child with a sponsor in the United States, like a parent or relative.
The facility in Carrizo Springs will be used for children who are medically cleared from Covid-19 quarantine and will not be used for those younger than 13, according to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the agency within HHS that is responsible for the care of migrant children.
As of Thursday, there were approximately 4,730 children in Office of Refugee Resettlement care.
""HHS is mindful of these children's vulnerability, and our priority is the safety and wellbeing of each child in our care. HHS anticipates the need to start placing children at Carrizo Springs in 15 days or soon after,"" the agency said in a statement, citing limited capacity due in part to Covid-19.
Since the start of the pandemic, the agency has also had to contend with Covid-19 infections among children and staff. As of last week, there have been a total of 1,748 Covid-19 cases among children, the majority of whom have recovered and been moved from medical isolation. More than 21,000 coronavirus tests have been completed for children in the program, according to the agency.
No children who tested positive have required hospitalization, the agency said.
""The situation remains extremely fluid and can change rapidly,"" the Office of Refugee Resettlement said in a statement.
A White House spokesperson said that it's not this administration's policy to expel children apprehended at the border, a departure from the Trump administration's posture. ""The Border Patrol will continue to transfer unaccompanied children to the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement so they may be properly cared for in appropriate shelters, consistent with their best interest,"" the spokesperson said.
The Department of Homeland Security is also beginning to expand its processing capacity. US Customs and Border Protection, for example, is building soft-sided structures in Donna, Texas, to provide processing capacity in the Rio Grande Valley, one of the busiest regions for illegal border crossings, due to a nearby processing center being closed because of renovation.
While fluctuations in migration flows are common, the coronavirus pandemic complicates the usual procedures.
Trump policies can't all be reversed quickly
Under President Donald Trump, the US-Mexico border operated under hardline policies intended to keep migrants out of the United States, including a policy that required asylum seekers to stay in Mexico until their court dates in the US and a public health order allowing quick expulsion of migrants encountered by border agents.
Moves to increase capacity and shelter for migrants are indicative of one of the looming challenges for the Biden administration -- more migrants at the border -- but also signal a shift from the Trump administration's posture of turning everyone away.
While administration officials have condemned Trump's actions, they're still relying on them as they sort out next steps and urging patience as they work to reverse them.
""The executive orders that were rolled out on day one and (Tuesday) is just the beginning,"" said a senior administration official. ""Fully remedying these actions will take time and require a full government approach, but President Biden has been very clear about restoring compassion and order to our immigration system.""
In the absence of information over when border policies will be pulled back, immigrant advocates and attorneys, who work directly with migrants along the southern border, have been scrambling to get clarity to advise people, many of whom are in life or death situations.
Linda Rivas, an immigration attorney and director of Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, a group that represents people in the so-called ""Remain in Mexico"" program, has been trying to console her clients this week, including a Honduran mother who said she had been raped while waiting in Mexico under the Trump-era policy and is now concerned for her 11-year-old son.
""Definitely a loss of hope,"" Rivas said. ""The trauma they are enduring is unimaginable.""

June's inflation index jumped 5.4% from a year ago, the highest reading since August 2008. The experts were surprised. Clearly, Federal Reserve watchers never bothered to consult Milton Friedman. Lost is a core Friedman dictum: ""Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.""
In his Feb. 23 testimony to Congress, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that the growth in the money supply, specifically M2, ""doesn't really have important implications."" The experts, the press and the bond vigilantes were as quick to unlearn monetarism, if they ever had learned it, as Mr. Powell. Reporting about U.S. inflation rarely contains the words ""money supply."" We are repeatedly told that the most recent upticks in inflation are anomalous and ""transitory.""
Wrong. The inflation upticks aren't temporary and were predictable, driven by an extraordinary explosion in the money supply. Since March 2020, the M2 has been growing at an average annualized rate of 23.9%—the fastest since World War II. There is so much money out there that banks don't know what to do with it. Via reverse repurchase agreements, banks and money-market funds are lending money to the Fed to the tune of $860 billion. That's unprecedented.
According to monetarism, asset-price inflation should have occurred with a lag of one to nine months. Then, with a lag of six to 18 months, economic activity should have started to pick up. Lastly, after a lag of 12 to 24 months, generalized inflation should have set in. That's the standard monetarist sequence, and it's been followed to a T.
To get a handle on what the recent money supply explosion implies for inflation, consider a monetarist model for determining national income. That famous model was displayed on Milton Friedman's California license plates. It's compact: MV=Py, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money (the speed at which it circulates), P is the price level, and y is real gross domestic product.
Plug numbers into the model and solve for M, and money supply (M2) should be growing at around 6% a year for the Fed to hit its inflation target of 2%. With M2 growing at nearly four times the ""ideal"" rate since March 2020, inflation is baked into the cake, and it's likely to persist. By the end of the year, the year-over-year inflation rate will be at least 6% and possibly as high as 9%.
Some who like to throw cold water on monetarism argue that the velocity of money has collapsed and will mitigate the inflationary impact of the rapid growth of the money supply. While velocity did collapse with the onset of Covid, it's on track to pick up until the end of 2024. Consequently, velocity will grease the monetary wheels. That's why inflation might hit the high end of our forecast range.
Mr. Powell and his colleagues should start paying attention to the money supply. Money matters. Indeed, it dominates.

837,"(TNSRep) -- South Dakota State University issued the following news:The South Dakota Covid-19 Family Impact Survey 2021 was conducted from July 31st to August 14th, 2021 by The SDSU Poll, a research group housed in the School of American and Global Studies at South Dakota State University. This survey builds upon similar surveys conducted by The SDSU Poll in October 2020 and April 2021. In this poll, a total of 573 registered voters in South Dakota completed our survey about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their daily lives. The margin of error of this survey was +/- 4 %, on par with other state-wide polls.Half of South Dakotans Believe COVID-19 Originated in a Laboratory in ChinaThe origin of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 remains unclear. Some scientists believe that it was transmitted from animals to humans and thus has a natural zoonotic origin. Others believe the virus was engineered at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China and escaped from the laboratory. The unwillingness of the Chinese government to share information and to give international researchers access to data have certainly contributed to the uncertainty over the origins of the virus. President Biden authorized intelligence agencies to investigate the matter. However, the report yielded inconclusive results on whether the virus was spread to humans through exposure to an indicated animal or a laboratory-related incident. As part of our survey, we asked South Dakotans on their beliefs on the origin of the virus, particularly if they believed that the virus originated in a laboratory in China.Our results show that just over half of South Dakotans (53%) believe that COVID-19 probably or definitely was created in a lab in China. Nearly one in five (18%) said that the theory that COVID-19 originated in a lab was probably or defiantly not true. The rest (29%) said they were not sure.The survey results also reveal that South Dakotans' opinions about the origin of COVID-19 are related to their level of education. About 60% of South Dakotans with less than a 4-year degree say COVID-19 is probably or definitely created in a lab in China, compared to 45% of those with a 4-year degree or higher. The percentage of participants with less than a 4-year degree say idea that the COVID-19 was developed in a lab is probably or defiantly false (15%) is smaller than those with a 4-year degree or higher (22%). Respondents with less than a 4-year degree who say they are not sure about the origin of the COVID-19 (26%) is smaller than those with a 4-year degree or higher (32%). While researchers debate the exact causal mechanisms at work, this finding is consistent with extensive research that shows a link between the acceptance conspiratorial explanations and lower levels of education. These differences reach what researchers call ""statistical significance,"" however they are not the primary driver of these attitudes in South Dakota.The survey finds that political affiliation strongly shapes South Dakotans' beliefs about the origin of COVID-19, as it does with many COVID-19-related topics we have examined in SDSU polls. A large share of Republicans in South Dakota (76%) say COVID-19 was probably or definitely created in a lab in China compared to 16% of Democrats. Just over one-third of Democrats (36%) and 6% of Republicans say this notion is definitely or probably false. Nearly half of Democrats (48%), and 18% of Republicans say they are not sure. Not a single Republican in our sample of 573 registered voters was willing to state that the possibility of COVID-19 emerging from a Chinese lab was definitely false. These results reinforce our consistent finding in all of our polls that partisanship is structuring most matters on COVID-19, be they policies on mitigation or best practices on prevention. In the instance of virus origin, this is undoubtedly a result of the rhetorical strategy of President Trump who constantly emphasized the Chinese origins of the virus to frame the pandemic as a foreign threat, and the current conservative media environment that highlights the secrecy and obstruction of Chinese officials on this question.In our final press releases we will look at the psychological effects of COVID-19 on South Dakotans and return to our roots as political scientists to look at how prominent South Dakota politicians are faring in the eyes of the public and their parties.See charts here: https://www.sdstate.edu/news/2021/09/south-dakotans-thoughts-origins-covid-19* * *REPORT: https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Unclassified-Summary-of-Assessment-on-COVID-19-Origins.pdfMSTRUCK-7610406 MSTRUCK",South Dakotans' Thoughts on the Origins of COVID-19

March 17, 2021
Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare via EmailPrint
It’s been over a year since San Diego State men’s basketball was stripped of its chances to compete in the NCAA Tournament due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
It’s also been three years since the Scarlet and Black have competed in the Big Dance.
In 2018, the then-No. 11 Aztecs lost in the first round in heartbreak to No. 6 Houston and a name that leaves a sour taste in the mouths of SDSU fans: Rob Gray.
Now, the Aztecs have finally managed to make their way back to one of the biggest stages in all of sports.
This time as a No. 6 seed, SDSU will face a pesky No. 11-seeded opponent in Syracuse this Friday.
A 30-2 season that came to an abrupt halt was followed up with a 23-4 season, highlighted by a Mountain West Conference title and MWC tournament championship.
Head coach Brian Dutcher said he’s glad to be back in the NCAA Tournament, although he feels for three in particular who weren’t able to return in 2020-21.
“In the case of Yanni (Wetzell), Malachi (Flynn) and KJ Feagin, they had a one-year window,” Dutcher said. “They played  wonderful college careers and never played in the NCAA Tournament one time, so I was heartbroken for that more than anybody else.
“I told the guys that came back, we‘ll have a chance to do it again next year. And here we sit, we found a way to do it. So they‘re going to get an opportunity to play.”
Senior guard Jordan Schakel said he knew he would be back in the tournament and was hurting more for his graduating teammates than himself in 2020.
“For me, personally, there was not any pain because I knew I was going to have a chance this year,” Schakel said. “For the guys that graduated last year and waited their whole careers to get to the tournament, I think that‘s where the pain was. We feel blessed that we have another opportunity to play the game we love and get to the tournament at the biggest stage.”
The Aztecs ended last season in a conference tournament championship game loss to Utah State. Little did SDSU know that would be the last time it would play in a game before the pandemic.
Following this year’s conference tournament title game win over the Aggies, senior forward Matt Mitchell said it’s a chance for him and the upperclassmen to get redemption.
“Last year is still a little bittersweet,” Mitchell said. “But I think it (making the tournament this year) kind of does, in a sense, wash it away for the older guys.”
This year’s tournament will also look different from that in years past.
March Madness will be held in one city, Indianapolis, with players required to socially distance, wear masks, practice at designated times and quarantine anytime they aren’t participating in basketball activities.
The team was even separated Sunday when NCAA Tournament seeds were announced.
Dutcher and the student-athletes had to watch the Selection Show over Zoom rather than in-person.
“It‘s surreal — we got tested and we‘re in a room,” Dutcher said Sunday. “We cannot leave our rooms. We test again first thing in the morning and if we get two negative tests, we can start doing a few things together as a team, so everything‘s a challenge.”
Although there are strict protocols in place, the Aztecs will get to play in front of fans — something they weren’t able to do at Viejas Arena this season.
Schakel said having fans in basketball venues is one of the biggest reasons he plays the game.
“It’s going to be fun to get to play in front of fans and that is part of the reason why we play basketball,” Schakel said. “I am looking forward to it and I will have my parents in attendance for sure.”
The tournament will look different this year, but brackets are finally back and so are the Aztecs.
It’s finally March. Let the Madness begin.

844,"Nov. 11 - Lansing  -  The Republican-controlled Michigan Legislature is urging a federal court to halt President Joe Biden's policy that requires millions of American workers to become fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or undergo weekly testing, according to a brief filed Wednesday.
Michigan GOP lawmakers painted the stakes surrounding the policy as resounding, while supporters have argued it will protect workers against the spread of a deadly virus.
The mandate cannot continue and would be ""the death knell of the American dream,"" contended Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, R-Clarklake, in a statement.
Hoping to block the new standard, attorneys general in Kentucky, Ohio and Tennessee have challenged the rule from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals. The Michigan House and Senate submitted a brief in support of the other states.
""It is an unjustified expansion of the federal government's authority to address occupational hazards and, with that expansion, an unprecedented intrusion into the sovereign police power historically reserved to the states,"" the Michigan Legislature's filing argued.
On Saturday, the 5th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals granted an emergency stay of the vaccine and testing requirement in a separate case.
The federal government's policy, announced Nov. 4, covers businesses with 100 or more employees. Under it, the businesses must implement and enforce a mandatory COVID-19 vaccination policy, unless they adopt a policy requiring employees to choose to either be vaccinated or undergo regular COVID-19 testing and wear a mask, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.
Workers would have to have their final vaccine dose by Jan. 4, according to Biden's administration. The nation's unvaccinated workers face grave danger from workplace exposure to coronavirus, and immediate action is necessary to protect them, the labor department said in a statement last week.
""We must take action to implement this emergency temporary standard to contain the virus and protect people in the workplace against the grave danger of COVID-19,"" U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh said on Nov. 4.
""Many businesses understand the benefits of having their workers vaccinated against COVID-19, and we expect many will be pleased to see this OSHA rule go into effect.""
In addition to filing the brief on Wednesday, the Michigan Senate approved a resolution that labeled the federal policy ""an egregious overreach"" that infringes on Americans' civil liberties. The proposal passed in a party-line, 20-15 vote.
In a speech on the Senate floor, Shirkey said the new federal requirements would unfairly put businesses in a ""bind.""
""The federal government getting further into their underwear is unnecessary, unwarranted, unproductive and indefensible,"" Shirkey said.
Sen. Erika Geiss, D-Taylor, said it was ""amazing"" that the resolution was what the Senate was prioritizing on Wednesday with billions of dollars in federal COVID-19 relief money still not allocated by lawmakers.
""Apparently, this body can't resist another opportunity to play politics with a pointless resolution that accomplishes nothing,"" Geiss said.
As of Tuesday, 69.8% of Michigan's population age 16 and up had received at least their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine, according to the state health department. The statistic means 2.4 million Michiganians age 16 and up still haven't been vaccinated.
Michigan's COVID-19 case rates and hospitalization numbers linked to the virus have been trending upward for months. The percentage of COVID-19 tests bringing positive results hit 13.7% last week, the highest weekly percentage since April 11-17, according to state health department data.
In the new court filing, the Legislature contended the U.S. Constitution reserves the general police power to the state, and that power encompasses public health. For that reason, the filing argued, states ""have long understood that OSHA's federal intrusion into a field traditionally occupied by the states was limited to occupational health and safety hazards.""
The vaccine policy ""obliterates that common understanding, trying to regulate activities outside the occupational setting that touch on citizens' daily lives,"" the filing said.

The third segment is Investments. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, Cannabis was the only reportable segment, and therefore no comparative segment information is available for the Investment or retail segments.Asset value per share at September 30, 2021, including cash, loans, marketable securities and the Olds facility at net book value was approximately $1.4 billion or $0.70 per share (US$1.1 billion or US$0.55 per share).

ALCANNA ACQUISITION 
On October 7, 2021, the Company announced that it had entered into an arrangement agreement with Alcanna pursuant to which the Company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Alcanna by way of a statutory plan of arrangement for total consideration of 387.3 million common shares of Sundial, with a value of approximately $346 million (the ""Alcanna Acquisition""). The Alcanna Acquisition is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2021, subject to customary closing conditions. Alcanna's longstanding liquor business provides Sundial with stable cash generation through a mature and proven business model with trailing twelve months free cash flow of $16.4 million on a built-out retail platform.
Alcanna is a Canadian liquor retailer, operating predominantly in Alberta under its three retail brands, ""Wine and Beyond"", ""Liquor Depot"" and ""Ace Liquor"". Alcanna also holds an approximate 63% equity interest in Nova Cannabis Inc., a Canadian cannabis retailer operating stores across Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Ontario.
THIRD QUARTER 2021 RESULTS 
CANNABIS RESULTS
The Company's Cannabis operations are comprised of two segments: cannabis cultivation and production and, with the acquisition of Inner Spirit, cannabis retail.
CANNABIS CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION 
Sundial remains focused and committed to optimization of its cultivation and processing activities. Sundial's ongoing investments in innovation and cultivation practices generated continued crop yield stability in the third quarter of 2021 with results at 51 grams per square foot versus 49 grams per square foot in third quarter of 2020. Sundial continues to achieve higher weighted average THC potency reaching its highest percentage results in the third quarter of 2021, validating the Company's efforts and improvements in cultivation. Sundial launched its newest product innovation, Caviar Cones, in the third quarter of 2021 under the award-winning Top Leaf brand. This launch, the first of its kind in Canada, reinforces Sundial's focused innovation pipeline of premium inhalables in the Canadian cannabis market. In the first four weeks after launch, the Top Leaf Forbidden Lemon Caviar Cone was the top-selling Pre-Roll SKU in all Spiritleaf stores in Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba (initial launch provinces).   Sundial's premium portfolio remains well positioned to focus on the higher margin inhalables segment.  The Company grew share of premium flower despite a purposeful portfolio rationalization reducing its assortment by almost 80% and focusing on higher potency and quality flower in the third quarter of 2021 under Top Leaf.GROSS MARGIN BEFORE FAIR VALUE ADJUSTMENTS Gross margin before fair value adjustments from cannabis cultivation and production for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was negative $4.9 million compared to negative $17.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The increase of $12.4 million was due to a lower inventory obsolescence provision compared to the prior period as well as Sundial's ongoing focus on cost optimization, reduction of harvest inventory subject to impairment and offering the most competitive and profitable strains and brands to its customers against the backdrop of industry-wide price compression and high relative operating costs at our premium facility.
NET REVENUE FROM CULTIVATION AND PRODUCTION Net revenue from cultivation and production operations in the third quarter of 2021 was $8.2 million compared to $12.9 million in the third quarter of 2020, reflecting the Company's continuing shift to branded sales from wholesales.
GROSS SELLING PRICE Average gross selling price was $3.23 per gram in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $2.67 per gram in the third quarter of 2020. The increase of $0.56 per gram equivalent was mainly due to an increase in prices for sales to other LPs, partially offset by lower prices for provincial board sales. Average gross selling price per gram equivalent of branded products, net of provisions, was $3.31 per gram in the third quarter of 2021, compared to $3.19 per gram in the second quarter of 2021. 
REVENUE BY FORMATS In the third quarter of 2021 gross revenue from Sundial's formats was:Three months ended

Gross revenue11,02215,52535,50956,456As the cannabis industry continues to be faced by challenges and price compression in all segments, Sundial's revenue by formats for the third quarter of 2021 has declined compared to the third quarter of 2020. Due to a purposeful portfolio rationalization in Sundial's vape segment along with continued price pressure, Sundial has seen a decrease in gross revenue in the third quarter of 2021.
CANNABIS RETAIL
Sundial completed its acquisition of Inner Spirit on July 20, 2021. As a result, this is the first quarter that the Company's consolidated financial results include Inner Spirit. Gross revenue for the period from July 20, 2021, to September 30, 2021, was $6.1 million. Cannabis retail revenue is comprised $3.9 million of retail cannabis sales to consumers at corporate-owned Spiritleaf retail cannabis stores and $2.2 million of franchise revenue, which represents royalty revenue, advertising revenue and franchise fees. System-wide retail sales1 were $33.5 million from July 20, 2021 to September 30, 2021and $47.1 million for the full third quarter, a record for the Spiritleaf retail network, generating approximately $2.2 million of franchise royalty and fee income for Sundial. System-wide retail sales represent the aggregate revenue earned by franchised Spiritleaf retail cannabis stores and corporate-owned Spiritleaf retail cannabis stores, and do not represent revenues that accrue to the Company. The Company receives all revenues from corporate-owned Spiritleaf retail cannabis stores, as well as royalties and advertising fees in respect of the franchised Spiritleaf retail cannabis store revenue forming part of the system-wide retail sales. A total of 14 Spiritleaf stores have been opened since July 2021. As of November 9, 2021, the store count is at 109. As Sundial further develops and optimizes its store network in Canada, the Company has launched a multi-store pilot program to improve the consumer experience through assortment, price and engagement to meet the diverse needs of Canadian cannabis consumers. Sundial implemented a Spiritleaf Franchisee Advisory Council to further engage Spiritleaf franchisees and to obtain feedback and collaboration on strategic initiatives to drive the continued growth and success of the Spiritleaf banner. __________

850,"Picked-up pieces while wondering whether Celtics players have chartered a jet so they can fly to Milwaukee to cheer for Kyrie in the next round . . . ■ Boston super cop Ed Davis is no longer cracking the case on the two-year-old shooting of David Ortiz in the Dominican Republic. Ortiz hired Davis to get to the bottom of things, but the search proved futile, and according to Davis, the investigation is ongoing in the DR with more than a dozen suspects still in custody.“I'm just a security guy here, so I don't want to go off on a tangent,"" Davis said Thursday. “The bottom line on it is this: This is a very complicated and still-dangerous situation that we're looking at. We provided the government down there with important information and there's still no resolution.“The case is still going on. There's a lot of people involved in this that are very powerful down there. It's just a long-term thing and I can't get into the details. I have a responsibility to my client.""Is Ortiz still Davis's client?“He was my client,"" said Davis. “He's no longer my client. I'm not doing anything right now until the political situation and the trial situation changes in the Dominican.""What is Davis's response to the local government's conclusion that the shooting of Ortiz was a case of mistaken identity?“I've already gone further than I'm supposed to go, so I'll leave it at that,"" said Davis. “I'm inactive with this now. I'm no longer on the case.""■ I had this exchange with Danny Ainge on May 14:Me: Are you coming back?Ainge: Of course.Me: Is [Brad] Stevens coming back?Ainge: Of course.After resigning this past Wednesday, Ainge told the Globe's Adam Himmelsbach that in late March he approached Celtics ownership and told them he did not think he had the energy to continue on the job.So, which is it? Did Ainge know he was leaving back in March, or was this a sudden departure after things fell apart in the first round of the playoffs?I checked in with Ainge to ask about the timeline discrepancy.“That was a tough moment when you and I talked,"" said Ainge. “It was so sensitive and so raw. That's why Wednesday was a relief. I've been holding on to so much information. From my kids, my players. Nobody knew any of this was happening.“It was really in a fragile state, and I didn't want any of this to be a distraction. I was totally trying to hold that topic off until a later time.“There was speculation that 'Danny was going to be fired' and 'Brad was going to be fired.' I wanted to say, 'Please don't write anything,' but my experience with you is that that was not going to work. It was just real sensitive. More than protecting myself, I was protecting everyone in the organization.“I apologize to you. I can't remember doing that before, and I hope I don't have to do it again. I just felt like I couldn't be forthright at that moment in time.""■ Quiz: Name the six players in baseball history with more than 500 homers who never struck out 100 times in a season. Answer below.■ It's hard to know where to start with the Naomi Osaka controversy at the French Open. A star tennis player is, above all, a human being. Osaka's disclosure that she has mental-health issues supersedes everything else. We wish her the best and applaud her bravery for shining a light on an important issue.Osaka deserves compassion, privacy, and respect. That said, her withdrawal from the major was global news and raises many issues:1. Much as we sympathize with the athlete, this is the life she chose. If you are going to be a big player on the tour, media obligations come with the territory. They promote the sport (ask Billie Jean King what would have happened if female players didn't participate in press conferences in the 1970s).2. Osaka made approximately $34 million from endorsement deals in 2020. Trading on fame to sell products generally requires some discourse with the public and the media. If top players in any sport are allowed to avoid media obligations, they should expect diminished coverage and dollars that come from the spotlight. Walling yourself off from the world makes you less interesting and less marketable.3. The French Tennis Federation reacted harshly, but only after Osaka ignored requests to talk with them about the issue.4. Osaka did a disservice to Romanian Patricia Tig, the player she beat in the first round. If you're going to take a stand and withdraw, do it before you send another player home. Tour players are on the hook for their own expenses, and Tig deserved to compete against a player who planned to stay in the draw.5. Too many media members are quick to join the “get rid of these stupid press conferences"" narrative. Those “stupid"" press conferences are important to the sport and media outlets that are unable to score one-on-ones with top players.■ Baseball's “spin rate"" moundsmen are on notice. This would be a bad time to get caught using illegal substances to grip the baseball.■ Absolutely incredible that the Red Sox did not play the Yankees until June 4. The Sox went to Yankee Stadium this weekend with a 6-23 record against the Bombers over the last two seasons.■ Intent on booing the Astros when they come to Fenway Tuesday? Try to remember that your Red Sox were punished for cheating in 2017 and 2018. Oh, and your manager is Alex Cora.■ Since Bill Belichick was hired to coach the Patriots, the Red Sox have had eight managers: Jimy Williams, Joe Kerrigan, Grady Little, Terry Francona, Bobby Valentine, John Farrell, Cora, and Ron Roenicke. The Celtics have had Rick Pitino, Jim O'Brien, John Carroll, Doc Rivers, Stevens, and a coach-to-be-named. The Bruins have had Pat Burns, Mike Keenan, Robbie Ftorek, Mike O'Connell, Mike Sullivan, Dave Lewis, Claude Julien, and Bruce Cassidy. That's 22 coaches while Belichick has steered the ship in Foxborough.■ I am told that the extended playing of “Sweet Caroline"" led to the ejection of Rochester manager Matt LeCroy Tuesday at Polar Park in Worcester when a Rochester relief pitcher was charged with an automatic “ball one"" because he was waiting for the PA and fans to cease with the annoying Neil Diamond tune before the home half of the eighth.■ Boston fans are Milwaukee Bucks fans in this second round of the NBA playoffs. Is there a single Celtics fan who is rooting for the Nets to beat the Bucks to get to the conference finals?■ With the season over for both teams, the Celtics and Lakers remain tied with 17 NBA championship banners.■ According to the Wall Street Journal, Kyle Lowry, Andre Iguodala, Andre Drummond, and Jrue Holiday are among more than 150 Black and Latino professionals helping to fund a $1 billion Harvard University real estate development in Allston.■ Now that sports leagues are in business with gamblers, they should be working on rules and guidelines regarding injury information. Phillies manager Joe Girardi brought this topic to the fore, telling reporters, “We're going to approach this different . . . I'm not going to share anything — who's available, who's not available — because I think it's somewhat unfair to us.""■ The Red Sox clubhouse resistance to COVID-19 vaccination is an underplayed story. J.D. Martinez would not answer when asked if he'd been vaccinated and the Sox continue to live with restrictions (masks, quarantines, inability to go out to dinner on the road, etc.) because they can't reach the 85 percent threshold of player vaccinations.Two-thirds of big league teams have cleared the bar, but the Sox are lagging, and no one seems confident that they will reach the 85 percent level.“That worries me a little,"" acknowledged Cora.■ Quiz answer: Mel Ott, Babe Ruth, Ted Williams, Hank Aaron, Albert Pujols, Gary Sheffield.Dan Shaughnessy is a Globe columnist.

851,"(TNSRep) -- The Congressional Research Service issued the following report (No. RS20643) updated on April 28, 2022, entitled ""Navy Ford Class Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues for Congress"":* * *(Continued from Part 2 of 2)Cost Growth and Managing Costs within Program Cost CapsOverviewAnother issue for Congress concerns cost growth in the CVN-78 program, which the Navy has worked for years to control. Navy efforts to stem cost growth and manage costs in the CVN-78 program so as to stay within the program's cost caps have been a continuing oversight issue for Congress several years. Congress in recent years has passed legislation on the issue that is in addition to the earlier-mentioned legislation that established and amended cost caps for the ships./50As shown in Table 2, the estimated procurement costs of CVN-78, CVN-79, and CVN-80 have grown 27.0%, 38.2%, and 19.7%, respectively, since the submission of the FY2008 budget. As shown in Table 1, cost growth on CVN-78 and CVN-79 has required the Navy to request or program $2,843.2 million (i.e., about $2.8 billion) in cost-to-complete (CC) procurement funding to cover cost growth on the two ships, including $1,465.9 million for CVN-78 and $1,377.3 million for CVN-79.CVN-78A primary source of past cost growth for CVN-78 appears to have been an unrealistically low original cost estimate for the ship in the FY2008 budget submission, which might have reflected an underestimate of the intrinsic challenges of building the then-new Ford-class design compared to those of building the previous and well understood Nimitz-class design./51In addition to this general cause of past cost growth, secondary and more-specific past risks of cost growth for CVN-78 included certain new systems to be installed on the ship. These included a new type of aircraft catapult called the Electromagnetic Launch System (EMALS), a new aircraft arresting system called the Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG), and the ship's primary radar, called the Dual Band Radar (DBR). Congress followed these and other sources of risk of cost growth on CVN-78 for years.CVNs 79, 80, and 81Impact of Original CVN-78 Cost EstimateAn unrealistically low cost estimate for CVN-78 may have led to similarly unrealistically low cost estimates for CVN-79 and CVN-80 in the FY2008 budget submission, since the cost estimates for CVN-79 and CVN-80 would have been derived from the estimate for CVN-78.* * *50 This additional legislation includes the following:Section 128 of the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1356/P.L. 114-92 of November 25, 2015), which established a limitation on availability of funds for CVN-79 until certain conditions were met; Section 126 of the FY2017 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 2943/P.L. 114-328 of December 23, 2016), which established a limitation on availability of funds for procurement of CVN-80 until certain conditions were met; Section 121(b) of the FY2018 National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 2810/P.L. 115-91 of December 12, 2017), which provided for a waiver on the limitation of availability of funds for CVN-79; and Section 122 of the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (S. 1790/P.L. 116-92 of December 20, 2020), which modified the above-listed Section 126 of P.L. 114-328 regarding an annual report on cost targets for CVN-78 class carriers.51 The Congressional Budget office (CBO) in 2008 and GAO in 2007 questioned the accuracy of the Navy's cost estimate for CVN-78. CBO reported in June 2008 that it estimated that CVN-78 would cost $11.2 billion in constant FY2009 dollars, or about $900 million more than the Navy's estimate of $10.3 billion in constant FY2009 dollars, and that if ""CVN-78 experienced cost growth similar to that of other lead ships that the Navy has purchased in the past 10 years, costs could be much higher still."" CBO also reported that, although the Navy publicly expressed confidence in its cost estimate for CVN-78, the Navy had assigned a confidence level of less than 50% to its estimate, meaning that the Navy believed there was more than a 50% chance that the estimate would be exceeded. (Congressional Budget Office, Resource Implications of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2009 Shipbuilding Plan, June 9, 2008, p. 20.) GAO reported in August 2007 that 'Costs for CVN 78 will likely exceed the budget for several reasons. First, the Navy's cost estimate, which underpins the budget, is optimistic. For example, the Navy assumes that CVN 78 will be built with fewer labor hours than were needed for the previous two carriers. Second, the Navy's target cost for ship construction may not be achievable. The shipbuilder's initial cost estimate for construction was 22 percent higher than the Navy's cost target, which was based on the budget.'Although the Navy and the shipbuilder are working on ways to reduce costs, the actual costs to build the ship will likely increase above the Navy's target. Third, the Navy's ability to manage issues that affect cost suffers from insufficient cost surveillance. Without effective cost surveillance, the Navy will not be able to identify early signs of cost growth and take necessary corrective action.(Government Accountability Office, Defense Acquisitions[:] Navy Faces Challenges Constructing the Aircraft Carrier Gerald R. Ford within Budget, GAO-07-866, August 2007, summary page. See also Government Accountability Office, Defense Acquisitions[:] Realistic Business Cases Needed to Execute Navy Shipbuilding Programs, Statement of Paul L. Francis, Director, Acquisition and Sourcing Management Team, Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Seapower and Expeditionary Forces, Committee on Armed Services, House of Representatives, July 24, 2007 (GAO-07-943T), p. 15.)* * *Confidence LevelsThe Navy stated in June 2019 that its confidence levels for its estimated procurement costs (not including costs for class-wide spare parts) for CVNs 79, 80, and 81 were 36%, 22%, and 20%, respectively, meaning that the Navy as of June 2019 estimated that the risk of future cost growth on CVNs 79, 80, and 81 were 64%, 78%, and 80%, respectively./52* * *52 Source: Navy information paper provided to CRS by Navy Office of legislative Affairs on June 20, 2019.* * *October 2019 CBO ReportAn October 2019 CBO report on the potential cost of the Navy's FY2020 30-year shipbuilding plan states the following regarding the CVN-78 program:'The Navy's current estimate of the total cost of the USS Gerald R. Ford, the lead ship of the CVN-78 class, is $13.1 billion in nominal dollars appropriated over the period from 2001 to 2018. CBO used the Navy's inflation index for naval shipbuilding to convert that figure to $16.2 billion in 2019 dollars, or 25 percent more than the corresponding estimate when the ship was first authorized in 2008. Neither the Navy's nor CBO's estimate includes the $5 billion in research and development costs that apply to the entire class.'Because construction of the lead ship is finished, CBO used the Navy's estimate for that ship to estimate the cost of successive ships in the class. But not all of the cost risk has been eliminated; in particular, the ship's power systems, advanced arresting gear (the system used to recover fixed-wing aircraft landing on the ship), and weapons elevators are not yet working properly. It is not clear how much those problems will cost to fix, but current Navy estimates suggest that it will be several tens of millions of dollars or more.'CBO does not have enough information to independently estimate those final repair costs.'The next carrier after the CVN-78 is the CVN-79, the John F. Kennedy, which is expected to be completed in 2024 and deployed in 2026. Funding for the ship began in 2007, the Congress officially authorized its construction in 2013, and the planned appropriations for it were completed in 2018. The Navy estimates that the ship will cost $11.3 billion in nominal dollars (or $11.9 billion in 2019 dollars). The Navy's 2014 selected acquisition report on the CVN-79 states that ""the Navy and shipbuilder have made fundamental changes in the manner in which the CVN 79 will be built to incorporate lessons learned from CVN 78 and eliminate the key contributors to cost performance challenges realized in the construction of CVN 78."" Nevertheless, the Navy informed CBO that there is a greater than 60 percent chance that the ship's final cost will be more than the current estimate. Although CBO expects the Navy to achieve a considerable cost reduction in the CVN-79 compared with the CVN-78, as is typical with the second ship of a class, CBO's estimate is higher than the Navy's. Specifically, CBO estimates that the ship will cost $12.4 billion in nominal dollars (or $12.9 billion in 2019 dollars), about 9 percent more than the Navy's estimate.'In 2018, the Congress authorized the third carrier of the class, the Enterprise (CVN-80).'Appropriations for that ship began in 2016 and are expected to be complete by 2025. In 2019, the Congress authorized the Navy to purchase materials jointly for the CVN-80 and the next ship, the CVN-81, to save money by buying in greater quantity. It also authorized the Navy to change the sequencing involved in building the ships to gain greater efficiencies in their construction. Although that legislative action is known as a ""twocarrier buy,"" the Navy would not be building both ships at exactly the same time.'Purchasing the two ships together would accelerate the CVN-81's construction by only one year compared with buying the ships individually as envisioned in the 2019 shipbuilding plan.'In the 2020 budget, the Navy estimated that the CVN-80 would cost $12.3 billion in nominal dollars (or $11.4 billion in 2019 dollars). That represents a savings of $300 million compared with the Navy's estimate in the 2019 budget. In contrast, CBO estimates that the CVN-80 would cost $13.6 billion in nominal dollars (or $12.4 billion in 2019 dollars), about 9 percent more than the Navy's estimate. In information provided to CBO as part of the 2019 budget presentation, the Navy indicated that there was a greater than 60 percent chance that the ship's final cost will be more than it estimated; in contrast, with the 2020 budget, the Navy puts that figure at 78 percent. Thus, it is not clear whether the service's 2020 estimates incorporate savings stemming from a two-carrier buy or simply an acceptance of increased risk of future cost growth.'With respect to the CVN-81, the pattern is similar. In the 2019 budget, the Navy estimated the CVN-81 at $15.1 billion in nominal dollars. In the 2020 budget with the two-carrier buy, the Navy estimated the cost of the ship at $12.6 billion in nominal dollars (or $10.5 billion in 2019 dollars), for a savings of $2.5 billion. However, the Navy also told CBO that there is an 80 percent chance that the final cost will be higher than the current estimate, compared with the roughly 40 percent chance indicated in the 2019 budget. CBO estimates that the CVN-81 would cost $14.4 billion in nominal dollars (or $11.9 billion in 2019 dollars), or 14 percent more than the Navy's estimate.'Overall, the Navy estimates an average cost of $12.7 billion (in 2019 dollars) for the 7 carriers (CVN-81 through CVN-87) in the 2020 shipbuilding plan. CBO's estimate is $13.0 billion per ship ... '/53CVN-79Navy officials have stated that they are working to control the cost of CVN-79 by equipping the ship with a less expensive primary radar,/54 by turning down opportunities to add features to the ship that would have made the ship more capable than CVN-78 but would also have increased CVN-79's cost, and by using a build strategy for the ship that incorporates improvements over the build strategy that was used for CVN-78. These build-strategy improvements, Navy officials have said, include the following items, among others:* achieving a higher percentage of outfitting of ship modules before modules are stacked together to form the ship;* achieving ""learning inside the ship,"" which means producing similar-looking ship modules in an assembly line-like series, so as to achieve improved production learning curve benefits in the production of these modules; and* more economical ordering of parts and materials including greater use of batch ordering of parts and materials, as opposed to ordering parts and materials on an individual basis as each is needed.* * *53 Congressional Budget Office, An Analysis of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2020 Shipbuilding Plan, October 2019, pp. 17-19.54 See, for example, Megan Eckstein, ""PEO Carriers: CVN-79 Will Have a New Radar, Save $180M Compared to [CVN-78's] Dual Band Radar,"" USNI News, March 17, 2015; Christopher P.

Ford class of carriers, a company official said.'Brian Fields, the vice president of aircraft carrier construction for CVN-80 and CVN-81, told reporters Feb. 18 the company had a plan going into construction on the Gerald R. Ford, but lessons learned are driving down cost and schedule as the company works through the John F. Kennedy and now the Enterprise.'One lesson relates to crane lifts of large modules or supermodules. Given the immense size of aircraft carriers, the workforce builds the steel framing for segments of the ship, which can then be outfitted with pipes and cables. These modules are then lifted by crane and put into place on the hull.'Fields said the company has learned to use even larger supermodules, therefore needing fewer crane lifts to put the pieces into place.'""Some of our super lifts [on Enterprise] have incorporated what on [Ford and Kennedy] were in some cases 10, 15 erections with a crane -- building one large supermodule,"" he said. ""We're seeing a lot more opportunity to outfit earlier in the build process, which provides a lot of efficiencies just based on where the work is being performed."" Fields said the company is also trying to group steel structures into ""unit families,"" where the pieces aren't identical but similar enough that lessons can still be applied from one piece to the next. The sequencing on Ford and Kennedy had been based on what steel pieces were needed in what order to form modules that could be stacked in the right order.'The new changes on Enterprise mean some steel pieces are built early to need - but Fields said ""localized learning"" could happen when similar pieces were built consecutively in a ""batch manufacturing process.""'Fields said the company is seeing similar learning happening at its 2,500 suppliers around the country....'Fields also noted the Ford class was designed in a digital 3D environment, rather than using traditional blueprint drawings. The associated step-by-step digital work instructions weren't ready for the first two ships, so Ford and Kennedy were built by craftspeople using paper drawings derived from the digital plans - though Kennedy was used to experiment with early digital work instructions and get employee feedback.'Starting with Enterprise, workers at the shipyard used laptops with digital work instructions for each step, with 3D images that can be enlarged and rotated.'""It provides the mechanics a lot clearer picture of what they're expected to be doing. It helps with first-time quality. It helps the younger craftspeople, who sometimes, we find it takes as much time to learn to read drawings as it does to develop the craft skills,"" Fields said.'Enterprise and Doris Miller will be fully built with these digital work instructions, in a first for the Navy.'Fields said the Navy invested significantly in getting the 3D product model and the digital work instructions right, as they will be the basis of not only construction of carriers and submarines at Newport News but also for lifecycle maintenance work at the Navy's four public shipyards.'Fields said Newport News Shipbuilding made a ""generational investment"" in buying laptops for all hourly workers so they could access the digital work instructions. But, he said, the investment is yielding other benefits, giving workers immediate access to resources like procedures, troubleshooting manuals and more, as well as better access to their supervisors.'/55* * *55 Megan Eckstein, ""Navy Says Digital Work Instructions, Lessons Learned Are Improving Construction of Third Ford-Class Carrier,"" Defense News, March 7, 2022.* * *Issues Raised in DOT&E and GAO ReportsAnother oversight issue for Congress concerns CVN-78 program issues raised in a January 2022 report from DOD's Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) - DOT&E's annual report for FY2021 - and in the 2021 edition of the Government Accountability Office's (GAO's) annual report surveying selected DOD weapon acquisition programs, which was published in June 2021.January 2022 DOT&E ReportRegarding the CVN-78 program, the January 2022 DOT&E report stated the following in part: Test AdequacyIn December 2020, the Navy concluded the Self Defense Test Ship phase of CVN 78 ICS [Integrated Combat System] operational test by conducting a test against supersonic ASCM [anti-ship cruise missile] surrogates. The Navy completed three of the four planned SelfDefense Test Ship tests in the DOT&E-approved test plan, and those that were completed deviated from the approved test plan. Testing was not adequate to assess the combat system's capability against supersonic ASCMs and subsonic maneuvering ASCMs, and there are no future test events planned that could provide additional data against these threats. DOT&E will issue an interim assessment of CVN 78 self-defense capabilities in FY22.Only a limited assessment of CVN 78 combat system effectiveness is possible. The 2008 DOT&E approved Enterprise TEMP [Test and Evaluation Master Plan] called for the use of DDG 1000 [Zumwalt-class destroyer]/56 combat system performance data to supplement the evaluation of the CVN 78 combat system; however, the redesigned DDG 1000 system differs significantly from the CVN 78 system. The Navy did not supplement the CVN 78 test campaign to compensate for the 10 test events it originally expected to leverage from DDG 1000 testing.The Navy tested the combat system aboard CVN 78 during Combat Systems Ship's Qualification Trials (CSSQT) and combat systems operational rehearsal events. This testing was not covered by a DOT&E approved test plan.From June to August 2021, the Navy completed FSST [Full-Ship Shock Trial] to assess CVN 78's combat shock survivability. The trial was adequate to evaluate the ship's operational survivability after exposure to an underwater threat induced shock. The trial consisted of a series of three nearby underwater explosions of increasing severity up to two-thirds of the design level requirement/specification. The ship was manned and operational during each shot. Testing included a demonstration of the ship's ability to continue its primary missions after shock. Where shock hardened ship systems and equipment could not continue operating after shock, trial cards were written to identify shock deficiencies for correction. In accordance with the approved trial plan, the ship was not outfitted with live ordnance or an air wing, and most JP-5 aviation fuel was removed.The Navy expects to begin IOT&E [Initial Operational Test and Evaluation] in 2QFY23 [the second quarter of FY2023], following planned incremental availability at Newport News Shipyard. The Navy is planning to conduct IOT&E in accordance with draft TEMP Revision E and DOT&E reports to Congress dated November 30, 2018 and November 26, 2019, but the TEMP Revision E and required test plans have not yet been submitted for approval by DOT&E.While the Navy has proposed several strategies to test the cyber survivability of CVN 78, none of these strategies have been finalized, adequately resourced, or formally approved by DOT&E.* * *56 For more on-the DDG-1000 class, see CRS Report RL32109, Navy DDG-51 and DDG-1000 Destroyer Programs: Background and Issues for Congress, by Ronald O'Rourke.* * *PerformanceEffectivenessCombat SystemIn accordance with the CVN-78 Security Classification Guide, the effectiveness of the combat system is detailed in the Controlled Unclassified Information edition of this report. The report details the capability of the combat system to detect, track, engage, and defeat the types of threats for which the system was designed.Sortie Generation Rate (SGR)CVN 78 is unlikely to achieve its SGR requirement. The target SGR threshold is well above achieved historical rates and based on unrealistic assumptions, including fair weather and unlimited visibility, along with the expectation that aircraft emergencies, failures of shipboard equipment, ship maneuvers, and manning shortfalls will not negatively affect flight operations. Poor reliability of key systems that support sortie generation on CVN 78 could cause a cascading series of delays during flight operations that would likely negatively affect CVN 78's ability to generate sorties. The reliability of these critical subsystems represents the most risk to the successful completion of CVN 78 IOT&E.Electromagnetic Spectrum CompatibilityDevelopmental testing identified significant electromagnetic radiation hazard and interference problems. The Navy implemented some mitigation measures and conducted follow-on characterization testing during Independent Steaming Events (ISEs) in developmental test, but some operational limitations and restrictions are expected to persist into IOT&E and deployment. The Navy will need to develop capability assessments at differing levels of system use to inform decisions on system employment.SuitabilityReliabilityThe low reliability of the following four new CVN 78 systems stand out as the most significant challenges expected to affect the ship's flight operations:Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS)During the 8,157 catapult launches conducted through ISE 18, EMALS achieved a reliability of 272 mean cycles between operational mission failures (MCBOMF), where a cycle is the launch of one aircraft. This reliability is well below the requirement of 4,166 MCBOMF. The reliability concerns are amplified by the fact that the crew cannot readily electrically isolate EMALS components during flight operations because of the shared nature of the Energy Storage Groups and Power Conversion Subsystem inverters on board CVN 78. The process for electrically isolating equipment is time-consuming. Spinning down the EMALS motor and generators alone is a 1.5-hour process, precluding some EMALS maintenance during flight operations.Advanced Arresting Gear (AAG)During 8,157 recoveries, AAG achieved a reliability of 41 MCBOMF, where a cycle is the recovery of a single aircraft. This reliability estimate falls well below the requirement of 16,500 MCBOMF.The reliability concerns are amplified by the AAG's design, which does not allow the Power Conditioning Subsystem equipment to be electrically isolated from high power buses, limiting corrective maintenance on below-deck equipment during flight operations.Advanced Weapons Elevators (AWE)While all 11 AWEs have been installed, only 8 of the 11 have been formally delivered to the Navy. The other three are installed, but are still the responsibility of the manufacturer.Therefore, only preliminary reliability estimates are available to compare to the requirement of 932 hours between operational mission failure. Through the first 14,842 elevator cycles, 68 operational mission failures were reported. AWE system reliability will be critical as the Navy completes delivery of the remaining three elevators and develops standard procedures for moving ordnance from magazines to the flight deck.Dual Band Radar (DBR)Through ISE 18, DBR demonstrated a reliability of 102 hours mean time between operational mission failures. This is below the requirement of 339 hours. However, DBR was operationally available 96 percent of the time, close to the 98 percent requirement.SurvivabilityWhile shock trial data analysis is ongoing, the Navy has already identified several survivability improvement opportunities for the CVN 78 class against underwater threat engagements. Details will be provided in an interim, classified CVN 78 FSST report expected to be published 2QFY22 after all data and observations have been adequately reviewed and analyzed.The survivability of CVN 78 in a cyber-contested environment has not yet been evaluated.Many subsystems on the ship were tested to various degrees in both developmental testing and operational testing on other ship platforms. However, required CVN 78 platform-level testing has not yet occurred, and some systems specific to CVN 78 have yet to undergo any operational cyber survivability assessments. These assessments will need to be conducted as part of CVN 78 IOT&E.The survivability of CVN 78 in a contested and congested electromagnetic spectrum environment has not yet been evaluated. Discussions on how to evaluate CVN 78 survivability in contested and congested electromagnetic spectrum environments are ongoing with the Navy.RecommendationsThe Navy should:1. Address combat system issues identified during CVN 78 ICS testing during CSSQT and on the SDTS.2. Fund the M&S suite required to assess the CVN 78 Probability of Raid Annihilation requirement for subsonic targets.3. Implement the recommendation contained in DOT&E's FY20 report to complete Self-Defense Test Ship test events.4. Continue to improve availability and reliability for EMALS, AAG, DBR, and AWE.5. Implement major fixes to CIWS hardware and software to improve the system's reliability and operational availability.6. Continue to characterize the electromagnetic spectrum environment on board CVN 78 and develop operating procedures to maximize system effectiveness and maintain safety. As applicable, the Navy should use the lessons learned from CVN 78 to modify the design of CVN 79 and future carriers.7. Implement design changes to address survivability issues identified during the FSST.8. Complete validation of the M&S [modeling and simulation] tools supporting the LFT&E [Live Fire Test & Evaluation] assessment, including comparing the FSST data to relevant M&S predictions.9. Continue to fund the maintenance availability for the current SDTS [Self-Defense Test Ship] (e.g., Paul F. Foster) to ensure its readiness to support CVN 79 combat system testing.10. Continue to fund the procurement and installation of the necessary CVN 79 combat system elements on the Self-Defense Test Ship.11. Conduct a shore-based operational assessment of EASR [Enterprise Air Surveillance Radar]/57 at Wallops Island, Virginia. This testing should evaluate EASR's contributions to air traffic control and self-defense missions, as well as provide an early assessment of electromagnetic interference and radiation hazard concerns.12. Update the CVN 78 platform TEMP to include cybersecurity testing on CVN 78 and testing of the combat system on CVN 79 to assess the effectiveness and suitability of the new combat system with EASR./58* * *57 The use of the word Enterprise in the name of this radar is not a reference to the Navy's now-retired aircraft carrier Enterprise (CVN-65); it instead signals that the radar has potential applicability across a business area (i.e., enterprise), the enterprise in this case being Navy surface ships of various types.58 Department of Defense, Director, Operational Test & Evaluation, FY2021 Annual Report, January 2022, pp. 143-145.* * *A January 25, 2022, press report about the DOT&E report stated'The combat system for the Navy's newest and costliest warship, the $13 billion Gerald R.

It said ""the Navy has already identified several survivability"" opportunities to improve the four-carrier class of ships ""against underwater threat engagements.""...'The report, which contains unclassified and ""controlled unclassified"" information and has been circulated to the Navy, found that ""only a limited assessment"" of the combat system's effectiveness is possible at this point.

For example, as of October 2020, the Navy had certified only six of the 11 elevators to operate on the ship. Further, according to Navy officials, while six elevators are currently operational--three Upper Stage, one utility elevator, and two Lower Stage--only the two Lower Stage elevators are capable of delivering munitions to the main deck. The Navy is working with the shipbuilder to complete the five remaining elevators - all Lower Stage units - by the spring of 2021. The Navy plans to begin testing at a land-based site in early 2022 - following a one-year delay due to contract issues - to assess the elevators' performance and reliability. With units already operating on CVN 78, any changes to the elevators resulting from land-based testing are likely to be costly and time-consuming for the Ford-class program.The Navy also continues to struggle with achieving the reliability of the electromagnetic aircraft launch system (EMALS) and Arresting Gear (AAG) in support of its requirement to rapidly deploy aircraft. The Navy is conducting shipboard testing as it prepares for operational testing to begin in the summer of 2022. However, if these systems do not reliably function during this test phase, CVN 78 may not be able to demonstrate it can rapidly deploy aircraft. The Navy also does not expect EMALS and AAG to demonstrate their required reliability until after CVN 78 has begun deploying to the fleet.Since 2013, we have identified concerns with the Ford Class test schedule, which have been borne out as the start of operational testing has now been delayed by over 5 years to a planned date of August 2022. Most recently, program officials confirmed that the lead ship (CVN 78) will reach initial capability in July 2021--4 months later than they reported last year--to align with the completion of post-delivery testing. The Navy will declare initial capability without demonstrating capability or performance through successful operational testing, missing an opportunity to determine whether the ship is capable of conducting mission operations. The Navy plans to complete operational testing in November 2023.Further, the 2013 test and evaluation master plan is no longer current and program officials told us they anticipate sending the revised plan for Navy leadership review in early 2021.Without an approved test plan, we cannot comment on the Navy's test events and whether current areas of technical risk inform the plan. We found past test plans to be optimistic, with little margin for delays. Program officials stated that test plan revisions are not delaying any required testing.Software and CybersecuritySeparate program offices manage software development for CVN 78's critical technologies. The CVN 78 program is scheduled to complete an evaluation for potential cybersecurity vulnerabilities connected with section 1647 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 in May 2022.Other Program IssuesThe lead ship (CVN 78) cost cap is currently $13.2 billion, more than $2.7 billion higher than its initial cap. Program officials do not believe they will need additional funding to correct deficiencies found in CVN 78's acceptance trials. However, until CVN 78's testing is completed, the risk of discovering more costly deficiencies persists.The Navy is unlikely to obtain planned cost savings on CVN 79 due to several factors. CVN 79 is 74 percent complete, but as of June 2020, ship construction is lagging behind cost saving goals. Further, according to program officials, the shipbuilder's COVID-19 pandemic mitigations also reduced construction efficiency. Officials also explained that the Navy is making additional changes for CVN 79, including integrating F-35 aircraft and adjusting to a new single-phase delivery schedule, but has yet to assess how these factors will affect cost and schedule. The Navy reported awarding fixed-price contracts for CVNs 80 and 81 in January 2019, which it expects to limit cost liability and incentivize shipbuilder performance. The Navy made optimistic assumptions that this two-ship contract will save over $4 billion. We previously reported that the Navy's own cost analysis showed that CVNs 80 and 81 have a high likelihood of cost overruns, which aligns with our findings on CVN 78 and CVN 79 cost growth.Program Office CommentsWe provided a draft of this assessment to the program office for review and comment. The program office provided technical comments, which we incorporated where appropriate. The program office stated that CVN 78 has completed 15 of 18 months of the ship's postdelivery test schedule. It added that during this time, CVN 78 recorded nearly 6,400 aircraft launches and recoveries. According to the program office, the ship completed carrier qualification for over 400 aviators and cleared 99 percent of discrepancies from its acceptance trials. The program office noted that CVN 78 broke records for number of aircraft landings in one day and for consecutive days at sea. Additionally, the program office stated that CVN 80 will start construction in February 2022. Lastly, the program office reported that COVID-19 continues to affect construction performance./60Legislative Activity for FY2023Summary of Congressional Action on FY2023 Funding RequestTable 3 summarizes congressional action on the FY2023 procurement funding request for the CVN-78 program.

853,"Jan. 19 - SPRINGFIELD  -  State officials on Wednesday expressed optimism that COVID-19 case numbers, and deaths, may now be on the decline.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Illinois Department of Public Health Director Dr. Ngozi Ezike expressed optimism in the recent COVID-19 trends in Illinois. At the same time, they stated that masks and vaccinations remain the most effective tools in the battle against the disease.
""I am cautiously optimistic about this decline,"" Pritzker said. ""But there are still an awful lot of people battling for their lives in hospitals throughout Illinois.
""Despite the recent indications of fewer new infections and fewer new hospital admissions ahead, it breaks my heart to know that in the coming weeks, hundreds more may die among the thousands who are already seriously ill,"" he said. ""Again, the vast majority of those are among the unvaccinated.""
The two said Wednesday was the 7th day since statewide COVID-19 hospitalizations peaked at 7,380 on Jan. 13. Since then, the state's single-day number of COVID patients has fallen by more than 870 patients.
The IDPH said Illinois on Wednesday had 26,491 COVID cases in the last 24 hours with a daily average of 26,640 per day. That is an 18.3% decrease from the peak hit on Jan. 12. Statewide 6,507 hospitalizations were recorded yesterday, an 11.8% decrease from the peak hit Jan. 13.
""The sheer volume, however, still is a problem,"" Ezike said. ""We still have to pull every single lever available to help increase just the staff to care for those people in the hospital.""
On Wednesday there were 121 COVID-19 patients in Madison County hospitals, 12 on ventilators.
No additional COVID-19 deaths were reported Wednesday in Madison, Macoupin, Jersey, Greene and Calhoun counties.
For January, the Madison County Health Department has reported 38 COVID-19 related deaths, with a total of 684 deaths to date.
The new figures came as the federal government announced it will begin making 400 million N95 masks available for free to Americans starting next week, available for pickup at pharmacies and community health centers across the country.
The White House on Wednesday said the masks will come from the government's Strategic National Stockpile, which has more than 750 million of the highly protective masks on hand. The masks will begin shipping this week for distribution starting late next week, the White House said.
On Tuesday the federal government announced every home can now receive four free at-home COVID-19 tests through the mail. The free tests are available at a new website, COVIDtests.gov. Orders will usually ship in 7-12 days and will include instructions on how to use them.
The MCHD on Wednesday reported 895 new confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases. Of those cases, 255 involved patients younger than 20. The MCHD on Wednesday reported 154 new cases in Alton and 103 in Granite City.
Unofficially, COVID-19 cases in the county now total about than 14,000 for January. According to the MCHD Wednesday, the total number of cases to date in the county is 62,164. The total number of tests to date is 688,878.
On Wednesday the three-day positivity rate for Madison County was 32.45 percent, the highest ever. The seven-day rate was 22.91 percent and the 10-day rate was 23.34 percent.
Ezike on Wednesday said the reported number of cases is no longer the most important statistic to track.
""I am absolutely moving away from the cases because we know that that's not even the full story, given all the home tests and all the positives that are happening at home that are not recorded in any of our Department of Public Health databases,"" she said. ""But the hospitalizations, you can't hide a hospitalization. And so as we look at those hospitalizations and understand where those numbers are going, ...that is definitely a clear signal of the direction we're moving in.""
Madison County has extended COVID-19 vaccinations to kids 5-11 years old at its office, 101 E. Edwardsville Road in Wood River. Vaccinations for all ages are by appointment only; people can visit www.madisonchd.org and click the green ""Appointments for Vaccines are Open"" button, or call 618-692-8954, Ext. 2.

856,"Apr. 6A revised law temporarily banning evictions in Pittsburgh was approved Tuesday by city council.
The law is also supported by Mayor Bill Peduto.
""I hope that we do see some level of enforcement,"" Councilwoman Deb Gross said.
Gross has worked with community activists and city officials to fine-tune the law, which is designed to protect people facing hardships caused by the coronavirus pandemic from being evicted from their homes.
But crafting a temporary ban on evictions that can be enforced and is able to withstand legal challenges has taken months. Council initially adopted the ban March 2.
Before it was signed into law by Peduto, a North Huntingdon-based group that represents landlords sued the city March 5 because the law surpasses the powers granted the city under state law.
City officials have worked with its legal team to revise the law's language to more clearly define who can be evicted and to reduce the penalties, from as much as $10,000 to $1,000 for a landlord who evicts an adult or up to $2,500 for a landlord who evicts a family with children under age 13.
Peduto supports the revisions and will sign the law, spokesman Tim McNulty said.
Council unanimously passed the revisions.
The moratorium ends when the city's covid-19 emergency status expires. The latest emergency declaration runs through April 13, but council has extended it regularly as the pandemic continues.
The city's Commission on Human Relations decides if landlords can receive an exemption from the law to evict tenants who are a health or safety issue. The commission added information about the moratorium on its website.
Landlords and tenants can also apply for federal rent and utility relief money that's being administered through a joint Pittsburgh/Allegheny County program that has $36 million in federal money to distribute to help people pay rent and utilities. It can also cover back rent owed to landlords.

",Pittsburgh council passes revised ban on evictions
858,"As the rate of people getting vaccinated has declined in recent weeks, so have public health officials' expectations. So when about 50 people were waiting for a pop-up coronavirus vaccine clinic at Warren Central High School to open Saturday morning, Marion County Public Health Department Director Dr. Virginia A. Caine took that as a good sign.
Two other high school pop-up clinics have drawn about 100 people each, so seeing half as many present before the six-hour clinic began augured an even better turnout.
Starting Saturday, however, people vaccinated at a health department clinic were eligible to win prizes, including Indianapolis Colts season tickets and a signed Peyton Manning jersey, Pacers half-season pass, Children's Museum tickets and more.
""I wonder if the incentives are making a difference,"" Caine mused, as she watched a steady stream of people enter the clinic. ""I think this is going to turn out to be a larger turnout.""
Another factor encouraging high school student participation could be coaches urging their athletes to be immunized, Caine said. Those who are not fully vaccinated and are exposed to an infected person will have to quarantine for 10 days, which could mean missed practices and games.
Still, Marion County and the rest of the state lag behind the nation as a whole when it comes to vaccination.
About 39% of the full Marion County population is vaccinated, Caine said, compared with just under 45% of the United States population. About 43% of the Marion County population has at least one shot, compared with 53% of the U.S. population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But Caine said she takes heart in two statistics — the county's positivity rate, now at 2.7% and the case rate. Last week the county saw about 39 new cases a day; next week, Caine predicted, that number will fall below 35 cases a day.
While fewer than 40% of the population has been fully vaccinated, Caine said she hopes that people continue to be immunized in the coming weeks. Two large local health care employers, Indiana University Health and Community Health Network, have mandated vaccination for their employees by the fall.
If you add in those who have may enjoy natural immunity from past COVID infections to those who have received the vaccine, Marion County may soon enjoy herd immunity, Caine said. But the estimated 30% who have natural immunity will need to be vaccinated in order to enjoy long-term immunity, she added, citing recent research that suggests such immunity may last as long as 10 months.
In an effort to encourage more people to get vaccinated, city officials are exploring other incentives they could offer that would lure people to vaccine clinics, she said.
For Warren senior Eric Eppes-Hampton the draw was simple: An upcoming family trip to New York, said his grandmother Barbara Eppes, who brought him to Saturday's clinic.
Everyone else in the family going on the trip has been vaccinated except Eric's mother and she was planning on trying to get vaccinated after work later in the day.
""I don't think he cared one way or another,"" Eppes said. ""This gave him a little more incentive.""
Robert Sargent was waiting for his wife, Beverly, to get the shot before he would. Robert had had COVID back in March and did not want to go through another bout.
But Beverly was vacillating on whether to get vaccinated because of her allergies. Their adult daughter in Washington has been urging them to get the shot.
Saturday found them at Warren Center, both getting the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine.
""I finally made up my mind to get one,"" Beverly said.
A Warren Central senior Sienna Fletcher has been remote schooling all year. Now that she and her sister have been vaccinated, said her mother, Jennifer Sovern, she will have peace of mind when they go back in person in the fall.
""It would just make me feel better if they had it,"" Sovern said.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures
To supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with GAAP and aid understanding of the Company's business performance, the Company uses certain non-GAAP financial measures, namely ""Adjusted EBITDA"" and ""Adjusted EBITDA Margin."" We believe Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin assist investors and analysts in comparing our operating performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that we do not believe are indicative of our core operating performance. 
Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in highlighting trends in our operating performance, while other measures can differ significantly depending on long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and capital investments. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to supplement GAAP measures of performance in the evaluation of the effectiveness of our business strategies, to make budgeting decisions, to establish discretionary annual incentive compensation and to compare our performance against that of other peer companies using similar measures. Management supplements GAAP results with non-GAAP financial measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the business than GAAP results alone.
Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are not recognized terms under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss) or the ratio of net income (loss) to net revenue as a measure of financial performance, cash flows provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity, or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP. Additionally, these measures are not intended to be a measure of cash available for management's discretionary use as they do not consider certain cash requirements such as interest payments, tax payments and debt service requirements. The presentations of these measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP. Because not all companies use identical calculations, the presentations of these measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies and can differ significantly from company to company. 
Please see ""Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below for reconciliations of non-GAAP financial measures used in this release to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.

860,"""First-time homebuyers in Nashville who were hoping to buy in one neighborhood may have to settle for a more affordable neighborhood... .""
Jeff Tucker, Zillow Senior Economist
First-time homebuyers in Nashville now need an estimated eight and a half years to save for a 20% down payment on a starter home, up from seven years in 2016, according to a Zillow report.The average Nashville renter would need to save 10% of their income over that period to pay 20% down on a home worth $227,995 — the median home in the bottom third of the Nashville area's home prices. (Nationwide, the average renter saves 2.4%.)
These estimates assume that home prices remain stagnant during that savings period, something that almost certainly will not happen, Zillow Senior Economist Jeff Tucker said.
""(The amount of time needed to save for a down payment) would presumably stretch out as prices rise further,"" he said.
Nationwide, rising home prices are outpacing growth in renter incomes, and Nashville is no exception. Zillow estimates home values will grow 14.9% nationwide over the next year. To keep up with rising costs, renters would need to save an additional $369 each month.
""This is really by many metrics the hottest we've ever seen the housing market in the U.S.,"" Tucker said. ""That absolutely means that for a renter trying to save up for a down payment, in some cases they may even be falling behind on a monthly basis, even while setting aside a substantial amount of savings.""
But 64% of first-time buyers put less than 20% down on their starter home, and 25% put down 5% or less. Most conventional mortgages can accept as little as 3% down, though these smaller down payments mean monthly mortgage payments will be higher and may include required private mortgage insurance. Thanks to current low mortgage rates, smaller down payments are still relatively affordable, according to Zillow.
The average Nashville renter would need to save 10% of their income for 4.3 years to put 10% down on that same starter home, or 2.1 years for a 5% down payment.
Attractive housing market means more competition for locals
Nashville housing is in short supply and high demand, causing prices to rise. But the cost of home ownership in Nashville is still inexpensive compared to prices elsewhere in the nation, drawing in new residents from other cities and states.
Michael Haywood purchased his home with his girlfriend in June 2020. Refunds from travel cancelled by COVID-19, savings from minimal living during lockdown and rent contributions from a roommate allowed them to amass a down payment. They found a home just on the border of Madison, about two blocks from their apartment. The couple put in an asking price offer with between 5 and 10% down.
They saw homeownership as the best move for their financial future — they are paying roughly the same for their mortgage as they previously paid for monthly rent.
""At the time, (the housing market) was like, 'normal' Nashville crazy,"" Haywood said.
With homes in the area increasingly selling for above asking price and all-cash offers from out-of-state buyers becoming more common, Haywood said he doesn't know if they would ""stand a chance"" of purchasing a home in today's climate.
""I think if we were to embark on (house hunting) this summer ... it would be a lot more intimidating,"" he said.
Recent low interest rates are giving first-time home buyers ""a little bit more buying power,"" said Meredith Zeller, a realtor with the LCT Team of Parks Realty. But in a market where more people are buying, prices are quickly rising.
She's seen buyers who would typically put down 20% dip into their down payment to cover shortfalls as they pay over list price and waive appraisals to stay competitive.
Home buyers can put down less than 20%, but it's not ideal, Zeller said — loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration might be more flexible with minimum down payments, credit scores and debt-to-income ratios, but they're ""not going to be quite as competitive as ... a conventional loan.""
Many of her buyers have rented in Nashville and decided that it made more sense to buy, she said, but some people have put off house hunting to wait for the market to slow down. With the market evolving at hyperspeed, they risk being priced out.
""That's tough for a lot of buyers,"" Zeller said. ""Where they could have afforded (a home) six months ago, they can't buy into those neighborhoods anymore.""
The cost of Nashville home ownership
Renting a home in Nashville is no longer necessarily cheaper than owning; renters' monthly housing costs converged with monthly homeownership costs in Davidson County in 2019.
With a 3% mortgage rate, a household able to pay 20% down on a $227,995 property would have an estimated monthly mortgage payment of $1,001.
Those who put down a 10% payment would pay $1,293 per month, including the cost of private mortgage insurance. That's about 24% of the average renter household's income, below the threshold for being considered cost-burdened (paying 30% or more of one's income for housing). The monthly mortgage payment with a 5% down payment would be about $1,352, according to Zillow.
The average rent in the Greater Nashville area is $1,337 per month in July, according to ApartmentData.com.
Tucker said it's difficult to compare the cost of renting versus home ownership because cost effectiveness depends on several factors including type of home, neighborhood and down payment.
""In the scheme of things, for the people who can get into it in Nashville, home ownership remains relatively affordable compared to renting similar homes,"" Tucker said.
In addition to the challenge of saving for a down payment, barriers to home ownership include access to credit and mortgage application approval.
For individuals who have a recent and/or serious credit delinquency in their history and those who do not have credit at all, securing a mortgage is ""very difficult,"" Tucker said.
""Even if that person is a perfectly safe credit risk, someone who has been paying their bills ... and has a secure job, mortgage lenders still expect to see some track record of actual debt and repayment, even if it's just paying off a credit card bill every month.""
Historic inequities mean more hurdles for Black and Latinx renters trying to save for down payments. They are less likely to have access to credit and financial help from family members, according to Zillow.
Nashville remains more affordable than other metros
Nashville renters will need an estimated two and a half years longer than the average American to save up for a 20% down payment on a $227,995 starter home. Zillow estimates it would take average U.S. renters saving 10% of their income about six years to put 20% down on a typical starter home worth $148,500.
But Nashville's housing market remains more accessible than home ownership in many other metropolitan areas, especially for new residents continuing to receive larger city salaries.
In New York City, renters would need about 11.7 years to save for a starter home. In Los Angeles, a typical renter would save for around 17.6 years for a 20% down payment on a starter property worth nearly $563,000.
Although 85% of people moving to the greater Nashville area come from other areas of Tennessee, the number of new residents from other, more expensive states is increasing.
The number of new residents from New York rose nearly 59% from 2019 to 2020, according to research by commercial real estate and investment firm CBRE. New residents from California rose nearly 26%, followed by Illinois with nearly 15%.
""For local residents, they're going to face increased competition from other homebuyers, in many cases coming from out of state, and in many cases coming from places where homes are substantially more expensive than in Nashville,"" Tucker said.
Homes in Nashville usually go under contract about four days after hitting the market, according to a Zillow report. In May, dozens of Nashville and neighboring Williamson County homes sold for $30,000 or more above asking price.
Tucker said he thinks this migration will spur increased housing development, but competition for housing will be fierce in the meantime.
""First-time homebuyers in Nashville who were hoping to buy in one neighborhood may have to settle for a more affordable neighborhood they hadn't initially been considering,"" he said.

861,"A recent bout with COVID-19 caused Ken Simpler Sr. to experience the return of paralysis-related symptoms he experienced when suffering from polio as a 9-year-old in 1954.
He would recover then to star on the football team at the old Rehoboth Beach High and play in the 1962 Blue-Gold all-star game.
This time, while recovering from several mini-strokes, Simpler's mood has been brightened by the approach of Friday night's 65th all-star renewal at Delaware Stadium in Newark.
""It gave me sort of a thrill to know that we had three generations participating in the same game,"" said Simpler Sr., 76, and still living in Rehoboth Beach, where he owned and operated the restaurant at what is now the Avenue Inn and Spa. ""Going to the game will be a big deal.""
Grandson Emmett Simpler, a recent Tower Hill School graduate, will be wearing No. 43 for the Blue, which seeks its first win since 2016.
It's the same number Emmett's grandfather wore in the 1962 contest for the Gold and his father, Ken Simpler Jr., donned in the 1985 game after graduating from St. Andrew's while also playing for the Gold.
""It's an honor to carry on the legacy and represent both my school and my family in the game,"" Emmett Simpler said after Tuesday's Blue team scrimmage at A.I. du Pont High's Tiger Stadium. ""It's really exciting.""
The all-star game benefits the Delaware Foundation Reaching Citizens with Intellectual DisABILITIES. DFRC has raised more than $6 million to aid programs throughout Delaware since the game's inception in 1956. It had been held annually before COVID-19 forced the cancellation of the 2020 contest.
Kickoff is at 7 p.m. Tickets are $12 to $22 and must be purchased online.
It's a North-South game, with Blue players being recent graduates from high schools above the C&D Canal and Gold players coming from schools south of it. The exception is Red Lion Christian, which is represented on the Gold.
""I used to go to the game so I knew in my future I might have a chance to play,"" Emmett Simpler said. ""I always kinda looked forward to it.""
He earned that chance after a stellar career at Tower Hill, where he became a regular as a sophomore running the football out of the Hillers' unusual single-wing attack. He then became a starting defensive back as a junior. Tower Hill made the Division II state tournament both seasons.
As a senior in 2020, which started late and was limited to five games because of COVID-19, Simpler rarely left the field.
""He was a true leader and the epitome of what a captain should be,"" Hillers coach Kevin Waesco said.
Simpler passed for 288 yards and ran for 396, both team highs, in 2020 for the 3-2 Hillers.
""I kinda called myself a tailback who also threw the ball,"" Simpler said of often taking the snap out of the single wing.
Simpler will likely line up at safety in Friday night's game.
Blue team coach Zeb Blum echoed Waesco in describing Simpler's value to the squad, which only has a week of practice.
""He gets it,"" said Blum, the A.I. du Pont coach. ""He understands the game and what it's about and he's excited about everything that has to do with DFRC. It means a lot to him to be here. And he has a strong knowledge of the technical aspects of football so that if you teach him something he goes out there and does it.""
Because of COVID-19 protocols, teams aren't practicing at the University of Delaware or staying in UD dorms as in the past. Also, interaction with their ""buddies"" in the game's Hand-in-Hand program, which matches game participants with cognitively disabled youngsters, has been limited to virtual events.
But Simpler, a Hockessin resident, has still enjoyed video interactions with 13-year-old Matthew Ray.
""It's been different this year but it's still been really nice,"" Simpler said.
Emmett's dad, Ken Simpler Jr. is thrilled to see his son take part, despite protocols that have curtailed traditional interaction.
""It always stuck with me as something very unique to Delaware because of our scale, the fact that we could bring a player from every high school in the state,"" said Simpler Jr., who was Delaware's state treasurer from 2015-18. ""You couldn't do that in a bigger state.
""It was just a neat experience, plus the fact that you're playing to benefit people with disabilities, who get so excited to be around the players, especially the really big guys. It's inspiring because their excitement gets you excited.""
Simpler Jr. suffered a knee injury during the first of the two weeks of Blue-Gold camp, which has since been reduced to one week, which limited some of his event participation. But he was able to play in the game with his knee in a brace and caught an 11-yard pass in the Gold's 12-7 loss to the Blue.
""I just remember it as being this incredible opportunity for a guy who grew up in southern Delaware and actually knew some of the Cape Henlopen players, but I hadn't played them because I'd gone to this small Independent school in Middletown,"" Simpler Jr. said. ""Being able to play with those guys stuck with me.""
Likewise, the Blue-Gold highlight for Simpler Sr. was being teammates with players from rival schools. He singled out Dover's quarterback Jim Somerville, who threw two TD passes and led the Gold in rushing in its 25-24 win.
Simpler Sr. was first-team All-State in 1961 when that entire unit included just 11 players after leading the Henlopen Conference with 86 points for an 8-0 team as a senior at Rehoboth Beach. He was the only Sussex County player among those 11. Lewes, Milton and Rehoboth Beach high schools became Cape Henlopen when Sussex County school districts were consolidated in 1969-70.
""I was able to have quite a sports career. When I was 10 years old they probably gave me a one-in-20 chance of doing that,"" he said, referring to his polio.
This will be Emmett Simpler's final football game as he's headed to Tulane University later this summer to study business. He missed his junior lacrosse season when spring sports were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, then had a shortened senior football season. Simpler was first-team All-Independent Conference on defense during a full senior lacrosse season.
""Just to be out here and able to practice is really nice,"" he said of the perspective gained from COVID-19 cancellations.
""I can tell I'm gonna miss football and it's just really nice to be selected to have this be my last game. To have a chance to play in front of the fans on Friday, I'm definitely excited for it.""
So is his grandfather.
""It'll be a little different rooting for the Blue team,"" Simpler Sr. said.

862,"The Hillsborough County teachers union has asked the school district for a salary package that would increase starting pay for all teachers to nearly $50,000 a year.The union says the district has the money, although district budget officials say they must spend cautiously and make adjustments to avoid another financial crisis. Last school year, the district was headed for a possible state takeover because of its low reserves. It was rescued in the eleventh hour by federal COVID-19 relief funds, but not before a stern rebuke from education officials in Tallahassee.Despite that history, and projections that the district could find itself in similar trouble a year from now, the union says the new pay plan is both affordable and necessary to stem an exodus of talent from the classrooms. The district is advertising for more than 400 teachers and about 1,100 employees in all.We want to make Hillsborough the place to teach in the West Coast of Florida, said Rob Kriete, president of the union.Kriete introduced the proposal Monday at one of the first bargaining sessions of this school year between teachers and the district. Earlier, using published budget documents, the union demonstrated that the district intends to spend $772 million in state dollars this year on instructional pay. That amount represents an increase of more than $70 million from last years spending, which came in below budget.District leaders said those figures do not mean there is an extra $70 million available.They said money is moved around over the course of the year to cover unexpected expenses  for example, textbook purchases that cost more than what the state allocated. They said the COVID-19 relief money that they are now using to build up the reserve is a short-term funding source and cannot be relied upon for ongoing spending.Romaneir Johnson, the districts chief financial officer, showed projected budgets for 2023 through 2025 that, without making adjustments, will result in more shortfalls and negative reserve amounts.These are just projections and budgets change, Johnson said. But if nothing changes, if we keep the people we have, and nothing changes over time, we are going to have an overall operational deficit of $100 million.The two sides also considered varying reserve amounts, with Kriete calling it egregious that, at one point, the district posted a 9.6 percent reserve. Johnson and her team said that percentage dropped after the district lost $28 million because more families took advantage of a state scholarship program that sends children to private schools. An amended budget shows the reserve at 3.8 percent. The state requires at least 2 percent.The proposed agreement would establish $49,200 as the salary for all teachers in their first through seventh year on the job. Starting pay is now $46,900, resulting from a new state law that requires districts to move their starting teacher salaries as close to $47,500 as possible.Kriete said that, with a starting salary well above the state minimum, the district can cushion itself against future mandates that pit the interests of new employees against veteran teachers.The union also wants the district to award annual supplements ranging from $500 to $5,000 to longtime teachers who have reached the salary ceiling of $68,400, special education teachers who are shouldering the administrative work of colleagues who lack certification, counselors with advanced academic degrees, and others.Kriete, using a preliminary estimate, said the proposed pay package should cost between $30 million and $35 million, which is about half of the $70 million budget increase he described.District leaders said they will do their own calculations to determine the price tag.It is not unusual for the union and district to begin the bargaining process far apart. Nor is it unusual for bargaining to last until the winter holidays or beyond. The next session is planned for Dec. 13.Contact Marlene Sokol at msokol@tampabay.com or 813-810-5068.

863,"SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 8, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Invitae (NYSE: NVTA), a leading medical genetics company, today announced financial and operating results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2021. 
""Year-over-year growth continued at a fast pace in the third quarter as volumes remained strong across the platform,"" said Sean George, Ph.D., co-founder and CEO of Invitae. ""In particular, progress in the oncology group is reflected in current volumes and preparations for high-value, high-margin product introductions over the coming year, supported by multiple ongoing studies. We saw continued progress in our data and platform services, underscored by the integration of Medneon and the Ciitizen technology platform that bolster our ability to collect, house and deliver benefits from patient data collected on their behalf. We look forward to continued robust volume growth in the coming periods as we introduce new testing capabilities and increase access to our lifelong testing and data platform.""
Third Quarter 2021 Financial ResultsGenerated revenue of $114.4 million in the quarter, a more than 66% increase compared to $68.7 million in the same period in 2020. Reported billable volume of 296,000 in the quarter, approximately 89% increase compared to 157,000 in the same period in 2020. Reported average cost per billable unit of $296 in the quarter compared to $297 average cost per billable unit in the same period in 2020. Non-GAAP average cost per unit was $249 in the quarter. Achieved gross profit for the third quarter of 2021 of $26.7 million, compared to $22.1 million in the same period in 2020. Non-GAAP gross profit was $40.7 million in the third quarter.Total operating expense, which excludes cost of revenue, for the third quarter of 2021 was $220.0 million compared to $102.9 million in the same period in 2020. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter was $201.8 million. 
Net loss for the third quarter of 2021 was $198.2 million, or a $0.91 net loss per share, compared to a net loss of $102.9 million, or a $0.78 net loss per share, in the third quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $175.9 million, or a $0.81 non-GAAP net loss per share.
At September 30, 2021, cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and marketable securities totaled $1.25 billion as compared with $1.54 billion as of June 30, 2021. Net increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for the quarter was $186.1 million. Cash burn was $286.0 million for the quarter. Cash burn for the quarter would have been $148.1 million excluding the cash paid for acquisitions, primarily related to the cash paid to acquire Medneon and Ciitizen.
Corporate and Scientific HighlightsAcquired patient-centric consumer health tech company Ciitizen to enhance Invitae's platform by providing patients an easy-to-use, centralized hub for their genomic and clinical information, which together comprise a powerful dataset with the potential to drive research and improve healthcare decision-making. Announced new data from the TRACERx lung cancer research collaboration. The data further validate the value of liquid biopsy as a less invasive and more comprehensive approach to guiding personalized cancer treatment. The data underscore previous findings from the TRACERx cohort that monitoring for cancer circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) based minimal residual disease (MRD) detected relapse of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) up to three years earlier than standard of care imaging surveillance in some instances. Presented research demonstrating that genetic findings informed clinical management changes that led to improved seizure control and outcomes in the majority of epilepsy patients with actionable findings. The findings were presented in September at the National Society of Genetic Counselors 40th Annual Conference.Outlook and GuidanceThe company has adjusted its 2021 annual revenue guidance to $450 million - $475 million, or year-over-year revenue growth of between 60% and 70%. The change in revenue outlook was primarily due to greater than expected seasonal impact in Q3.

Safe Harbor Statements This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements relating to the company's future  financial results, including guidance for 2021, long term topline growth expectations and the drivers of future financial results; the company's beliefs regarding the momentum in its business and the drivers of that momentum; the company's expectations regarding future growth; the company's expectations regarding future product introductions and expansions; the significance and benefits of the company's recent studies and collaborations; and the impact and benefits of the company's acquisitions, partnerships and product offerings. Forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, and reported results should not be considered as an indication of future performance. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to:   the impact of COVID-19 on the company, and the effectiveness of the efforts it has taken or may take in the future in response thereto; the company's ability to continue to grow its business, including internationally; the company's history of losses; the company's ability to compete; the company's failure to manage growth effectively; the company's need to scale its infrastructure in advance of demand for its tests and to increase demand for its tests; the risk that the company may not obtain or maintain sufficient levels of reimbursement for its tests; the ability of the company to obtain regulatory approval for its tests; the applicability of clinical results to actual outcomes; the company's failure to successfully integrate or fully realize the anticipated benefits of acquired businesses; risks associated with litigation; the company's ability to use rapidly changing genetic data to interpret test results accurately and consistently; security breaches, loss of data and other disruptions; laws and regulations applicable to the company's business; and the other risks set forth in the company's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2021. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date hereof, and Invitae Corporation disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements.
Non-GAAP financial measuresTo supplement Invitae's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), the company is providing several non-GAAP measures, including non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP cost of revenue, non-GAAP operating expense, including non-GAAP research and development, non-GAAP selling and marketing, non-GAAP general and administrative and non-GAAP other income (expense), net, as well as non-GAAP net loss and non-GAAP net loss per share and non-GAAP cash burn. These non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in evaluating the company's ongoing operating results and trends.
Management is excluding from some or all of its non-GAAP operating results (1) amortization of acquired intangible assets, (2) acquisition-related stock-based compensation, (3) post-combination expense related to the acceleration of equity grants or bonus payments in connection with the company's acquisitions, (4) adjustments to the fair value of acquisition-related assets and/or liabilities, including contingent consideration and (5) acquisition-related income tax benefits. These non-GAAP financial measures are limited in value because they exclude certain items that may have a material impact on the reported financial results. Management accounts for this limitation by analyzing results on a GAAP basis as well as a non-GAAP basis and also by providing GAAP measures in the company's public disclosures.
Cash burn excludes (1) changes in marketable securities, (2) cash received from equity or debt financings and (3) cash received from exercises of warrants. Management believes cash burn is a liquidity measure that provides useful information to management and investors about the amount of cash consumed by the operations of the business. A limitation of using this non-GAAP measure is that cash burn does not represent the total change in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash for the period because it excludes cash provided by or used for other operating, investing or financing activities. Management accounts for this limitation by providing information about the company's operating, investing and financing activities in the statements of cash flows in the consolidated financial statements in the company's most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Annual Report on Form 10-K and by presenting net cash provided by (used in) operating, investing and financing activities as well as the net increase or decrease in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in its reconciliation of cash burn.
In addition, other companies, including companies in the same industry, may not use the same non-GAAP measures or may calculate these metrics in a different manner than management or may use other financial measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP measures as comparative measures. Because of these limitations, the company's non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Investors are encouraged to review the non-GAAP reconciliations provided in the tables below.INVITAE CORPORATION

864,"John DeSantis gave the best advice.
""Growing up, my friends would always ask my dad for advice and my sons always asked him for advice. They felt comfortable around him - and he gave great advice. They would talk to him in confidence and know he wouldn't tell anyone what they talked about,"" said DeSantis' son, Mark Moore.
Those words of wisdom will carry on through DeSantis' memory.
DeSantis, the creator of the Pittsburgh Home & Garden Show, a shopping marketplace for 39 years, died Saturday from brain cancer. He was 69.
Slater Funeral Service on Greentree Road is handling the arrangements. Viewings will be held Friday and Saturday with a funeral on Jan. 10 at Calvary United Methodist Church on the North Side.
His death comes two months before the show will celebrate its 40th anniversary - March 4-13 at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown. The show was more than a place to find the state-of-the-art kitchen appliances and bathroom fixtures and the latest in furniture and landscaping for DeSantis.
It was his passion.
DeSantis organized the more than 1,800 vendors that filled the convention center. He hosted the event during the beginnings of the pandemic in March 2020, closing a few days early because of the spread of covid-19.
""It will be so difficult doing the show without him,"" said Moore, who has been the associate director and will become executive director. ""The show will keep me immersed and consume me the next few months, which isn't a bad thing. It's a living legacy and a tribute to my dad.""
He, his wife Kimberly and their sons, Shane, 18, and Riley, 16, were DeSantis' world, his son said.
[gps-image name=""4606681_web1_PTR-JohnDeSantis-1.jpg""]
The spring show will be a celebration of the event's 40th anniversary and will include some form of a memorial to DeSantis, Moore said.
They plan to continue the fall show. Moore said DeSantis never planned on retiring from the show.
""He always wanted this show to continue,"" Moore said. ""He had a deep love for the show and said he would do it without getting paid - he loved it so much.""
Moore, 52, of the North Side, spent the final few weeks caring for his father, who lived in the same neighborhood. He said his dad didn't want people to know he was ill because he didn't want to ruin their holiday. He loved celebrating the new year, so a friend of Moore's said his dad dying on Jan. 1 means that he made sure every year there will be a ""toast to John.""
He had three weeks of radiation prior to the fall show but didn't tell anyone at the event. This was his second bout with cancer. He was in remission from kidney cancer in 2018.
DeSantis and Moore saw 88 Jimmy Buffet concerts all over the world.
""My dad was a 'Parrot Head,'"" Moore said. ""We saw concerts in Paris and London and Dublin.""
Moore noticed his dad losing his balance on a trip to the Bahamas in August. When they returned home, a scan showed brain lesions. Surgery was out of the question.
Moore said his father did the show for the vendors and the people who attended as a way to connect homeowners with contractors and other businesses to help make their living spaces better. Pittsburgh was the go-to show, said Moore, who is president of the Home & Garden Show Executives International, an organization of show producers.
Calls and emails and text messages have been coming in from all over the world offering condolences, Moore said.
""One of the vendors left a message saying 'Your father cared about us, and always treated us fairly,'"" Moore said.
The convention center reached out and said ""it has our back with the upcoming show"" and they will do whatever Moore needs, he said. Moore has received messages saying the organization lost a ""true talent.""
He said he picked up things just by being around his dad. Moore's oldest son is also part of the business.
Moore said he hopes to show his son the same things his dad showed him.
[gps-image name=""4606681_web1_PTR-JohnDeSantis-2.jpg""]
Matt Hillebrand, one of the co-owners of Don's Appliances, a home show vendor, said via email that he met DeSantis and Moore during the first year he had a booth at the home show in 1998.
""What I found very memorable was how he wanted us to succeed in our display and carry that momentum through the year. He cared about us, and how our show was,"" Hillebrand said. ""As the years passed, I grew to know John and Mark on a personal level and found that his life focused around his kids and grandkids. John is a person this city will truly miss.""
""Our hearts are with the DeSantis family during this difficult time,"" said Hollie Geitner, director of communications for Duquesne Light Company, a title sponsor of the home show via email. ""John's energy and enthusiasm brought so much life to everything he planned. We enjoyed working with him over the past two decades on the annual Home and Garden Show. He will be greatly missed in the region.""
DeSantis often took his grandsons on vacations and would go for frequent walks with them, where they would collect sticks and pretend sword fight. He had one of those sticks resting near his fireplace that Moore noticed right after his dad passed away.
DeSantis took the boys to Gus & YiaYia's for an ice ball treat in West Park. An avid train collector, DeSantis and his grandsons visited the Carnegie Science Center to watch ""The Polar Express.""
The three watched it on his iPad in his final days. ""Tears rolled down his face,"" Moore said of DeSantis as he sat with his grandsons.
""My dad is irreplaceable,"" he said. ""There is a huge void that can never be filled. After hearing all of these kind words, I pulled my phone out to call my dad because I wanted to tell him that there has been such an outpouring of love.""
DeSantis was appointed by then-Mayor Sophie Masloff to lead the city's Historic Review Commission.
""The North Side is such an unbelievable neighborhood thanks to my dad's enthusiasm for preserving it,"" Moore said.
DeSantis helped restore Moore's house. On Thanksgiving, DeSantis looked around and said, ""What a great room,"" according to Moore. ""It was like he was taking it all in for one last time.""
In his last few days, when DeSantis was too weak to talk, they communicated via a whiteboard, where Moore wrote questions.
""I would ask what he thought about this and that concerning the home show and he would answer write an answer because he always had so much to share,"" Moore said. ""He was always ready to tell me what he thought. When I asked about doing the home show without him, he wrote, 'Son, you've got this.'""
Those were his final words of advice.CREDIT: by JOANNE KLIMOVICH HARROP",Pittsburgh Home &amp; Garden Show founder John DeSantis passes from brain cancer
867,"St. Charles resident and special needs mom Colette Ansley-Treonis cried tears of joy the day her 39-year-old son Josh, who has Asperger syndrome, received his Janssen COVID vaccine.
""I wanted to get the Janssen vaccine because Josh has a low patience level and I just wanted to be able to get one shot and have it done with,"" Ansley-Treonis said.
Josh, a St. Charles East High School graduate, was able to get his vaccine at the St. Charles Farmers Market on July 2.
The event was one of a series of community COVID vaccination clinics provided by the Kane County Health Department, Kane County Office of Emergency Management, and the mobile Illinois National Guard.
While Ansley-Treonis applauded the ease and speed of the vaccination clinic, she said the process of getting her special needs son ready that morning took some advance planning.
""I had to go pick him up, then I had to cut his hair and his beard, then he had to take a bath and then he had to get on clean clothes to go to the farmers market,"" she said.
Kane County Health Department officials said they will continue to provide community COVID vaccination clinics to ensure that all residents like Josh have access to the vaccines.
""The Kane County Health Department is prepared to visit community sites to support all needs of individuals,"" said Director of Disease Prevention Laura Barrett. ""If anyone has a specific concern about themselves or a family member seeking a vaccine, we encourage them to let the clinic greeters know and we will adjust to meet their needs. The vaccine is our best shot to end this pandemic.""
Ansley-Treonis says it’s a race to beat the clock and that parents need to get their children vaccinated as soon as possible, especially with the new Delta variant now accounting for more than half of all U.S. cases.
""Get out and get the vaccine,"" she said. ""You don’t know when or where you’re going to come in contact with this virus and it just protects your life.""

868,"RADNOR, Pa., July 27, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- NRx Pharmaceuticals (Nasdaq: NRXP) (NRx), a clinical stage, global biopharmaceutical company, today announced that the Nation of Georgia's Prime Minister and Minister of Health have issued an Emergency Use Authorization for intravenous ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil) for the treatment of Critical COVID-19.NRx Pharmaceuticals Announces Emergency Use Authorization of ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil) in Nation of Georgia""Lead investigators from our ZYESAMI™ clinical trials are on their way to the Nation of Georgia and will be on the ground there within 24 hours to start teaching physicians how to administer ZYESAMI™ to some of the sickest of COVID patients,"" said Prof. Jonathan Javitt, MD, MPH, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board of NRx. ""The repeating ferociousness of this pandemic is of great concern, and we hope ZYESAMI™ can have a real-world impact, comparable to what we saw in our clinical trials.""
The regulatory approval comes as Georgian doctors are seeing significant, daily increases in COVID-19 cases, hospitalized patients, and specifically, patients in hospital intensive care units.
""This latest wave of COVID-19, brought on by the delta variant has medical professionals in Georgia working throughout each day and night trying to keep people breathing,"" said Dr. Ivane Chkhaidze, a leading pulmonary physician in Georgia and a member the Association of Georgia Physicians Leadership Team. ""We appreciate the Prime Minister and Minister of Health authorizing the use of ZYESAMI™ and offering Georgian physicians a new treatment to help people recover from this devastating virus.""
Dr. Javier Perez-Fernandez, a lead investigator in the Phase 2b/3 clinical trial of intravenous ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil), and critical care pulmonologist in Miami, Florida, is leading the team of physicians traveling to Georgia to train fellow doctors there about administering ZYESAMI™ and the effects of the medicine. The first Georgian physicians trained in administering ZYESAMI™ comprise twenty of the leading critical care physicians in the country.
The first doses of ZYESAMI™ will arrive in the Nation of Georgia within 24 hours, and discussions are underway with the Ministry of Health to provide access to ZYESAMI™ to Georgians suffering with Critical COVID-19.
About ZYESAMI™/VIP in COVID-19
ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil) is a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) first discovered by the late Prof. Sami Said in 1970, and ZYESAMI™ is named in his honor. Although primarily concentrated in the lung, it was first purified from the intestinal tract. VIP binds specifically to the alveolar type II cell (ATII) in the air sac (alveolus) of the lung, where it has been shown have potent anti-inflammatory/anti-cytokine activity in animal models of respiratory distress, acute lung injury, and inflammation. VIP stimulates ATII cells to make the surfactant that must coat the lining of the lungs in order for them to exchange oxygen with the blood.  Loss of surfactant causes respiratory failure and alveolar collapse, which are hallmarks of COVID-19. 
COVID-19-related respiratory failure is caused by selective infection of the ATII cell by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The ATII cells are vulnerable because of their (ACE2) surface receptors, which serve as the route of entry for the virus. Coronavirus infection of the ATII cell shuts down surfactant production, triggers the formation of inflammatory cytokines, and causes cell death (cytopathy). VIP is shown to upregulate surfactant production, block Coronavirus replication in the ATII cell, block cytokine synthesis, and prevent viral-induced cell death (cytopathy). Other than ZYESAMI™, no currently proposed treatments for COVID-19 specifically target this mechanism of action.

869,"The entire recall campaign targeting Gov. Gavin Newsom has been built for months on the presumption that many, if not most, Californians are unhappy with how things are going, dissatisfied with their own lives, and losing hope for a solid future here. This, goes the premise, will make them leap to change leaders barely a year before the next regular election would give them the same option anyway.
Now come two university-level studies that bode very well for Newsom. Both conclude the mass ""California Exodus"" that this state's Republican politicians steadily bemoan largely a fiction. The vast majority of today's residents still believe in the California ""dream"" and have strong hope for the future.
High rents and real estate prices have not dented this seriously, say the studies, one from the University of California at San Diego and the other from a compendium of scholars there and at UC Berkeley, UCLA, Cornell, and Stanford universities.
As the recall vote draws close, the studies agree that at least two-thirds of Californians believe optimistically their lives will improve if they stay in the state.
The studies affirm there was population loss over the last year, but they also found much of it was caused by deaths from COVID-19, which has so far killed almost 64,000 Californians and infected a million.
For many people, the pandemic induced strong aversions to close personal contacts, a factor that reduced the high birth rate which usually helps California grow.
Among the vaccinated, both those factors are now gone, so the two studies agree that population losses will likely not continue.
All these items are good signs for Newsom, who has been a mixed bag as governor. Despite a slow start, he orchestrated the most successful mass vaccine rollout any state ever saw, driving COVID rates in California far below the Southern Republican-led states that fuel most of the current surge caused by the highly contagious Delta variant of the virus.
His length-of-pandemic rent and eviction controls, set by executive order and valid only until the current state of emergency ends, won him points with the state's fastest-growing population sectors, Latinos and Asian-Americans.
At the same time, he alienates others with his obvious hypocrisy is sometimes failing to obey the very rules he created.
Newsom, in every poll, figures to lose almost all Republican votes on the recall, while the vast preponderance of Democrats favors keeping him for now.
Those poll results do little to contradict the findings of the two academic studies, which concluded less than 20 percent of urban Democrats want to leave California. In contrast, about 40 percent of Republicans would consider getting out.
The UC San Diego study queried more than 3,000 Californians, 10 percent of them in Spanish. It found less than a quarter of all Californians seriously considering leaving the state, a slight decrease from the percentage so inclined in a 2019 UC Berkeley survey.
But residents of the Central Valley and rural Northern California counties were significantly less inclined toward staying, with about 30 percent thinking about moving away. It may be no coincidence that those areas lean significantly more to the GOP than the rest of the state.
This geography may have a major bearing on the recall, suggesting strongly that Californians' most dissatisfied Californians reside in counties where the highest population percentages signed recall petitions while circulating.
Both studies found middle-class Californians slightly less likely to believe in the California dream than lower-income or wealthy compatriots.
So the lower income brackets retain strong hopes of improving their lot, while the wealthy know they're doing fine. The results among varying age groups: 18- to 24-year-olds are far more likely to believe in a good future here than those aged 50 or more.
This is certainly not the picture of a grossly dissatisfied California painted by every Republican running to replace Newsom. The governor has not yet made that point. He needs to do it soon and loudly.
The bottom line: To beat the recall, Newsom must draw a turnout representative of all these population sectors. If he does, he can thrive. If not, he may be a political toast.

870,"MIDDLETOWN — Middletown-based Connecticut Humanities, the statewide, nonprofit affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities, has awarded the Arts Center Killingworth and Spectrum Art Gallery and Store in Essex an $11,400 cultural fund operating support grant.
The arts center and gallery will employ the grant money in a variety of ways with a keen focus on the growth and development of new and innovative programming, according to a press release.
Investment in the latest and most efficient technologies are also crucial, with new technology platforms including video conferencing, social media, and other forms of outreach between the organization and the communities they serve, it continued.
“We are truly thankful for this generous gift,” Barbara Nair, executive director of the organizations, said in a prepared statement. “With COVID-19 and the subsequent delta and omicron variants, traffic into the gallery and attendance for classes and workshops has been severely impacted.
“Less traffic means less revenue to develop and offer programs. But with this generous grant, we’ll be able to increase our programming and implement the best technologies to provide new and relevant art experiences — both in-person and online,” Nair added.

871,"City council has previously allocated $8 million of the funds to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and $6 million toward retention payments for city police, fire and health workers.
With 26 million of their funds remaining, city council at a meeting last week discussed allocation, collaboration with the county, and the financial devastation of the pandemic on city government.
According to city staff calculations, Springfield city government has lost more than $72.5 million in revenue over the past two years because of the pandemic. That includes a $28.3 million loss in 2020 and a $44.2 million reduction in 2021 — an 8.7 percent and 12.3 percent decrease in estimated city revenue if the pandemic had not occurred.
Much of that revenue loss has been supplemented by emergency federal aid — first in the CARES Act and now by the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA).
The $1.9 trillion ARPA was signed into law by President Joe Biden in March. More than $673 billion of those funds were set aside for state and local governments. In August, the city accepted its first installment of their total $40 million.
City council has previously allocated $8 million of the funds to the Springfield-Greene County Health Department to combat the COVID-19 pandemic and $6 million toward retention payments for city police, fire and health workers.
According to city administrators at the meeting last week, the Heath Department has received several federal grants that have covered COVID-related costs and has left the $8 million untouched. If another wave of the virus does not roll through southwest Missouri, the ARPA funds could be reallocated to other priorities.
""We want to give ourselves enough time to know if we will have another variant wave and I'd like to think that we can make that decision at least by the end of this calendar year,"" said city manager Jason Gage.
Councilmembers have promised to adhere closely to the results of a community survey conducted by the city last year. The poll found Springfield residents want the city to focus their ARPA money on crime, health and homeless services.
Residents were asked to rank different priorities on a five-point scale. The following is the percentage of surveyed residents who assigned a particular priority the highest ranking.
Public safety and crime prevention - 55 percent
Homeless and housing services – 40 percent
Community health and wellness – 37 percent
Premium pay for essential workers – 36 percent
Stabilizing and revitalizing neighborhoods – 29 percent
Quality of Life – 29 percent
Economic recovery and growth – 24 percent
Public facility preservation and enhancement – 22 percent
Of these top priorities, council has allocated funds to crime prevention and community health, but not homeless services. In part, that's because the city has applied to several federal ARPA grants to address homelessness. If those applications are approved, it would likely affect how the city would use their own ARPA allocation to fight homelessness.
The city is planning to apply for $3.8 million from the federal Housing and Urban Development Department's HOME-ARP grant.
According to HUD, such grants will assist individuals or households who are ""homeless, at risk of homelessness, and other vulnerable populations"" by providing ""housing, rental assistance, supportive services, and non-congregate shelter"" to reduce homelessness and increase housing stability across the country.
In creating their application, city planners consulted with 20 local homeless service providers.
""The top priority we heard from service providers is a need for more affordable rental housing,"" said city planner Bob Atchley at last week's meeting. ""What we're being told by homeless service providers is that we have an issue on the immediate shelter step, but we also have an issue at the last step. We have a serious need for additional rental housing.""
According to Atchley, Springfield's renters are more ""cost burdened"" than the state or nation as whole — creating ""many cases"" where low-income renters are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing.
Atchley expects the city's HOME-ARP application to be ready for council approval in two to three months.
The city also applied last summer for another HUD grant, which focuses on curbing the effects of the COVID-19 virus on the homeless community. Atchley called it a ""truly competitive grant"" that may or may not be awarded to Springfield.
Greene County ARPA process
The city also received an update on Greene County's ARPA process and how the city and county governments might collaborate.
The county was awarded $57 million in ARPA funds from the federal government, $5.7 million of which will be placed in a reserve fund. To aid in the rest's allocation, the county has divided the funds into three buckets.
Ten million of the remaining funds, approximately 20 percent, will be allocated ""to partner with our local fire protection districts, our other municipalities and even some reimbursements that we may have at the county level such as salaries or administrative cost,"" said Greene County administrator Chris Coulter.
The second bucket is focused on assisting businesses and non-profits in Greene County. Forty percent, or $20.5 million dollars, of the total funds will be allocated to these purposes — $8 million for small businesses and $12 million for non-profits.
Earlier this month, Greene County opened applications for the first round of small businesses funding, which is open through the end of May.
To apply for Greene County ARPA funds, click on the orange ""American Rescue Plan Act"" tab on the greenecountymo.gov homepage. Then click on the ARPA small business application sub-link to begin the registration process.
Nonprofit applications are still being developed and will open in the near future.

These are ""transformative projects"" for which the county has already received more than $200 million dollar's worth of requests.
Concerning collaboration with the city, Coulter said they will comb their application to flag any that applied for both city and county ARPA funds. Those projects could be open to joint funding or funding from one municipal entity.

874,"Mar. 31SET-listed Singha Estate Plc (S) is moving into the power plant business to leverage synergies with its commercial property, residential property and resorts and hotels businesses amid an increasingly unpredictable local and global business environment.
Thitima Rungkwansiriroj, chief executive officer, said an entrance into the new business is a part of the company's strategic plan to enhance its core property business.
""The Covid-19 pandemic affects all business sectors and not only in Thailand but also globally,"" she said. ""This crisis confirms our strategic plan is right. The four businesses will complement each other.""
This year will be a transition year for the company in which it is moving into the next phase of its development by embracing businesses that complement its three core property businesses  commercial property, residential property, and resorts and hotels.
Singha Estate aims to triple revenues to 20 billion baht within three years and generate recurring income, with a growth in profit and a sustainable business, while being resilient in every circumstance.
The company is also interested in related energy businesses, engineering services and other innovative services, she added.
Last week, Singha Estate announced that it has secured exclusive rights to acquire a 30% shareholding in three major co-generation power plants with a total capacity of 400 megawatts, at par value, and with a total investment of 1.39 billion baht.
The first plant is an operational 123MW combined cycle co-generation power plant that is owned and operated by Angthong Power Co. It is located in the World Food Valley industrial estate in Ang Thong province, central Thailand.
The second and third plants, each with a 140MW capacity, are greenfield operations that are currently under construction and will enter into service in 2023. Both are located in the World Food Valley industrial estate. The licences for these power plants are owned by B.Grimm Power (Ratchaburi) 1 Limited and B.Grimm Power (Ratchaburi) 2 Limited.
""Licences for power generation plants of this size are a very rare commodity, so we are especially pleased to have secured rights to a substantial stake in three important power plants. They will give us an immediate and sure-footed presence in this sector,"" said Mrs Thitima.
She said the options are made particularly attractive by the fact that 270MW, or close to 70% of the combined output of the three power plants, is already pre-sold at guaranteed prices.
""This assures us sustainable recurring revenues that will enhance the resilience of our business,"" she said.
Angthong Power is the only power plant in Thailand that is profitable even without the need to sell to independent users and 75% of its output is taken up through a 25-year power purchase agreement with the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand.
She said the use of advanced technology has reduced costs and further improved the margins of the business beyond initial estimates.
The three power plants are expected to generate 7.5 billion in revenues in 2024, she added.
""Apart from the synergy benefits that we foresee from these acquisitions, their returns as stand-alone businesses are also attractive.""
""We have a draw-down facility with banks so that Singha Estate only needs to put up minimal capital, and at the tail end under a 'back-end equity' arrangement,"" said Mrs Thitima.
Singha Estate has a low net debt-to-equity ratio of 0.96 and access to 25 billion baht in credit facilities.
Currently, its commercial property businesses include 140,000 square metres of office and retail space contributing approximately 15% of its total revenues in 2020.
It has 39 hotels and resorts with 4,600 keys across five countries, contributing approximately 24% of revenues while it has developed 23 residential projects including single detached houses, townhouses and condominiums under the Santiburi, The ESSE, and other brands, contributing 57% to its revenues.

877,"Florida reported 2,505 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday, sending the 7-day average below 3,000 for the first time since July 7, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
The state also increased its total death count by three. Florida counts deaths by the day they occur, not the day they are reported and it can take two weeks or more for a death to be reflected in the data.
The 7-day average for daily deaths was 240 on Wednesday, according to Sun Sentinel calculations based on the change in the states overall death count. The 7-day average for new daily cases was 2,870.
There have been 3,614,272 confirmed cases of COVID in the state and at least 57,303 Floridians have died since the start of the pandemic.
As of Wednesday, 3,153 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 in Florida, a 24.9% decrease from the previous week but slightly more than the 3,307 hospitalized on Tuesday.
Here are the latest statistics:
The CDC on Tuesday updated its county-by county COVID numbers, which it has released weekly. South Florida counties have among the lowest cases per capita in the state, this weeks data shows. The statistics are for the week of Sept. 27-Oct. 3.
Over the previous week:
Palm Beach County saw a 28% drop in cases and a 14% drop in deaths;
Broward County saw a 28% drop in cases and a 23% drop in deaths;
Miami-Dade County saw a 26% drop in cases and a 36% drop in deaths;
Orange County saw a 31% drop in cases and a 49% increase in deaths.
Florida continues to drop in rankings of cases per capita, falling to second-to-last as of Oct. 13, according to New York Times data. The data shows 14 COVID cases per 100,000 population in Florida. Alaska ranked first with 110 average cases per 100,000.
Florida still ranks near the top in deaths per capita. As of Oct. 3, the state was third with 1.12 deaths per 100,000 population  -  behind West Virginia with 1.76 and Idaho with 1.39, the Times data shows.
Floridas positivity rate has been declining since mid-August, a further indication the state may have passed the peak of the delta surge. The state releases positivity data

883,"Jun. 10 - A Union County man is the $1 million Vax-a-Million winner.
The top prize went to Mark Cline of Richwood, the Ohio Lottery announced Wednesday evening on live television.
Sara Afaneh of Sheffield Lake in Lorain County was announced as the winner of the four-year scholarship.
Gov. Mike DeWine congratulated Cline and Afaneh and reminded Ohioans that there are only two more drawings left.
The state is offering five $1 million prizes and five full college scholarships to Ohioans 12 and older who have received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine.
The vaccine incentive program initially gave vaccine rates a boost, but vaccination rates have dropped with the campaign now more than half over.
More than 3.3 million Ohioans entered their names for a shot at the $1 million prize, slightly up from the 3.2 million registered for last week's drawing. More than 143,000 youths are entered for the scholarship, up from just over 133,000 last week.
As of Tuesday, nearly 5.4 million people in Ohio have had at least one dose of the vaccine.
Here's what you should know about the drawings:
What are the prizes?
The Ohio Vax-a-Million campaign will award five $1 million prizes and five full college scholarships to Ohioans 12 and older who have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine.
Ohioans 18 and older are eligible for a $1 million prize and residents 12 to 17 are eligible for a scholarship.
Scholarships will cover room and board, tuition and books for four years at any Ohio state college, university or technical or trade school. The winners of the scholarships will choose which school they attend. However, winning the scholarship does not guarantee admission to any school.
The state will work with any winners who wish to attend a private Ohio university, Gov. Mike DeWine said previously.
Winners of the million dollar prize will be responsible for paying any related taxes.
When will the winners be announced?
The third round winners of the $1 million prize and college scholarship will be announced today.
Winners will be named at 7:29 p.m. on TV and online at https://ohiovaxamillion.com/prizes-schedule.html.
Additional winners will be announced on June 16 and June 23.
The Ohio Department of Health will use the time between the drawing and naming of the winners to verify that the winners are valid entrants and meet the campaign's rules. If a winner rejects the prize or is not eligible, the state will select the first alternate and so on until a valid winner is found.
When is the next drawing?
The next drawing is scheduled for Monday, June 14.
The Ohio Lottery is using a random number generator to select winners, which is a computer that randomly picks a winner and alternates for each drawing.
While the public will not be able to watch the drawing, a representative from the Ohio Auditor's Office will be present.
Prior to each drawing, the state will go through entries to remove duplicates.
Once the computer selects a winning number, it's entered into the database to reveal the winner. Then the lottery draw staff and representative from the auditor's office both sign off on the drawing.
The fifth and final drawing is scheduled for Monday, June 21.
For a behind the scenes look at random number generator drawings, view the video from the Ohio Lottery below:
How do you sign up?
To sign up, visit https://ohiovaxamillion.com/index.html and select ""Adult Registration"" for the $1 million drawing or ""12-17 Year Old Registration"" for the college scholarship drawing.
Participants also can call the Ohio Department of Health at 1-833-4-ASK-ODH between 9 a.m. and 8 p.m. to register.
To be eligible to win, entrants must be a permanent Ohio resident and U.S. citizen with who has received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine the Sunday prior to the drawing date. Participants must be 12 or older.
Entrants do not need to have been vaccinated in Ohio to be eligible, however, ODH will ask for proof of vaccination.
Eligible residents can only enter once. Entries not selected will automatically carry over to the next drawing.
Who has won already?
Ohio announced the winners of the second drawings last Wednesday.
Jonathan Carlyle of Toledo won $1 million and Zoie Vincent from Mayfield Village in Cuyahoga County won the scholarship.
Carlyle plans to use the prize to purchase a home for his family, which includes his 5-month-old son.
""This is so welcome,"" he said. ""I can't explain how much pressure this is going to take off.""
Vincent will be a high school senior next year and has already started thinking about college and her future.
""I'm definitely interested in medicine,"" she said.
Vincent is considering Ohio State University and Case Western Reserve University for college, but is also looking at other schools.
Joseph Costello, 14, of Englewood, and Abbigail Bugenski, a GE Aviation employee who lives in Hamilton County, won the first round of prizes.
During a press conference with the governor, both winners shared their shock at being selected.
Bugenske, who won $1 million, said she thought it was a prank and Costello said he still hadn't really processed it yet.
Costello, who won the scholarship, isn't sure what he wants to study in college, but is considering Miami University or Ohio State University.
Bugenske said she had plans to buy a used car and would donate some of the $1 million prize to charity and also invest it.

889,"Jan. 5BILLINGS  Early in the fourth quarter Monday night, Rocky Mountain College guard Kloie Thatcher drove hard into the paint and barreled shoulder-first into Montana Western defender Sydney Sheridan.
It was an obvious offensive foul  and it elicited a loud squawk from Sheridan that echoed in a spectatorless environment, but she hung in there and took the collision like a champ. It also was a sign of frustration from Thatcher, who spent nearly 40 minutes trying to run Rocky's offense against the Bulldogs' persistent pressure.
In the end, Western got the best of the Battlin' Bears 79-66 in the first game played at RMC's Fortin Center in exactly 10 months. The Bulldogs improved to 4-1 and 2-1 in the Frontier Conference. It was the first outing of the season for Rocky, and served as the opening game of a doubleheader with the men's teams.
The Bulldogs won the men's game 73-64. Fans were not allowed into the arena for either game due to COVID-19 protocols.
Brynley Fitzgerald had a doubled double of 19 points and 15 rebounds, while rising sophomore Shainy Mack added career-high 22 points on 8-of-11 shooting to lead the Western women.
After opting out of any non-league games and having its first four Frontier Conference contests canceled due to the pandemic, the game was more of a learning experience for a Rocky team filled with many new faces.
But that wasn't much consolation for Thatcher, who is taking on a bigger role this season in terms of both statistical production and leadership. And Thatcher agreed that her offensive foul was a microcosm of the torment she and the Bears faced from the Bulldogs' in-your-face defense.
Thatcher, formerly a standout at Butte Central High School, finished with 11 points but only managed to attempt one shot in the second half, a 3-pointer that hit nothing but net. She also had eight assists, but as a team the Bears turned the ball over 23 times.
""When we drive we're supposed to drive hard, so that's my fault,"" Thatcher said afterward, an apologetic tone coming from behind her face covering.
""We knew going in it was going to be a battle and what their goal was. I just don't think we had an idea on how well they were going to do it. We just didn't do what we were supposed to do.""
Fitzgerald's double didn't come as a particular surprise, but Mack's performance was a bit of a coming out party for 5-foot-8 guard who led Three Forks to an undefeated season and a state title as a senior in 2018.
Mack scored nine of her 22 points in the third quarter, and also finished with five rebounds, five steals and four assists.
""Shainy's a kid that knows nothing but winning and working hard,"" Western coach Lindsay Woolley said. ""She came from a great high school program that won a lot of games. She's got good instincts, and you can see it.""
One big bright spot for Rocky was the play of newcomer Shauna Bribiescas, a transfer from Pima Community College in Arizona. Bribiescas scored a game-high 23 points and hit 5 of 7 from the arc. She also had seven rebounds.
Rocky post Mackenzie Dethman spent most of the game on the bench in foul trouble, which did the Bears no favors both in term of scoring or rebounding. Still, they kept the game close until the later until the fourth quarter and cut a 12 point deficit to one before halftime.
Western lost Jenni Weber to an apparent ankle injury in the second quarter, and was also without Seeley-Swan product Paige Holmes, a productive senior.
The teams will play again Tuesday at the Fortin Center at 4 p.m. The men's game will follow at 6.
""In the first quarter they got us on our heels and in the second quarter they had a chance to really open it up,"" Rocky coach Wes Keller said. ""They punched us and we responded at times, but ultimately when we got it close several times I felt like we turned it over or missed an easy one. But credit their defense.""

893,"Teachers unions are systemically racist.
Don’t get mad at me for saying it; I don’t make the rules of woke terminology. But under the sweeping definition of “systemic racism” the liberal Left has embraced, teachers unions’ incessant fight to keep schools closed most certainly qualifies.
NAACP President Derrick Johnson defines systemic racism as “systems and structures that have procedures or processes that disadvantages African Americans.” A writer at liberal news outlet Vox said systemic racism is a term “used to talk about all of the policies and practices entrenched in established institutions that harm certain racial groups and help others.”
More broadly, professor Ibram X. Kendi, a celebrated left-wing thinker, argued that racism exists wherever racial disparities do: “When I see racial disparities, I see racism.”
Conservatives don’t and shouldn’t necessarily accept this definition. But it’s entirely fair to hold liberal groups — teachers unions donate huge sums almost exclusively to Democrats — to their own standards. So, let’s apply this definition of “systemic racism” to the teachers unions’ fight to avoid opening schools and maintain failed “distance learning” schemes.
First and foremost, let’s be clear that there’s no scientific or safety-based justification for keeping schools closed. Some countries, such as Denmark, never closed their schools, and the fearmongers’ predicted COVID-19 hot spots never materialized.
And even the liberal-leaning Washington Post reported that “in-person schooling has not been associated with substantial transmission in the wider community. Multiple studies found transmission rates inside schools are similar to, or lower than, levels in the community when mitigation steps are in place.”
International research and domestic real-world studies have similarly shown that there’s no special COVID-19 risk associated with in-person schooling. If anything, it’s far safer than many forms of “essential” in-person gathering we have allowed to take place.
The teachers unions are simply fighting to not have to do their job. Why? Frankly, it’s hard to avoid the conclusion that they have political and selfish motives. 
A major Los Angeles teachers union demanded socialist healthcare, defunding the police, a wealth tax, and a ban on charter schools that compete with traditional public education before they would return to work. A North Carolina teachers union also demanded “Medicare for all” and more welfare for illegal immigrants before reopening schools. And a San Francisco teachers union even demanded the installation of new toilet lids before returning to work. (This demand had no basis in recommendations from public health authorities.)
These are just a few examples, but there’s concrete evidence proving that politics, not science, is what’s behind school closures. A comprehensive data analysis found that school closures correlated strongly with union strength, but not with actual COVID-19 prevalence and death statistics.
Suffice it to say the teachers unions’ push to keep schools closed is fundamentally unjustified. And it’s wreaking havoc on an entire generation of students, and especially minority students.
It’s easy to see why.
A significant racial wealth gap persists in this country, and white families are more likely to have parents with white-collar, remote jobs or parents who can afford child care and assistance with their child’s remote schooling. This has meant more minority children slipping through the cracks during the “distance learning” experiment teachers unions have forced us into.
The Census Bureau said that nearly twice as many black and Hispanic students have had no access to live teaching as white students. And a McKinsey analysis found that due to the losses from school closures, “Students of color could be six to 12 months behind, compared with four to eight months for white students.” McKinsey also estimated that white students will, on average, earn $1,348 less annually over their lifetimes due to school closures, but for black students, it will be $2,186 a year.
The data are overwhelmingly clear on this front: School closures have hit minority students and families disproportionately hard. And schools have only remained closed because of the pernicious influence of teachers unions prioritizing their own interests over those of students.
Using liberal definitions, it’s entirely fair to say that teachers unions are perpetuating systemic racism, making them systemically racist organizations. No, this doesn’t mean individual teachers or individual union members are bigoted. It doesn’t even necessitate any actual racist intent on the teachers unions' behalf.
But it’s indisputable that teachers unions’ obstinate fight to keep schools closed is hurting minority students at a widely disproportionate rate. And by the Left’s own terms, there’s only one word for that: racism.

",Your guide to the 2021 Boston Marathon on Oct. 11
895,"Apr. 15 - Seven Kanawha Valley girls basketball teams go for sectional championships Friday as postseason play heats up around West Virginia.
One of those participants is Capital (8-6), which hasn't been in this position in a while. When the Cougars knocked off South Charleston 44-38 in the Class AAAA Region 3 Section 1 semifinals on Wednesday, it was their first postseason victory since 2016.
They earned the right to take on the section's top seed, George Washington (12-3), at 7 p.m. Friday at GW High School. The Patriots, ranked No. 3 in the final Associated Press AAAA state poll, have beaten Capital twice already this season by scores of 57-35 and 59-45.
Cougars coach Michael Cunningham, whose program is seeking its first winning season since 2011-12, knows his players have to focus of guarding GW 3-point shooters such as Kalissa Lacy, Macie Mallory, Vivian Ho and Finley Lohan.
""We've just got to get on them shooters,"" Cunningham said. ""They've got a team full of shooters. They get out and spread the floor, and they look for those shooters. They're high volume 3-point shooters, but they make a good percentage of them.
""So it's just get a hand up and challenge them and make every shot tough. That's the goal. They've been leading this section for a while, so hopefully step by step, we're going to get there. It's a blessing to get to this point.""
Three more Kanawha Valley teams are competing Friday in Class AAA sectional championship games  -  Sissonville (6-7) hosts Midland Trail (7-0) in Region 3 Section 2, while Winfield (7-9) visits Nitro (12-1) in Region 4 Section 1. Both games are scheduled to begin at 7.
Sissonville moved into the sectional finals  -  which also carries a berth into next week's regionals  -  without playing a game. Nicholas County, the Indians' scheduled first-round opponent in Region 3 Section 2, is currently under quarantine and can't play, so Sissonville advances uncontested. Like in football, no forfeit wins or losses will be issued when teams are held out of postseason games due to COVID protocol.
Since 2009, teams that lose in the sectional final round are not eliminated from postseason play, but must go on the road in the regional co-finals in order to obtain a berth in the state tournament.
Sissonville and Midland Trail did not meet during the regular season, but Nitro bested Winfield 57-41 on March 9.
The remaining Kanawha Valley teams in Friday's sectional finals are Buffalo (7-3) and Charleston Catholic (7-4) in Class AA Region 4 Section 1 at Catholic's Athletic Facility. First throw-in there is also set for 7.
The Irish downed the Bison 42-28 during their March 10 regular-season game.

 Hawaii Department of Health officials reported 460 new confirmed and probable coronavirus infections today, bringing the state’s total since the start of the pandemic to 52,199 cases.   No new virus-related fatalities were reported today so the statewide COVID-19 death toll remains 552.   The state’s official coronavirus-related death toll includes 426 fatalities on Oahu, 62 on Maui, 59 on Hawaii island, two on Kauai and three Hawaii residents who died outside the state.   The U.S. coronavirus-related death toll today is over 622,000 and the nationwide infection tally is more than 37 million.   Today’s new confirmed and probable infection count by island includes 330 new cases on Oahu, 21 on Maui, 84 on Hawaii island, 15 on Kauai, two on Molokai, and seven Hawaii residents diagnosed outside the state.   State health officials have been including probable infections in its total case counts. Probable infections include people who never received a confirmatory test but are believed to have had the virus because of their known exposure and symptoms or because of a positive antigen test.   The total number of confirmed and probable coronavirus cases by island since the start of the outbreak are 37,222 on Oahu, 6,087 on Maui, 5,753 in Hawaii County, 868 on Kauai, 120 on Lanai and 130 on Molokai. There are also 2,019 Hawaii residents who were diagnosed outside of the state.   The statistics released today reflect the new infection cases reported to the department on Sunday.   Health officials also said today that, of the state’s total infection count, 8,238 cases were considered to be active. Officials say they consider infections reported in the past 14 days to be a “proxy number for active cases.” The state’s total number of active cases increased today by 73.   By island, Oahu has 5,708 active cases, the Big Island has 1,436, Maui has 750, Kauai has 294, Lanai has three and Molokai has 47.

898,"PHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia Eagles added an extra first-round pick next year before selecting the Heisman Trophy winner, and spent the rest of the draft focused mainly on defense.
Trading up to take Alabama wide receiver DeVonta Smith at No. 10 overall after moving down from the sixth spot to the 12th easily was the highlight of Philadelphia’s draft. The Eagles got a high-ceiling offensive lineman with a long injury history when they took Crimson Tide center Landon Dickerson in the second round.
They took Louisiana Tech defensive tackle Milton Williams in the third round and picked up two more defensive linemen in the sixth round Saturday: USC tackle Marlon Tuipulotu and Coastal Carolina end Tarron Johnson.
Philly began Day 3 by filling a need at cornerback, choosing Texas Tech’s Zech McPhearson. The Eagles took Memphis running back Kenneth Gainwell in the fifth round and a pair of linebackers in the seventh round: LSU’s JaCoby Stevens and Tulane’s Patrick Johnson.
“It’s hard to make judgments tonight,” general manager Howie Roseman said Saturday. “It’s hard to know anything other than we went into it with a process and a plan to bring the right people into the organization, the right people into the building.”
Getting Smith gives Philadelphia a playmaker at a position it has struggled and hasn’t had a 1,000-yard receiver since Jeremy Maclin in 2014. Smith reunites with quarterback Jalen Hurts, who played at Alabama before transferring to Oklahoma.
The Eagles fired coach Doug Pederson and traded quarterback Carson Wentz after going 4-11-1 last season, so they entered the draft looking to add talent regardless of position because they have plenty of holes.
IN THE GENES
McPhearson comes from a family of athletes. His parents and seven older siblings played college or pro sports. The 5-foot-11, 191-pound McPhearson played two seasons at Penn State and the last two with the Red Raiders. He was a team captain as a senior and had 120 tackles and four interceptions.
“Just being the youngest sibling and absorbing all the information they got and being there and learning from them has definitely helped me,” McPhearson said. “I would definitely say leaning on my brothers who played on the big stage, too, they have a lot of information and a lot of tips and keys that have helped me along my journey.”
IT’S IN THE NAME
If Gainwell gains yards well, he’ll be a big part of Philadelphia’s offense. He opted out a week before the start of last season following a funeral for an uncle, the fourth member of his family to die from COVID-19.
The 5-foot-11, 201-pound Gainwell ran a 4.42 40-yard dash at his pro day and had six straight 100-yard rushing games in 2019. He’ll get an opportunity for playing time behind Miles Sanders.
“I’m basically kind of like a straight-line guy,” he said. “I’m kind of just a guy that can catch the ball, run the ball, and get straight up field.”
D-LINE DEPTH
The 6-foot-2, 307-pound Tuipulotu had 8 1/2 sacks and 15 tackles for a loss in four seasons. He didn’t start playing organized football until his freshman year in high school.
Tuipulotu and Williams provide depth behind Fletcher Cox and Javon Hargrave.
The 6-foot-2, 254-pound Jackson had 26 1/2 sacks in four seasons, including 16 1/2 the past two years. He was a finalist for the Bronko Nagurski Trophy given to the most outstanding defensive player in college football.
“I’m the guy that’s trying to come off the ball as hard as he can, trying to be violent with my hands,” Jackson said. “I definitely would describe my pass rush game as relentless.”
VERSATILE LINEBACKERS
Stevens played safety at LSU and Johnson was an edge rusher at Tulane, but the Eagles listed both players as linebackers.
“They said they want me to be a guy to come in and be able to be a good edge rusher for them and sack the quarterback and get some hurries and rushes,” Johnson said.
Stevens said he has no preference where he plays.
“My thing is about coming in and being able to contribute any way possible, so if they have me come in and want me to play linebacker or safety, regardless of what position they want me to play, my job now is to contribute to the Philadelphia Eagles’ defense,” Stevens said.
HE’S STILL HERE
The Eagles and three-time Pro Bowl tight end Zach Ertz seem destined for a divorce but he hasn’t been moved yet. Trading him or releasing him in June would save the Eagles about $8.5 million in cap space this offseason, so waiting one more month benefits the team from that standpoint.

899,"MARS HILL, Maine -- Senior Julianna Morningstar came off the bench to score 17 first-half points, helping to lead Presque Isle to its sixth consecutive victory to begin the season, 76-41 over Central Aroostook Thursday in Mars Hill.
The Wildcats beat the Panthers at home six days earlier, 63-40, but were even more impressive in the second outing.
Presque Isle bolted to a 20-5 advantage after the first quarter and increased the margin to 45-20 at halftime, combining accurate shooting with a stingy defense against the defending Class C state champions.
""I really loved the energy and determination we played with,"" said Presque Isle coach Jeff Hudson. ""I also like the confidence with which we shoot the ball. Julianna was obviously on fire in the first half, but we got contributions from everyone on both ends of the floor.
""It was a great game for us in a lot of ways,"" he added.
Morningstar, who netted four 3-pointers, finished with 20 points and led a parade of five PI players in double figures. Juniors Courtney Kane and Faith Sjoberg logged 14 points each, while senior Rhylee Kinney and sophomore Anna Jandreau each tallied 12.
The Panthers' record dropped to 2-3. Sophomore Kira Fitzherbert was a bright spot with 17 points, including a 6-for-6 performance from the foul line. Senior Libby Grass added 10 points.
Hudson said he has come to grips with the fact the team won't have a chance to compete in the Northern Maine Class B Tournament, which normally would have gotten underway Feb. 12, but has been cancelled due to COVID-19. Still, the veteran coach said he's very pleased with the way his team has performed through the midway point of its revised schedule against Aroostook County squads.
""It's disappointing there is no tournament because as surprising as it seems, we would be a very, very dangerous team [in Class B] with our size, length and shooting ability,"" he said.

901,"The stealth subvariant is coming; it is entering the viral war zone, finding us where we are already hunkered down, lacking adequate weapons, afraid.
This is the fear version of reality, the message the news media use to stoke us into a frenzy. They know how to probe our weak points, know how to keep us in a state of alarm, know that we will continue to hide behind our masks as we walk alone along the dark, cold streets, nervously looking for signs that an interloper harboring omicron BA.2 may be nigh.
But what is the serious science here? Omicron BA.2 has more than 30 mutations that are the same as BA.1 but over 20 that are different. But please note that ""mutations"" is another fear term. Mutations are not automatically bad, and they do not necessarily mean ""more dangerous."" In fact, sometimes it's the opposite.
This subvariant first emerged in South Africa and has taken root in Denmark, the United Kingdom, Germany and India, and overall in 40 countries, including the U.S.
Not truly a 'stealth' subvariant
The proportion of subvariant cases is growing and beginning to dominate, growing to close to 50% of cases in Denmark, for example. That is because it is believed to be 1½ times more transmissible than the original BA.1 omicron variant and it means it that will likely soon crowd it out.
But is that automatically bad, and is it really a ""stealth"" subvariant? The answer is no. PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2 look for three short sequences specific for the virus, and the omicron BA.1 subvariant is unable to detect one of the three, known as the S gene.
This characteristic inability has enabled us to tell the difference between omicron and delta, but with delta mostly gone, we can now use the PCR to help us track the increase in omicron BA 2. So the fear term ""stealth"" is not appropriate.
Will this subvariant evade the vaccine? The answer so far is no. In fact, evidence from the United Kingdom shows that three doses of the MRNA vaccines are mostly effective at preventing symptomatic infection from omicron BA.2 as well as BA.1.
Not only that, but so far there is no sign of a resurgence in countries or regions where BA.1 has already surged, meaning that omicron immunity from infection appears to be holding against the new subvariant. It may even hasten the end of the pandemic, as it spreads more easily and shows no evidence of making people sicker.
This pattern is exactly what happened toward the end of the 1918 flu pandemic, when variants and subvariants of flu emerged that were more and more transmissible but less and less virulent and deadly.
Of course, there is no guarantee that this trend will continue. So we need to do what we can to help ourselves in the meantime.
Unfortunately, we lack many of the essential tools. Where is the federal public-private partnership we need and had under the prior administration to give us more anti-viral tools? The delays in tests and treatments have been one of the biggest failures of the Biden administration.
We need greater access
to anti-viral treatments
Given several million new cases of omicron per week, we need much more than the 20million courses of the anti-viral Paxlovid that have been ordered or the million-plus doses of the monoclonal antibody Sotrovimab for high-risk patients.
We need a greater investment in next-generation vaccines, especially the nasal vaccine being developed at Yale University that may prevent infection entirely.
The case numbers, hospitalizations and deaths from COVID are dropping precipitously in New York and throughout the Northeast. The rest of the country will soon follow.
I can see the end of the pandemic on the horizon, and the best way to ensure that I am not seeing an illusion is to provide me with the treatments I need rather than more rhetoric.

""We had a slow start in the first and second period, and I made some line combination adjustments going into the third,"" Thunder acting coach Alex Drulia said. ""I think that started the offense going, but it wasn't enough to get the two points.""
Massimo Pietroniro scored a goal and had two assists to pace the Cyclones (9-10-2, 20 points).
After a scoreless first period, the Cyclones got on the board first, about eight minutes into the second period, when Massimo Pietroniro scored his fifth goal of the season. Kris Pietroniro and Chris Tamer had assists on the goal.

With 14 seconds remaining in the second period, Preston Park scored to stretch the Cyclones' advantage to 2-0.
Then, a little past the eight-minute mark of the third period, Northern's David Wilcox beat Thunder goalie Connor Leslie (30 saves) and scored off a faceoff win by Massimo Pietroniro, making the lead 3-0.
The Thunder (10-13-1, 21 points) ended Cyclones goalie Jed Baliotti's shutout bid when defenseman Zach Connor scored off a rush midway through the third period.
Drulia said after the game that the Thunder didn't make Baliotti (23 saves), who has committed to play at the University of New Hampshire, work hard enough throughout the game. Baliotti recently joined the Cyclones from the Green Bay Gamblers of the United States Hockey League.

""Obviously, with a new goaltender you haven't seen, we need to do a better job to get shots on net,"" Drulia said. ""We didn't test him that much. But you have to give the Cyclones credit, they play a heavy, physical game. Obviously, our guys shied away from their game today.""
Drulia said thought the Thunder tried to stickhandle too much in the first two periods instead of making the simple plays.
Massimo Pietroniro notched his second assist as Brennan Dickey's goal stretched the Cyclones' lead to 4-1 with a little over seven minutes remaining in the third period.
Troy Ladka added the Thunder's second goal with three minutes remaining in the game. Recent additions Timur Alishlalov and Eamon Doheny had the assists.
Both teams were scoreless on the power play.

Months before Cristiano Amon started as CEO of Qualcomm Inc., he already was at work on his first crisis. To solve it, he sat in a mostly empty meeting room in Taipei and pleaded with executives from one of the world's biggest semiconductor makers for more chips.
He needed the help so that Qualcomm, a designer of circuits that go into hundreds of millions of electronic devices every year, could chase new markets and meet demand from big customers such as Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. and China's top handset makers. In fact, he needed the assistance so much that he got permission from the Taiwanese government to arrive in March and then waited through a three-day quarantine. Once he and his team got to the meeting place in a Taipei hotel, they negotiated with counterparts across a large room outfitted with microphones and speakers to communicate.
""I'm a very big believer that sometimes you have to meet folks in person,"" said Mr. Amon, who was named chief executive in January and officially took over in June.
Many new CEOs across the business world had to adjust to their roles amid unprecedented pandemic-era restrictions, getting to know key employees without ever meeting them in person and managing offices and business relationships from far away. Few can say they had a more tumultuous transition than Mr. Amon, a gregarious Brazilian who revels in person-to-person contact.
He is juggling a cluster of major challenges -- a global chip shortage, a sudden shift in a key market, and an unexpected acquisition opportunity -- while trying to put his own stamp on a company after working there for more than two decades. He wants to focus on an expansion beyond Qualcomm's core mobile-phone chip business, a shift that began before he took over.
""I've been doing many things in parallel and I want to succeed in them all,"" he said in an interview. ""I can't afford not to do them because we're in a hurry.""
The jury is still out on Mr. Amon's young tenure. Qualcomm's stock has fallen to $126.55 as of Friday's close, from around $152 the day he was announced as the next CEO. Investors are worried about how long the company can benefit from a transition to the superfast, next-generation wireless standard known as 5G, and whether Apple will start making its own mobile-phone communication chips, said SMBC Nikko Securities America analyst Srini Pajjuri.
Mr. Amon's pursuit of new markets is the right strategy, said Jeffrey Helfrich, a portfolio manager at Dallas-based Penn Davis McFarland, a firm with a Qualcomm stake that is among its largest holdings. But he said the company needs to stay on top technologically and avoid the return of old bugbears, including a legal battle with Apple over how royalties are collected on innovations in smartphone technology. Qualcomm and Apple resolved that fight in 2019.
""Do you think that their dispute with Apple is over forever? I don't,"" he said.
Mr. Amon, an electrical engineering graduate of Universidade Estadual de Campinas outside of Sao Paulo, worked at multinational telecom companies in Brazil and had two stints at Qualcomm starting in 1995 and again in 2004. The 51-year-old father of three was a rising star at the company for years, becoming president in 2018.
San Diego-based Qualcomm was founded in 1985 by a group of engineers led by Irwin Jacobs, who became the company's first CEO. His son, Paul, succeeded him and handed the reins to Steve Mollenkopf in 2014. Those leaders pioneered ways of connecting cellphones to cell towers and made Qualcomm a ubiquitous player in cellular equipment. Mr. Mollenkopf, known for his reserved demeanor, saw the company through a tumultuous period of lawsuits, antitrust scrutiny and a hostile takeover attempt by rival chip maker Broadcom Inc.
Mr. Amon strikes a contrast with Mr. Mollenkopf, who retired in June. His outgoing style is well suited for the tasks of courting new customers and scouting for new business. Mr. Amon shook up the company's management to help with that transformation, bringing in roughly 20 new executives. That group includes people with backgrounds in cloud computing, personal computers and auto technology, he said.
He didn't have a lot of time to settle in to the job. Shortly before getting the nod, he had a bout with Covid-19, which he contracted around Christmas. Once recovered, he resumed globe-trotting to stay ahead of a crippling chip supply crunch that raised prices for electronics and hampered production of everything from cars to home appliances to PCs.
That shortage, which he predicts will ease in the first half of 2022, put Qualcomm in a tricky position. While the company designs communications and data-processing chips, it relies on others to manufacture them, which means it doesn't fully control its destiny. Securing manufacturing capacity is critical to Mr. Amon's longer-term aspiration of getting Qualcomm's chips into more automobiles, drones and other devices.
One of Mr. Amon's first stops after being named to the corner office was South Korea, which was followed by the trip to Taiwan in March, then back to South Korea in May. Those countries are home to some of the world's biggest chip makers and key Qualcomm suppliers, including South Korea's Samsung Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.
Before he got the top job, Mr. Amon was a frequent visitor to these places to meet with industrial partners. But the pandemic and the global chip shortage made this year's sojourn unfamiliar. Everywhere he faced similarly stringent anti-Covid measures, such as a government escort in Taiwan from the airport to the government-approved hotel he couldn't leave. When in Taiwan, Mr. Amon usually dropped in at the original location of the renowned dim sum restaurant Din Tai Fung. Covid nixed that ritual.
Qualcomm is also vying for a bigger share of the cellphone chip market in China. That battle intensified in the past year after U.S. restrictions on Huawei Technologies Co. crippled the Chinese telecommunications giant. Huawei made many of its own chips, while the companies vying to gobble up its market share sourced from Qualcomm and its competitors.
To encourage suppliers to boost Qualcomm's manufacturing capacity, Mr. Amon made moves uncommon in the industry, agreeing to pay in advance for supplies and entering into contracts that are longer than typical. Mr. Amon said he felt heat from Qualcomm customers concerned about the shortage, even from users of its products that don't buy directly from the company.
""I cannot find a customer that we're not getting pressure from directly and indirectly,"" he said. ""It is a pressure cooker right now.""
Mr. Amon also met or spoke with CEOs of defense contractors, industrial companies and a plethora of auto makers as part of his effort to diversify Qualcomm's customer base away from phone chips. He reached a deal with French car maker Renault SA to put Qualcomm chips in a coming electric car.
When he took over, people advised against pinning himself too early to a long-term strategy, he said. But he decided to present a detailed five-year plan to all of Qualcomm's employees anyway during a three-hour presentation this summer. He wanted employees to find motivation in knowing how their work aligned with the company's goals.
The thinking behind Qualcomm's auto-industry push is that more car makers now use semiconductors in their dashboard displays, driver-assistance features and other applications.
That strategy produced the biggest surprise of Mr. Amon's young tenure as CEO -- a multibillion-dollar takeover bid for an auto-technology company that makes sensors allowing computers to take a greater role in driving. It had to snatch the company, Sweden's Veoneer Inc., from a competing bidder.
Qualcomm already had a partnership with Veoneer to work on self-driving systems, but Veoneer's management wanted a buyer that would give it enough scale to compete with the likes of Tesla Inc. and Intel Corp.'s driving-tech subsidiary, Mobileye. When Canadian automotive company Magna International Inc. made a $3.8 billion cash offer to acquire Veoneer in July, it threatened Qualcomm's self-driving strategy.
Mr. Amon first sought to buy out Veoneer's share of the self-driving partnership for $2 billion, and then sweetened the offer to $2.5 billion in July. Veoneer's CEO instead asked that Qualcomm bid for the whole company. In August, Mr. Amon offered $4.6 billion, and this month the Swedish company accepted the bid, which Qualcomm made in partnership with an investment firm.
The deal made for a hectic beginning to Mr. Amon's tenure as CEO. The one thing Mr. Amon laments about his first few months is how little time he has. ""I have a shortage of chips and a shortage of time,"" he said. ""We're in a hurry. We have a lot of things to do. We have to diversify and reposition Qualcomm and there's not a lot of time.""

909,"(BPT) - If you’re a millennial, the chances you’ve already invested in a private life insurance policy are probably pretty low. The share of Americans covered by life insurance slid from 63% in 2011 to 52% in 2021 — and the most pronounced decrease has come from younger generations.
It makes sense — you’re young and healthy, and extra money goes towards the latest iPhone, smart home device or international travel. With the last 18 months forcing even younger generations to confront their own mortality, 48% of millennials are reportedly planning to buy within the next 12 months.
Here’s why now is the time for millennials to prioritize life insurance:
1. Save money over time.
For all the stereotypes about millennials, it’s a generation of good planners who are responsible and strong forward-thinkers. The cost of a life insurance policy is largely dependent upon risk (healthy millennials are generally considered a lower risk), so buying a life insurance policy when you are young can help lock in lower rates with term or permanent insurance.
2. Buying life insurance is easier.
One of the main reasons millennials have avoided life insurance is because it has traditionally been a pain to buy. Fortunately, advances in technology have made it easier to purchase almost anything. Millennials use virtual assistants or e-commerce sites to shop for groceries and order takeout. Same-day delivery is no longer a perk, but an industry standard that even the life insurance industry is beginning to embrace.
Signing up for life insurance isn’t difficult now that there are streamlined processes like the Quility direct-to-consumer platform, which allows applicants to receive a personalized policy up to $1 million approved and delivered on average in ten minutes or less — no doctor’s visits or in-person meetings necessary. The 100% online platform, which recently added two new term life products, including the brand’s proprietary Quility Level Term product, is the new industry standard in simplicity, convenience and affordability. The company also has licensed insurance agents available for in-person, virtual or telephone meetings.
3. Protect your family from financial burden.
Millennials have long prioritized their careers and financial security but, as even the youngest millennials enter their mid-20s, more and more are starting families.
It has become commonplace for people to believe they don’t need life insurance because they don’t have any children yet. But just because you don’t have dependents doesn’t mean there aren’t people who depend on you. Life insurance will help protect your spouse or long-term significant other with whom you own or rent a home, and allows your parents or siblings to cover unanticipated costs as they grieve.
Half of millennials acknowledge their families would face financial hardship should a wage-earner die unexpectedly — and 43% expressed concern about leaving their dependents in a difficult financial bind. That’s especially important for millennials who have long prioritized their careers and financial security, but are now looking to start families as even the youngest of the generation enter their mid-20s.
4. Consider your cosigners.
Today’s graduates are strapped with record-breaking student loan debt, so it’s important for millennials to consider their cosigners when shopping for life insurance.
Certain types of debt are waived in the event of an unexpected death — and that includes student loans. However, many millennials have their parents or loved ones cosign on loans, credit cards or mortgages. If that’s the case, your student loan debt would transfer to your cosigner in the event of an unexpected death. A life insurance policy would help ease that financial burden in a time of grieving.
Millennials are among the most educated and knowledgeable generations in history. They’re health conscious, financially conscious and socially conscious. Yet, life insurance has been overlooked because the industry has made things too complex, too confusing and too inconvenient.
COVID has raised awareness about the important role life insurance plays in families’ financial security, so it’s time for millennials to consider getting life insurance sooner rather than later.

910,"PHILADELPHIA — Ben Simmons' first trip to Philadelphia since being traded Feb. 10 added a tangible element to Thursday night's 76ers-Nets game.
Though Simmons didn't play due to ""return to competition reconditioning/back soreness,"" the embattled former Sixer's presence on the Brooklyn bench resulted in repeated loud boos and vulgar chants by the sold-out Philly crowd, as well as a healthy contingent of national media, for the Nets' convincing 129-100 victory at the Wells Fargo Center.
By the middle of the third quarter, with the Sixers trailing by 29 points on the way to a 36-point deficit, the fans were booing the home team instead of Simmons. The only time they bothered with Simmons in the second half was in the fourth period when Simmons left his seat to retrieve a loose ball.
The fans' anger directed at Simmons, who asked to be traded in the wake of the Sixers' second-round playoff loss to the Hawks and has yet to play this season, helped turn what would've been a relatively normal mid-March contest into something akin to a playoff atmosphere.
Perhaps the Simmons saga, coupled with James Harden going from the Nets to the Sixers and other storylines, could make this a full-fledged rivalry.
If the season ended Friday, the 40-25 Sixers would hold the third seed in the Eastern Conference. They are one game behind the second-place Bucks with 17 remaining. The 34-33 Nets are eighth, but could end up No. 7 if they win the play-in tournament for seeds No. 7-10, which would mean an opening-round series against the No. 2 seed.
Imagine former MVP Kevin Durant, perennial all-star Kyrie Irving and perhaps Simmons, the 2020-21 runner-up NBA Defensive Player of the Year, facing former MVP Harden, 2020-21 MVP runner-up Joel Embiid and emerging guard Tyrese Maxey in a best-of-seven set.
Simmons could defend Harden, with Maxey matching up with Irving and Sixers' defensive specialist Matisse Thybulle trying to limit lengthy scoring machine Durant. Harden would return to Brooklyn for the first time since he requested a trade, so the Nets' fans would get to express their disdain for him. And, if all goes well, Simmons would be back on the court.
Talk about drama ...
""Let's make it one (a rivalry),"" said Sixers coach Doc Rivers beforehand. ""Both of us want to get the same thing, right? We have the exact same goal. I think Brooklyn wants to win the world championship and so do the Sixers. At some point, if that's true, we're probably going to have to go through each other. That's just facts.""
That the unvaccinated Irving can only play in non-New York games, due to the city's COVID-19 mandate, complicates the injury-plagued Nets' task, but it's a possibility. Since Irving is only available in away games, Brooklyn would be better off finishing eighth than seventh because it'd mean a road date with Irving vs. the No. 7 seed.
""It's not really my expertise to define what a rivalry is, but hopefully we can develop one,"" said Brooklyn coach Steve Nash. ""It'd be great. It'd be great to play meaningful games more often.""
Asked what would make this a rivalry, Rivers replied, ""I think if we played in the playoffs and we won."" Plenty of laughter ensued.
Since 1984, the franchises have only met once in the postseason — the Sixers' first-round victory in 2019.
Thursday's intensity ramped up late in the first quarter when Embiid bowled over Durant, only for Durant to be called for the foul. As Embiid waited to shoot free throws, Durant slapped his chest and yapped at Embiid, with Embiid talking back at Durant.
Harden struggled through a 3-for-17 performance and the Nets' plethora of shot-makers made it a difficult night for the Sixers. Durant, as usual, was virtually unstoppable with 25 points on 10-for-17 shooting, 14 rebounds and 7 assists.
Durant took a shot at Sixers' fans afterward and didn't miss that either, saying, ""It was a good environment to start. It didn't finish that way.""
""Tonight was good for us, man,"" Harden insisted. ""We got our (butt) kicked. Since I've been here, everything has been sweet and we've been winning games (5-0 with Harden before Thursday). We get an opportunity to come down to reality.""
Even with Thursday's one-sided result, these two clubs squaring off in the postseason would be terrific theater.
""I don't know what a rivalry is, honestly,"" Rivers said. ""I know the Red Sox and Yankees — that's a rivalry. Duke (and) North Carolina — I'm positive that's a rivalry. Philadelphia and Boston from years ago, that's a rivalry. ... I think times played in history is what creates a rivalry.""
The Sixers and Nets aren't there, yet. But it'd be pretty cool if Thursday helped talented teams from cities less than 100 miles apart take another step toward developing into one.

OVERVIEW OF Q2 REVENUE  REVENUE BY TYPE   Advertising revenue grew 24% year-over-year, driven by CBS’ broadcasts of 2021 sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts in the prior-year period as a result of COVID-19, and an improved advertising market.   Affiliate revenue increased 9% year-over-year, reflecting expanded distribution and higher reverse compensation and retransmission fees.   Streaming revenue rose 92% year-over-year:   Streaming advertising revenue more than doubled, growing 102% year-over-year, driven by growth in advertising on Pluto TV, Paramount+ and other digital video platforms.   Streaming subscription revenue grew 82% year-over-year, reflecting strong subscriber growth across the company’s subscription services.     Theatrical revenue reflects the release of A Quiet Place Part II in the second quarter of 2021, while there were no releases in the prior-year period as a result of COVID-19.   Licensing and other revenue decreased 36% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to South Park in the prior year and the impact on film licensing from the absence of theatrical releases throughout most of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 due to COVID-19.    $ IN MILLIONS   Three Months Ended June 30   Six Months Ended June 30      2021      2020     $ B/(W) %    2021      2020     $ B/(W) %   Advertising*   $  2,097     $  1,686     $  411      24    %     $  4,778     $  3,905     $  873      22    %     Affiliate*    2,107      1,929      178      9      4,182      3,897      285      7     Streaming    983      513      470      92      1,799      1,007      792      79     Advertising    502      248      254      102      930      513      417      81     Subscription    481      265      216      82      869      494      375      76     Theatrical    134      3      131      n/m        135      170      (35    )      (21    )     Licensing and other    1,243      1,944      (701    )      (36    )      3,082      3,595      (513    )      (14    )     Total Revenue   $  6,564     $  6,075     $  489      8    %     $  13,976     $  12,574     $  1,402      11    %                         *Excludes streaming revenue n/m = not meaningful   GLOBAL STREAMING HIGHLIGHTS   Global streaming subscribers rose to more than 42M, adding 6.5M subscribers in the quarter.

Streaming revenue rose 81% year-over-year, reflecting subscriber growth at Paramount+, as well as advertising growth from Paramount+ and other digital video platforms.   Licensing and other revenue increased 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by a higher volume of programming licensed internationally and produced for third-party broadcasters.     Adjusted OIBDA decreased 45% year-over-year, reflecting the company’s increased investment in Paramount+.    $ IN MILLIONS   Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30      2021    2020   $ B/(W) %  2021    2020   $ B/(W) %   Revenue   $  2,809   $  2,287   $  522    23    %   $  6,320   $  5,234   $  1,086    21    %     Advertising*    1,088    880    208    24    2,895    2,168    727    34     Affiliate*    691    629    62    10    1,384    1,252    132    11     Streaming    350    193    157    81    672    397    275    69     Licensing and other    680    585    95    16    1,369    1,417    (48    )    (3    )     Expenses    2,593    1,895    (698    )    (37    )    5,655    4,269    (1,386    )    (32    )     Adjusted OIBDA   $  216   $  392   $  (176    )    (45    )%   $  665   $  965   $  (300    )    (31    )%           *Excludes streaming revenue   CABLE NETWORKS   In Q2, ViacomCBS had the most programs among the top 25 original cable series with P18-34 and P2-11 than any other cable family.   Revenue increased 8% year-over-year, primarily driven by higher streaming, advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by lower licensing revenue.   Advertising revenue increased 24% year-over-year, largely driven by an improved advertising market and a 4-percentage point favorable impact of foreign exchange rate changes, partially offset by lower ratings.   Affiliate revenue grew 9% year-over-year, reflecting expanded vMVPD distribution and rate increases, partially offset by subscriber declines.   Streaming revenue increased 98% year-over-year, largely fueled by advertising revenue growth from Pluto TV, as well as growth in subscribers for subscription streaming services, including SHOWTIME OTT and BET+.   Licensing and other revenue decreased 48% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to South Park in the prior-year quarter, partially offset by revenue from the licensing of programming to Paramount+.     Adjusted OIBDA declined 12% year-over-year, reflecting the benefit to 2020 from the domestic licensing of South Park and an increased investment in content, partially offset by the above-mentioned revenue increases.    $ IN MILLIONS   Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30      2021    2020   $ B/(W) %  2021    2020   $ B/(W) %   Revenue   $  3,475   $  3,232   $  243    8    %   $  6,734   $  6,090   $  644    11    %     Advertising*    1,011    815    196    24    1,889    1,760    129    7     Affiliate*    1,416    1,300    116    9    2,798    2,645    153    6     Streaming    633    320    313    98    1,127    610    517    85     Licensing and other    415    797    (382    )    (48    )    920    1,075    (155    )    (14    )     Expenses    2,350    1,947    (403    )    (21    )    4,425    4,011    (414    )    (10    )     Adjusted OIBDA   $  1,125   $  1,285   $  (160    )    (12    )%   $  2,309   $  2,079   $  230    11    %                 *Excludes streaming revenue   FILMED ENTERTAINMENT   Revenue grew 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by current quarter theatrical releases, partially offset by lower licensing revenue.   Theatrical revenue reflects the release of A Quiet Place Part II.   Licensing and other revenue decreased 17% year-over-year because of lower home entertainment revenue as a result of the absence of theatrical releases due to COVID-19.     Adjusted OIBDA declined 38% year-over-year, reflecting distribution costs associated with current quarter theatrical releases and other anticipated releases later in 2021.    $ IN MILLIONS   Three Months Ended June 30 Six Months Ended June 30      2021    2020   $ B/(W) %  2021    2020   $ B/(W) %   Revenue   $  667   $  647   $  20    3    %   $  1,664   $  1,458   $  206    14    %     Theatrical    134    3    131    n/m       135    170    (35    )    (21    )     Licensing and other    533    644    (111    )    (17    )    1,529    1,288    241    19     Expenses    595    531    (64    )    (12    )    1,388    1,315    (73    )    (6    )     Adjusted OIBDA   $  72   $  116   $  (44    )    (38    )%   $  276   $  143   $  133    93    %           n/m = not meaningful     BALANCE SHEET & LIQUIDITY    As of June 30, 2021, the company had $5.4B of cash on its balance sheet and a committed $3.5B revolving credit facility that remains undrawn.

Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted OIBDA”), adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.  Because the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision/benefit for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.  The following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.

912,"Mar. 28Hey, everyone!!!
It's Sunday afternoon in San Antonio. I've walked a ton the last two days, about 12,500 steps on Friday  probably 5,000 in the wrong direction  and about 13,000 Saturday. On Friday, I gave walking to the Alamodome from my hotel (about a mile) a trial run. I decided that in order to avoid starting my Saturday game day sweaty and stressed from walking a mile in dress shoes with my laptop, I would call an Uber. So wouldn't you know it, the Uber driver got lost, causing me to start the day sweaty and stressed anyway.
There were about 20 reporters covering UConn's noon game against Iowa on the North Court at the Alamodome. In order to keep us away from the players due to COVID-19 protocols, we are sitting up on the concourse, each with our own table. I had my own lamp!
UConn played great, with a 92-72 victory over the Hawkeyes. Both freshmen that were in the spotlight entering the game, UConn All-American Paige Bueckers and Iowa's Caitlin Clark, who leads the country in scoring, played well enough, but the game belonged to UConn's Christyn Williams both offensively and defensively. I always feel a little bit badly when people question Williams about her ""ups and downs"" at UConn, asking her about what she terms her worst day, when UConn coach Geno Auriemma once called her ""uncoachable."" Geno explained Saturday that he likely has called all of his players uncoachable at one time or another. ""A lot of words come out of my mouth,"" he said. Williams just happened to take it more personally than most. She handled the line of questioning like a pro, however, like she always does.
I made a trip to my second San Antonio landmark, after which the four women's NCAA tournament regions are named. UConn is competing in the River Walk Region. The River Walk is a 15-mile urban waterway which runs through the heart of the city, below street level, and is lined with restaurants, bars and shops. My memory from last time UConn played here is that the River Walk is narrow and not my favorite place for a stroll, but I decided to revisit it. The fact I did so on a Saturday night meant throngs of people, however, many of whom who were a few margaritas in. So think of the River Walk as its own version of New Orleans, only with the possibly of being knocked in the river. Haha.
This morning, the NCAA's virtual press conferences for teams playing Monday began at 9 a.m. We talked to Geno and junior Olivia Nelson-Ododa from UConn and coach Kim Mulkey and senior Moon Ursin from Baylor, the consensus being this game has the feel of a national championship matchup. No one is quite sure how Baylor, which is 28-2, ended up with a No. 2 seed.
In any case, No. 1 UConn faces No. 2 Baylor on Monday for a berth in the Final Four, which would make UConn's unprecedented 13th straight trip to the Final Four. Hope you're watching!
Best, Vickie

914,"Powered by his legs and lungs, and to no lesser degree the memory of his slain son, Ian Hockley on Saturday will run through the darkness and sunlight of Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Connecticut as part of a three-man team covering 95 miles over about 14 hours.
From the time Hockley’s group lines up at 4 a.m. for the start of the RiMaConn Relay at Blackstone River State Park in Lincoln, R.I., to the time his “Beer Witch Project” team finishes at Riverfront Plaza in Hartford around 6 p.m., he will pull the unique cooperation of physical and emotional extremes through seemingly endless tree-lined trails.

“It’s a very intense shared experience,” Hockley said. “We call it running for Dylan. There’s that emotional content, and just the exhaustion, the exhilaration — all rolled in.”
Hockley’s son, Dylan, was one of 26 victims, 20 of them first-grade students, killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook School shooting in Newtown. He was 6 years old, a little boy who struggled with speech development and was autistic, yet a charismatic force in discovering ways to express himself.
“When Dylan would get excited, really overstimulated, he would jump up and down and flap his hands,” Ian Hockley said. “That’s how he got that out of his system. His mom asked him one day, ‘Dylan, why do you flap?’ And she wasn’t sure he was going to answer. But he said, ‘Mummy, I’m a beautiful butterfly.’”
The memory of that exchange, and Dylan’s general appreciation for simply joys that tend to leave the world in a better place one interaction at a time, inspired a powerful movement that took hold shortly after his death.
That movement has sustained through the actions of “Dylan’s Wings Of Change,” a nonprofit foundation that promotes positive relationships among peers.
The initial incentive for the foundation, established months after Dylan’s death as a way to harness and redirected monetary donations, was to assist students with special needs. It became something more expansive, touching the lives of young students with programs that promote empathy and positive, supportive relationships. More than 50 schools have been involved, many of them in Connecticut, and thousands of students.
The Hockleys, including Ian’s ex-wife Nicole, told the story of Dylan’s flapping during their son’s memorial and numerous times in various settings afterward. Someone responded with a story about the butterfly being a symbol of change, sparking a movement.
“The caterpillar goes through amazing transformation, comes out as this fragile, yet resilient, beautiful thing,” Ian Hockley said. “There’s also the butterfly effect. In chaos theory, small changes accumulate and have a massive impact. The butterfly flapping its wings can cause a hurricane on the other side of the world. You only need to create small change. If there are other people that are with you, like-minded — What if we decided to pick each other up, not put each other down? Think of the ripples that spread out from those decisions.”
The Hockleys’ life was torn apart on Dec. 14, 2012. But if ever there was evidence of something so fragile becoming so resilient, so beautiful … it is the way they have spun unimaginable heartbreak into way to unlock powers of the human spirit.
Hockley’s job with IBM led to the family’s move to Connecticut from England in 2011. He later left the company to run Dylan’s Wings Of Change full-time but went back to work in finance management during the pandemic, as the foundation’s events and fundraising were all but eliminated. He remains the foundation’s executive director.
Hockley, a motivational speaker who has teamed with high-profile groups and politicians, is one of the more visible members of the Sandy Hook community. Nicole Hockley has been equally active in leading conversation about gun violence, and she is on the Dylan’s Wings Of Change advisory board. Nicole is also the co-founder of Sandy Hook Promise, a violence prevention foundation.
Dylan’s Wings Of Change stresses the importance of one child being the next child’s wingman — as Jake Hockley, now entering his senior year at Newtown High, was to his younger brother Dylan. Among the programs developed by the foundation are Wingman Youth Leadership, Wingman Educator and Camp Wings of Friendship.
“Everything we do celebrates his life,” Ian Hockley said of Dylan. “It’s very uplifting to speak about his life, although it was short, and to help people draw some inspiration from my journey and his memory, to take a moment and pause and think about those people around them and their connection, what they can do to make someone else’s life better. He was struggling with communication, but he could connect you with on an emotional level to make you happy. He loved to laugh. Just … that purity.”
That innocence. Taken. Jake Hockley was in third grade when his brother was killed. He is about to enter his senior year at Newtown High, a tennis player who recently decided to go out for the football team. He has begun looking at colleges.
“He’s becoming the young man that the years of the impact of the tragedy stole because the middle school years were tough,” Ian Hockley said. “Dylan adored Jake. For a little boy who was struggling — autism could make it difficult to relate to other people or just navigate the world — so Jake was Dylan’s wingman. He could look to him and know this was a safe situation, or a fun situation. We have a lot of photos of the two of them together. They have very similar laughs.”

Running events have become a major arm of the foundation’s fundraising and camaraderie, with the Beer Witch Project and its scores of members having raced all over New England, in Germany and in England.
The Beer Witch Project name stems from the group’s love for beer — and recognizes of that eerie feeling for a runner seeing no other headlamps in the woods, wondering if they’re lost. The team has four entries of three-runner teams in the RiMaConn Relay, which was canceled last year due to the pandemic.
The race is broken up into 18 legs. The other runners with Hockley are Bob Burbank of Newtown and Mark Katz of Milford. The driver, Jennifer Heitzke, is Ian’s girlfriend. She is responsible for transporting the two inactive runners to the next checkpoint.
“COVID was difficult,” Hockley said. “But we’re back.”
This is all about coming back, really, about seeing the country and the world, making and keeping friends, promoting a good cause — and honoring the memory of a little boy, making sure the positive impact he had on a family and a community can be felt each time his father runs or speaks. Just a week after Dylan’s death, when Hockley delivered his son’s eulogy, he wanted to spread hope, positivity.
“This terrible thing had happened — and who thought it would come to a sleepy Connecticut town?” Ian said. “But it can happen anywhere. So we didn’t want people to lose hope, especially in our community, that we’re still here and prepared to go on.”
Hockley and his family, and so many others, have lived through a uniquely horrifying experience. He still keeps in touch with several Sandy Hook families. The 2019 suicide of Jeremy Richman, the father of 6-year-old Sandy Hook victim, Avielle, “was a reminder that this tragedy will never go away and continues to have an impact,” Hockley said. Hockey and Richman were dear friends.
The nine-year anniversary of the Sandy Hook shooting is Dec. 14.
“Every day is different,” Ian said. “I am doing well. Events like this, begin part of Dylan’s Wings Of Change, it’s an honor. That gives me energy. And things that give you energy are so important now because of the things in life that are sapping our energy. The pandemic is sapping everyone’s energy. Life is just a little bit harder.
“We’ve all lost someone. That’s an empathetic connection that everybody can relate to. And it might have been — if there’s ever a good way to lose someone, like peacefully, and you get to say goodbye — or tragically and horrifically. But the loss is still the same. I’ve heard grief described as love with nowhere to go. It just takes a lot of time to repurpose that love and to be able to do good with it, if you can. So I’m good. I’m blessed. I’m privileged.”

917,"(TNSRes) -- The University of Hong Kong issued the following news release:With the generous support of Fok Ying Tung Foundation, LKS Faculty of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong (HKUMed) is launching a real-time community surveillance initiative to assess and monitor the underlying epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 infection during the ongoing fifth wave of Omicron BA.2.A total of 10,000 participants will be recruited from HKUMed's several large-scale longrunning cohorts and ongoing studies (e.g. FAMILY cohort, Children of 1997 Birth Cohort, Elderly Health Services Cohort, Flu in family cohort, serological surveys) currently maintained by the School of Public Health, also supplemented by randomly drawn samples from all 18 districts around Hong Kong.The current fifth wave has led to unprecedented disruption to societal functioning and imposed a massive care burden to the health system. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, whether by self-provided deep throat saliva samples or professionally administered swabbed samples, suffer from three major shortcomings rendering the reliability of reported case counts as being an accurate reflection of the real epidemic trajectory in some doubt.First, there is ongoing supply constraint of total testing capacity. Second, those presenting for PCR testing is increasingly a biased population due to recent frequent changes to the issuance of restriction testing declarations (RTDs), compulsory testing notices (CTNs), as well as population behavioural adaptation to the consequences of the possibility of a positive result. Third, population behavioural change has been compounded by the increasingly easy availability of rapid antigen tests (RATs). Finally, with widespread circulation of the virus, the previously indicative sewage surveillance signal is no longer useful in tracking epidemic trajectory.It is however more critical than ever to maintain reliable surveillance of (at least relative) epidemic growth or decline, in order to provide real time input into policy decisions.The community surveillance initiative will commence as soon as possible for a continuous period of 12 weeks in the first instance. RATs and lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) for SAR-CoV-2 antibodies will be provided to all participants, who will carry out RATs on a weekly basis with self-sampled combined throat and nasal swab, and LFIAs with a drop of capillary blood sampled by self-finger prick on a monthly basis. Parents may collect samples for their children. All testing results will be reported through an online reporting platform of the real-time surveillance system. The data collected will be robustly prosecuted, enabling researchers to estimate how quickly the virus is spreading in the community, and to estimate the proportion of the people having antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in real-time among the local population, due either to vaccination or prior infection with the virus. These data streams will enable researchers to provide an unbiased assessment of the underlying epidemic dynamics, on which basis epidemic control decisions are to be made.'We are most grateful to the Fok Ying Tung Foundation for making the community surveillance initiative possible, which will provide real-time data for continuous monitoring of epidemic dynamics of the ongoing fifth wave. This will be invaluable for decision making,' said Professor Gabriel Leung, Dean of Medicine, The University of Hong Kong, Helen and Francis Zimmern Professor in Population Health, and Chair Professor of Public Health Medicine, HKUMed.MSTRUCK-7753190 T40-MgEditor",University of Hong Kong Launches Real-Time Community Surveillance Initiative With Generous Support by Fok Ying Tung Foundation

DanceBlue 2022 is taking place on March 5 and 6. DanceBlue is a student-run organization that raises money for the Golden Matrix Fund, which supports kids at the DanceBlue Kentucky Children’s Hospital Hematology/Oncology Clinic.
DanceBlue works year-round to fundraise, although the main event is this Saturday and Sunday. A 24-hour, no sitting, no sleeping dance marathon brings hundreds of participants to Memorial Coliseum, running from 8 p.m. Saturday to 8 p.m. Sunday. 
The organization began raising money in 2006. Since then, DanceBlue has raised over $18 million for the Golden Matrix Fund. 
DanceBlue was created in support of a boy named Jarrett Mynear. He was diagnosed with a rare bone cancer at age 2 and with various other forms of cancer six times by the time he was 14. Despite being sick, Jarrett was smart, personable and positive. Before he passed away in 2002, he created a list of requests. One of those was to raise funds to improve the Pediatric Oncology Outpatient Clinic at Kentucky Children’s Hospital. 
In its first year, DanceBlue raised $123,323.16, making it one of the fastest- growing dance marathons in the United States. 
This year, the dance marathon will be happening in person. Due to COVID-19, DanceBlue was held virtually in 2021. Despite the setback, DanceBlue still raised $1,011,115.49. 
Because of the pandemic, spectators will only be allowed from 5-8 p.m. on Sunday, March 6. All attendees will be required to wear masks. 
“The heart of our mission is to establish a community of care for families facing one of the hardest times in their lives,” said Millie Malek, the DanceBlue 2022 Family Relations Chair,  in an interview with UKnow. “A critical factor in creating and maintaining this community is doing our best to ensure the safety of the kids, families, and staff that we aim to support.”
In order to participate, students can become a dancer, volunteer or donate to DanceBlue. For more information, visit danceblue.org.

919,"The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, and Homeland Security issued the following testimony by Dallas Police Chief Edgardo 'Eddie' Garcia, on behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, involving a hearing on March 8, 2022, entitled ""Reimagining Public Safety in the COVID-19 Era"":* * *In addition to being Chief of the Dallas Police Department, I also am here on behalf of the Major Cities Chiefs Association (MCCA). The MCCA is a professional organization of police executives representing the 79 largest cities in the United States and Canada. The Association's mission is to provide a forum for police executives from large population centers to address the challenges and issues of policing, influence national and international policy that affects police services, enhance the development of current and future police leaders, and encourage and sponsor research that advances this mission.This hearing will focus on reimagining public safety in the COVID-19 era. These efforts must not come at the expense of law enforcement, especially considering how the scourge of violent crime is plaguing communities across the country. While MCCA members are constantly developing new and innovative approaches to public safety, it will be difficult to bring about sustainable change if the public continues to be victimized by unprecedented levels of gun violence, carjackings, and other violent crime.My testimony will provide an on-the-ground, local law enforcement perspective on what is driving the current violent crime situation in America's urban centers. More specifically, I will discuss how all federal, state, and local stakeholders can work together to address these challenges and institute meaningful public safety reform.Policing ReformThe MCCA is a leader in national policy debates on policing reform. The Association established a Police Reform Working Group in October 2020 and, in January 2021, released a comprehensive report that addressed the use of force, training, data collection and reporting, independent investigations, accreditation standards, and no-knock warrants, amongst other topics.The MCCA has consistently called for an approach to reform that is evidence-based, sustainable, and thoughtful. Every day, MCCA members work to protect and serve their communities while implementing professional law enforcement practices that are fair, equitable, transparent, and procedurally just. Furthermore, the MCCA remains steadfast in its commitment to help increase accountability and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities we serve.As Congress and the Administration continues efforts to advance policing reform, they must avoid trying to ""nationalize law enforcement."" While reform should revolve around some general principles, every community is different, and the specific policies or initiatives that work in one community may not work in another. As such, local police departments must have sufficient flexibility to put forth reforms that account for the unique needs of their communities.Law enforcement is entrusted with a solemn responsibility that must be taken seriously. From academy recruits to the chief, we must hold ourselves to the highest standards and have zero tolerance for any action that jeopardizes public safety or violates the trust of the communities we serve. When these standards are breached, it casts a shadow over the hundreds of thousands of officers who put on their uniforms every day to serve their fellow citizens and keep their communities safe. As law enforcement executives, MCCA members must ensure that if misconduct occurs, it is dealt with decisively, and the individuals responsible are held accountable.Here are a few examples of steps we've taken in Dallas to promote accountability throughout the department and build trust with the community. The Dallas Police Department has implemented an early warning system that takes a data-driven approach to notify police leadership of officers who display signs of conduct that may require further attention. Once these officers are identified, we can conduct further evaluations and provide the officer with the support needed to mitigate potential future issues. This system allows us to address any concerns on the front end before it results in action that either poses a risk to community members or diminishes the reputation of the police department.Dallas PD utilizes a Police Use of Force system that examines how and why officers use force and provides a holistic view to help identify both high risk and exemplary behavior. This system includes an evaluation tool that allows us to measure the effectiveness of policies and training and assess the impacts of any implemented reforms. Dashboards included in the system can also be made public, and this data provides a detailed look into the use of force practices. The Police Use of Force systems improves police-community relations by educating the community and providing detailed and accurate information on policing practices. This transparency, in turn, promotes mutual trust and respect.Law enforcement must continue to work tirelessly to build strong relationships with the community. It is much easier to navigate a crisis and bring about change when the public trusts law enforcement and knows their concerns will be taken seriously. For this reason, MCCA members are strong proponents of community and relational policing. Fruitful community engagement is dependent on being present. I consider myself a ""blue-collar chief,"" and I routinely go out on patrol with my officers. One of many benefits is that these patrols allow me to interact with and hear directly from community members outside of the more traditional law enforcementcommunity engagement avenues.All Dallas police recruits now undergo instruction on the history of policing. This course aims to arm incoming officers with a more solid foundation as it relates to the history of the profession and how it has shaped police work today. This knowledge is important since history of any kind often repeats itself if not fully understood and appreciated. Moreover, firmly understanding our past can and should better inform our pathway forward to a more successful and brighter future in policing. Dallas PD partners with the University of North Texas to provide this training, and thus far, three recruiting classes have completed the course.As work on policing reform continues, all stakeholders, including elected officials, must push back on calls to defund the police. Defunding can have disastrous consequences and hurt the communities most in need. The reality is that communities in major cities, especially those most impacted by the increase in violent crime, don't want fewer police in their communities. I have not met a neighborhood impacted by violent crime in Dallas, regardless of language spoken, racial makeup, or socio-economic status, that has ever asked me for less police. As President Biden said in his State of the Union address, ""We should all agree: the answer is not to defund the police. The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities.""/1Finally, we must appropriately balance reform with crime-fighting efforts, given the ongoing rise in violent crime. We cannot create a situation where reforms make it impossible for officers to do their jobs. Nor can we put restrictions in place that prevent law enforcement from taking the proactive action that is instrumental in decreasing violent crime. Reform and public safety are not mutually exclusive.The Rise in Violent CrimeThe sustained increase in violent crime is disproportionately impacting MCCA members. The brave officers in these cities have continued to work tirelessly to tackle this challenge head-on to keep our communities safe. However, more must be done to support them, crime victims, and impacted communities.According to the latest MCCA Violent Crime Survey, there were 9,548 homicides in major cities in 2021, a roughly 6% increase from 2020. However, when comparing homicide numbers over the past few years, the data clearly shows that America is in the middle of a violent crime wave. For example, in 2021, homicides were up approximately 49% compared to 2019 and 53% compared to 2018. These numbers are devastating and illuminate the unprecedented challenges local law enforcement has had to contend with over the past few years./2Dallas Violent Crime Reduction PlanDallas is unique in the fact that we are one of the few major cities where violent crime decreased last year. This trend has continued into 2022, and our violent crime thus far is down roughly 17% year to date. This would not be possible without the exemplary work of the officers and staff of the Dallas Police Department. I'd like to take a moment and use this platform to publicly thank them for the incredible work they do every day to keep our city safe.Following my appointment to serve as the Chief of Police in February 2021, my team and I developed a Violent Crime Reduction Plan. The plan relies heavily on science and crime data and was developed in conjunction with criminologists. It includes short-term, mid-term, and longerterm strategies to reduce violent crime, and Dallas PD began implementing the plan in May 2021.Given the success of this plan thus far, I believe it serves as a blueprint for how we can reimagine public safety in a way that properly balances enforcement and accountability, the provision of social services, community-based alternatives, and other initiatives to break to cycle of violence.The short-term strategies in the plan focus on hot spots policing. We broke the city of Dallas down into microgrids and focused on the roughly 50 grids responsible for 10% of all violent crime in the city. Based on crime analysis and mapping, DPD deployed a highly visible police presence to these grids at the times when violence is most often reported. In addition, DPD teams focused on surveilling, deterring, and arresting repeat violent offenders on other high-crime grids. These hot spots are reviewed and adjusted as needed every 90 days. This approach has been successful, and the mix of engagement and enforcement has driven down violent crime in these grids by 50%.The plan's mid-term strategies consist of Place Network Investigations. These consist of a variety of government agencies, non-profit and community-based groups, and other stakeholders working together to address crime and drivers of crime in a given location. Place Network Investigations combine traditional law enforcement efforts with code enforcement, abatement, environmental design changes, and other actions. By strengthening the neighborhood and reinvesting in the community, these strategies seek to alter a location's criminogenic nature.The longer-term strategies included in the plan emphasize focused deterrence and urban blight abatement. Focused deterrence seeks to change the behavior of high-risk offenders through a combination of incapacitation, community involvement, and alternatives to violence. This consists of continued engagement between law enforcement and high-risk offenders, including providing these individuals with social services, education, and job training. Community violence interventions are also a key component of DPD's focused deterrence strategy. The police department will continue to work closely with other city agencies, non-profits and community groups, and other leaders in the community to implement this portion of the strategy.Part of the reason this plan has been so successful is the strong relationship between Dallas PD and our federal partners. We have a remarkable relationship with the FBI, DEA, ATF, and US Marshals offices in the city. We're in constant communication, and these agencies have molded their own operations to support Dallas PD's crime plan. Having Special Agents in Charge in our federal partners' field offices who prioritize supporting local law enforcement efforts to address violent crime is invaluable. I strongly encourage other local police departments to make sure you build relationships with the federal law enforcement leadership in your jurisdiction.I cannot emphasize enough that my fellow chiefs, regardless of the size of their department or jurisdiction, should look at the data and work closely with criminologists to develop a violent crime reduction plan that meets the unique needs of their community. These plans must properly mix community input, community engagement, and enforcement action focused on taking violent offenders off the street. Together, this will help drive down violent crime. Congress should consider providing additional grant funding or other assistance to help local law enforcement develop and implement violent crime reduction plans.Federal-Local Law Enforcement PartnershipsAs mentioned earlier, local and federal partnerships are crucial in addressing increases in violent crime. MCCA members enjoy close working relationships with their federal partners and frequently collaborate with them to address guns, gangs, and other threats via task forces and other joint efforts. These efforts have been successful and should be expanded. However, federal resources are limited, so Congress must provide these agencies with the requisite resources to ensure they're able to continue to provide this support. Furthermore, MCCA members have found programs that promote federal-local law enforcement collaboration to address violent crime, such as Project Safe Neighborhoods, to be valuable.Similarly, Congress must support efforts to build the capacity of US Attorney's Offices. There is either no permanent US Attorney or a lack of urgency to support local law enforcement efforts to fight violent crime in some jurisdictions. MCCA members have found pursuing federal charges for violent criminals to be a successful strategy, especially considering the challenges described above with local district attorneys. By increasing the capacity of US Attorney's Offices, we can increase federal prosecutions of violent criminals, which will serve as a powerful deterrent.Support for Law EnforcementOne of the most troubling recent violent crime trends is the rise in attacks on law enforcement officers. According to FBI data, 73 police officers were feloniously killed in 2021, a nearly 60% increase from 2020 and the highest total recorded in a decade./3In addition, another 25 officers have been shot and killed in 2022./4 MCCA member agencies have lost four officers in the line of duty thus far in 2022, and many others have been injured. The increase in violence directed towards law enforcement officers represents a complete disregard for the job officers do, the critical role they play in our communities, and the sanctity of life. Far too often, the perpetrators are violent offenders with lengthy criminal histories and previous felony convictions. In some incidents, the suspects were out on bond. The violence being directed towards police officers must stop immediately.In recent years, anti-law enforcement rhetoric and actions related to de-policing and defunding have left officers feeling vilified and negatively impacted morale in some law enforcement agencies. If officers don't feel supported, they may disengage from our communities. To address rising violent crime, we need officers to engage now more than ever, from both a proactive policing perspective and community engagement perspective.Law enforcement already has a tough job. When you combine that with these other challenges, it is clear why support for the law enforcement professional has never been more vital. Supporting law enforcement should not be political. Here in Dallas, the support of our mayor and city council have been an instrumental part of our efforts to reduce violent crime. The MCCA encourages elected officials at every level of government to follow suit, express their unequivocal support for law enforcement, and ensure officers have the necessary tools to keep our communities safe.Law Enforcement Staffing ChallengesLocal law enforcement agencies are facing a variety of staffing challenges, which have complicated the law enforcement response to violent crime. Law enforcement officers are frustrated by the current situation. Increases in violent crime, the failure of other elements in the criminal justice system to hold violent and repeat offenders accountable, and anti-police rhetoric have devastated officer morale. Police officers are retiring at an alarming rate, and many are leaving for smaller police departments. As a result, several MCCA member agencies are understaffed by hundreds of officers.MCCA members hold our officers to the highest standards and have stringent hiring criteria to ensure we employ unbiased, service-minded professionals. This can further shrink candidate pools and, in some instances, exacerbate existing recruitment and retention challenges.Understaffing has immensely impacted the day-to-day operations of law enforcement agencies.For example, some MCCA members have had to disband specialized units and can no longer conduct proactive policing to address violent crime. Call response times have increased in other agencies, and large portions of some workforces only have a few years of law enforcement experience.Understaffing has also created other staffing challenges, such as requiring officers to work mandatory overtime or canceling days off, leading to officer burnout. MCCA members are taking various approaches to try and address these challenges. Examples include offering signing and retention bonuses or increasing civilian hiring for administrative operations to ensure enough sworn officers are available to respond to calls for service.Continuity of leadership is another challenge. The average tenure of a major city police chief has decreased significantly, and the current turnover rate is unprecedented. Since January 2020, more than half of the MCCA's member agencies have experienced a change in leadership. This is detrimental to public safety overall, and frequent turnover can make it incredibly difficult to institute reform or change an organization's culture. As a result, law enforcement agencies must support leadership development efforts. These initiatives will help ensure interested and qualified officers have opportunities to rise through the ranks based on merit.Criminal Justice System AccountabilityPolice are just one component of the criminal justice system. The shortcomings of other elements in the system have produced a situation where violent and chronic offenders cycle through the criminal justice system. This undoubtedly contributes to the rise in violent crime, especially since these offenders continue to face no consequences for their actions. Our criminal justice system needs transparency, criminals need deterrents and accountability, and victims deserve justice.The challenges with the lack of accountability manifest themselves in several ways. In some cities, there is a reluctance on the part of district attorneys to prosecute certain crimes. This includes some violent and gun crimes, such as a felon in possession of a firearm. Other MCCA members have reported that district attorneys and judges are not following sentencing guidelines. Finally, probation supervision has decreased, and some parole officers are unwilling to act when offenders violate the terms of their release.Many areas throughout the country have implemented varying degrees of bail reform.Unfortunately, the impact of these policy changes is yet another example that highlights how a lack of accountability affects public safety. The MCCA strongly believes common-sense reform is needed to provide relief to non-violent offenders who pose a minimal risk to public safety. These individuals should not be held pre-trial simply because of their socio-economic status. However, some of these reform efforts have gone too far. As a result, in many major cities, violent offenders, including homicide suspects, and repeat offenders, are frequently released on either PR or very low bonds. The failure to remand these individuals allows them to continue to prey on our communities and contributes to cycles of retaliatory violence. There is a need for transparency throughout the criminal justice system so the American people can see how the actions of elected district attorneys and judges are impacting violent crime in their communities.Major cities across the country have also encountered a marked increase in the number of juveniles committing violent crimes, especially carjacking. This trend presents a unique set of challenges.As a society, we must do everything in our power to provide our youth with opportunities and resources. At the same time, repeat juvenile offenders, or those who commit serious, violent crimes must be held accountable. However, in many MCCA member jurisdictions, few of these juveniles face serious consequences. Instead, they are almost always released immediately instead of being placed in juvenile halls or other programs. As a result, there is no deterrent stopping other juveniles from engaging in similar or more dangerous behavior. The lack of accountability also leads juveniles to commit crimes they may not have otherwise. For example, MCCA members have indicated that gangs are pressuring juveniles to carry out shootings or having them hold older gang members' firearms. This is because even if these juveniles are caught, there likely won't be any consequences.The Dallas County District Attorney was elected on a reform and social justice platform. While we do not see eye to eye on everything, we have a good, open relationship. I truly believe that he does not turn a blind eye to violent crime. The District Attorney can do more to enforce some lower-level crimes, which may allow action to be taken before these offenders escalate to more serious offenses. Still, overall, I believe he'll hold people accountable. When we disagree, we can have a frank conversation about what happened and why. However, no matter what happens, I tell my officers that we need to focus on what we can control, and we won't let the police department be the broken part of the system. Dallas PD must continue to do its job, even if that means taking action against the same offenders multiple times.The situation in Dallas is not akin to other major cities. Some of my MCCA colleagues continue to experience significant challenges with judges and prosecutors in their jurisdiction. Make no mistake, the failure of the criminal justice system to hold violent offenders accountable drains law enforcement resources, hurts officer morale and the public's perception of law enforcement, and is detrimental to public safety and the rule of law. As a result, any effort to reimagine public safety must account for the entire criminal justice system, not just the police.Reopening the Courts and Addressing Case BacklogsMore must be done to fully reopen our judicial system. In many MCCA member jurisdictions, warrants are being signed, and people are being arrested, but suspected offenders are waiting months for a trial. The COVID-19 pandemic also exacerbated existing case backlogs in courts across the country. Congress should consider providing additional funding to address the shortage of prosecutors, defense attorneys, and courtrooms that have contributed to the current situation.The backlog in the courts is compounding the current violent crime situation. When coupled with the continued release of violent and repeat offenders pending trial, the long delay for a hearing increases the amount of time during which these individuals may continue to prey on the community or become victims of retaliatory violence. In some jurisdictions, due in part to case backlogs, district attorneys and judges are allowing violent offenders to plead down to less serious charges just to get cases moving.The Need for Additional ResourcesAddressing the various challenges highlighted throughout this testimony will require an influx of resources and a public commitment to support law enforcement. Police departments need assistance to address staffing shortages, enhance forensic and investigative capabilities, and provide services and support to victims of violent crime. Law enforcement also needs additional resources to support constitutional and procedurally just proactive policing efforts. These efforts will be critical in driving down violent crime. Unfortunately, proactive policing has become a luxury for many departments contending with high murder rates and low staffing.Developing and implementing the policies, training, and other changes needed to advance policing reform is costly. For example, a CBO analysis of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act found that implementing the provisions in that bill would cost law enforcement agencies ""several hundred million dollars annually.""/5Policing reform cannot become an unfunded mandate, especially since many local law enforcement budgets are already overburdened.The MCCA suggests that legislation or executive action on policing reform take an approach that is more carrot than stick. Relying on grant penalties to encourage compliance is not the most effective approach and may dissuade local police departments from applying for these grants.Further, the MCCA recommends that Congress provide new funding to support policing reform efforts. Adding more carveouts to existing grant programs chips away at the discretionary funding available to law enforcement agencies, which may hinder efforts to fight crime.Recently, the Administration has emphasized that state and local governments may use the funding provided in the American Rescue Plan to help address violent crime. Unfortunately, despite the Administration's guidance, officials in major cities have dedicated limited, if any, American Rescue Plan funding for law enforcement purposes. As such, the MCCA strongly encourages Congress to provide additional funding specifically for law enforcement and fully fund both COPS Hiring Grants and the Byrne JAG Program through the FY 2023 appropriations process.ConclusionLaw enforcement is currently in the midst of one of the most challenging periods in the history of our noble profession. Violent crime rates have steadily risen over the past few years. A lack of accountability has emboldened criminals, and brazen attacks on law enforcement officers have become disturbingly commonplace. At the same time, police departments continue to focus on building trust and increasing accountability, all while protecting our communities and offering the highest level of service possible. The goal of reimagining public safety should be building safe and prosperous communities. The success we've achieved in Dallas demonstrates how this is possible when investments are made, police officers are supported, and stakeholders work together.Thank you again for the opportunity to participate in today's hearing, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have.* * *Footnotes:1 ""Remarks of President Joe Biden - State of the Union Address As Prepared for Delivery,"" The White House, March 1, 2022. <https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/03/01/remarks-of-presidentjoebiden-state-of-the-union-address-as-delivered/>2 The MCCA's Violent Crime Reports can be found here: <https://majorcitieschiefs.com/resources/> 3 ""Law Enforcement Officer Deaths: 01/01/2021--12/31/2021"" Federal Bureau of Investigation, January 1, 2022. <https://crime-data-explorer.fr.cloud.gov/pages/le/leoka>4 ""Official Line-Of-Duty Fallen Heroes: January 2022 Report,"" National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, January 31, 2022. <https://twitter.com/NLEOMF/status/1488212238687256580> See also: ""Official Line-Of-Duty Fallen Heroes: February 2022 Report,"" National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund, February 28, 2022. <https://twitter.com/NLEOMF/status/1498404746553704448>5 ""Letter to the Honorable Jason Smith re: H.R. 1280, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act of 2021,"" Congressional Budget Office, March 9, 2021. <https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2021-03/Hon_Jason_Smith_Response_Letter_0.pdf>MSTRUCK-7781393 MSTRUCK",House Judiciary Subcommittee Issues Testimony From Major Cities Chiefs Association
920,"School districts that make mask-wearing voluntary for students too young to be eligible for COVID-19 vaccines are ""legally reckless"" and could be vulnerable to lawsuits, one expert says.
But a suburban school district said its attorneys and insurers greenlighted its plan to let families choose whether students should wear masks in school.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revised its guidance for schools Tuesday to now recommend all students, faculty and staff members, and visitors begin the school year wearing masks indoors regardless of vaccination status.
""This new science on the delta variant is worrisome and requires changes to our guidance,"" CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said. lllinois public health officials said the state is ""fully adopting"" the new CDC recommendation.
The CDC, in its initial recommendation two weeks ago, said unvaccinated students should wear masks in school while vaccinated students need not.
But numerous suburban school boards, including many serving students under age 12 who are too young to be vaccinated against COVID-19, decided to make face masks optional in classrooms despite warnings from public health agencies, medical professionals and groups such as the American Academy of Pediatrics.
""In my opinion, school districts which adopt ‘masks optional’ policies are behaving in a legally reckless manner,"" said Shawn Collins, a Naperville attorney who has won multiple class actions lawsuits involving health issues. ""They are contradicting this public health guidance, which subjects them to serious legal risk if anyone contracts COVID from contact that originated at a school.""
The state of Illinois, in ""updated guidance for COVID-19 prevention in K-12 schools,"" raised the same concern on Tuesday.
""School districts that decide not to follow the CDC’s guidance should consult with their insurers regarding risk assumption and liability coverage. Insurers may be unwilling to cover liabilities created as a result of failure to adhere to public health guidance,"" a news release about the new guidelines said.
But leaders in Wheaton Warrenville Unit District 200, one of the districts implementing voluntary masking, said they had consulted with their attorneys and insurance carriers.
""While a district is never without risk when we have students in our school buildings, we remain confident in the mitigation efforts that are in place,"" Superintendent Jeff Schuler said. ""We had elementary students in our schools throughout the entire 2020-2021 school year. We layered mitigations that included distancing, ventilation and filtering, keeping kids home when sick, surveillance testing, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquette, cleaning, data monitoring, and use of masks.""
Schuler said those efforts will remain in place for the coming school year.
""We will continue to layer those mitigations into next school year and will make adjustments in both directions when needed and appropriate to educate our students and keep them safe,"" he said.
Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday he hadn’t had a chance to read the new guidance from the CDC, but he noted the state has used the federal agency’s guidance in the past to drive Illinois’ mitigation policies.
""There’s no doubt that it will weigh heavily on decisions that I’ll make for the state of Illinois,"" he said.
In addition to the school guidance, the CDC also recommended fully vaccinated people wear masks in indoor public settings in counties with high or substantial risk of community transmission. Walensky blamed the policy shift on ""new science"" related to the delta variant of COVID-19.
""The delta variant is showing every day its willingness to outsmart us,"" she said during a national teleconference with reporters Tuesday.
The new guidance from the CDC bolsters Collins’ belief that school districts should follow recommended public health guidelines.
""I see no legal justification for such a school district decision, especially with a dangerous and highly transmissible variant currently causing skyrocketing infections, hospitalizations and deaths across the country,"" Collins said.
State law gives school districts immunity from liability for injuries in a number of situations, University of Illinois College of Law Professor Robin Fretwell Wilson said.
That includes officials in a position that involves determining policy or the exercise of discretion.
""My reading of this is that these guys are going to have a huge zone of authority to set that policy, and if they mess up, I don’t see them being held liable for that,"" said Wilson, director of the university’s Institute of Government and Public Affairs.
However, that won’t necessarily stop lawsuits.
""A lot of times, if you see a barrier to liability like the immunity rules, you can creatively style your complaint to try to avoid the barrier to liability,"" Wilson said.
Collins said he thinks that a ""deliberate and considered decision to refuse to follow public health guidance, with full knowledge of potentially devastating consequences, is, in my opinion, well beyond mere negligence, and falls into a legal category where school districts are no longer immunized under the law.""

921,"Aug. 21 - As commuter rail habits continue to change, affected in part by the increasing number of people able to work from home, Naperville may eliminate quarterly parking permits at Metra station lots in favor of daily fees.
Councilman Paul Hinterlong said he'd like to see every lot converted to daily fees.
""I think the time has come to take another look at our permitting process. I know that there's a lot of frustration with it, a lot of unfairness with it,"" Hinterlong said.
The Naperville City Council got the process rolling this week by agreeing the city will no longer issue new quarterly permits for Fifth Avenue train station lots and will close the waiting list for new permits as city staff investigates technology that would make it easier for rail commuters to park at the Fifth Avenue or Route 59 stations.
Demand is high for quarterly permits because they give the holder the security of knowing they will have a parking spot in a specific lot, said Jennifer Louden, deputy director of Naperville's Transportation, Engineering and Development department.
The permits have caused heartache for applicants who wait as long as seven years on a list to buy one at the preferred Fifth Avenue station and headaches for the city because existing permit holders don't park in the lots on a daily basis, leaving prime spots going unused.
The situation also generated an underground market of people subletting their spaces to others, prompting the city to crack down by requiring permit holders to provide vehicle registration information at renewal time.
Louden said the alternative is more daily fee-only parking, which is available on a first-come, first-served basis. While these spaces offer the most flexibility, commuters are not guaranteed a spot will be available.
The ideal solution, Louden said, is a parking program that provides both the flexibility to park a vehicle when needed and the certainty that a space will be available.
In addition no longer issuing new quarterly permits, the city will convert the Parkview permit lot at the Fifth Avenue station to daily fee parking, adding 122 daily fee spaces. Parkview permit holders would be moved to the Burlington lot.
At the same time, the city will hire a consultant to help determine the best route for maximizing use of commuter parking lots.
Hinterlong cited data from the city's commuter parking survey that shows the COVID-19 pandemic has changed parking needs.
Of the 2,172 rail commuters who responded to the survey last fall, 76% said they used Metra rail system four or more days per week before the pandemic but only 37% planned to resume commuting four or more days per week when the pandemic ends.
The majority of respondents, 45%, indicated they'd likely commute one to three days per week.
Although Metra ridership has been steadily increasing in 2021, Louden said it's impossible to predict when, if ever, ridership will reach pre-pandemic levels of 4,100 and 5,800 daily riders at the Fifth Avenue and Route 59 stations, respectively.
Councilman Benny White said he'd prefer a gradual approach because he's talked to people who have been waiting for years to obtain a quarterly permit.
If the city tells them their permit spot is going away after they've been waiting for that long, ""they're going to go crazy,"" he said
Converting more spaces to daily fees now, can get commuters acclimated as ridership picks up in the coming months, Councilwoman Theresa Sullivan said said. ""If we wait until demand comes back, then we're actually behind,"" she said.
A way to check parking availability online does not currently exist but is something the city would like to investigate, Louden said.
""Providing more information to the commuters will allow them to make those decisions,"" she said.
While there are apps available to reserve a parking spot, there is no out-of-the-box solution that would work for all Naperville lots at the moment, Louden said.
City staff members are ""parking generalists, not parking specialists,"" she said. A consultant could evaluate commuter parking programs and make recommendations on improvements to the parking fee structure and technology.
The plan approved by the council also calls for pursuing actions to balance the demand for parking and mitigate traffic congestion around the Metra stations.
While Pace commuter feeder bus routes were eliminated during the pandemic, the city will focus on how to reintroduce commuter bus service as commuter activity increases, Louden said.
The city also will maintain appropriate loading and unloading zones for transit vehicles and designate ride-share spaces, she said.
Quarterly permits in Naperville cost $120 for residents and nonresidents in the Parkview and Burlington lots, $110 for residents and $135 for nonresidents in the Kroehler lot, and $120 for residents and $145 for nonresidents in the Route 59 lot.
Daily fees are $2 per day at both Metra stations except for spaces at the DuPage Children's Museum and 190 E. 5th Ave., which cost $5 per day.

SINGAPORE, Feb. 26, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Vela Diagnostics announced that it has added ViroKey™ SQ FLEX SARS-CoV-2 Genotyping Assay and ViroKey™ SARS-CoV-2 ID RT-PCR Test to its portfolio offering.
The ViroKey™ SQ FLEX SARS-CoV-2 Genotyping Assay (RUO) harnesses next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology to sequence the whole SARS-CoV-2 genome. The accompanying Sentosa™ SQ Reporter software calls out mutations and classifies them by lineage, thereby aiding in the research and understanding of the molecular epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic. According to WHO, whole genome sequencing is essential for improving effectiveness/sensitivity of molecular diagnostics, serological assays, vaccine design and anti-viral therapy, and aiding investigation of transmission routes and outbreak clusters.
""We offer a highly automated workflow which requires less than 2 hours of hands-on time from sample to report generation. With this ease-of-use, laboratories can very quickly adopt an NGS solution that would become an important tool in this pandemic situation,"" said Managing Director, Andreas Goertz.
The ViroKey™ SARS-CoV-2 ID RT-PCR Test (RUO) is able to quickly identify variants present in positive samples. Variants include the B.1.1.7 (UK), B.1.351 (South Africa) and P.1 (Brazil) lineages.
""Identification of variants that may cause more severe disease or be more contagious is critical in our global response to the pandemic. Such variants may lead to more cases of COVID-19, putting strain on healthcare systems and potentially leading to more deaths. As such, they need to be identified promptly for measures to be taken,"" says Vice President, Jim Mismas.
""With emerging variants, like the recent B.1.526 from New York, that may weaken vaccine effectiveness, the need for mutation identification becomes clear. We are now able to offer options for quick detection of known variants of concerns, and all future variants for better pandemic management,"" says Director of Business Development, Scott Cassidy. 
The variant identification test can be used in conjunction with the ViroKey™ SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Test v2.0, which has received FDA Emergency Use Authorization, CE-IVD and TGA approval, and HSA Provisional Authorization.

924,"WEST HAVEN — The color purple makes Susan Brown smile. Now, she hopes it  also will play a big role in helping to fight hunger around the region.
Brown has used the eye-catching color for a series of outdoor wooden food pantries to store nonperishable and shelf-stable items in public spaces. The Purple Pantry Boxes project was launched in Milford about two years ago, with boxes built by Chris Grejtak.
On Tuesday, the organization’s 12th pantry box debuted in downtown West Haven on the site of the First Congregational Church.
Maintenance of the box will be overseen by volunteers affiliated with the church, who reached out to Brown to request a box.

Brown began the pantry project as a way of addressing a need  she saw in her former line of work as a public defender.
“There were so many people who walked into the courthouse who were in need of help and support,” Brown said at the time the Milford boxes began. “I thought it would be a really good idea to do something to help people. That was the goal.”
After establishing Purple Pantry Boxes as a 501(c)(3) and learning about municipal approval processes, Brown has expanded her operations. Whereas 100 percent of financial donations to the nonprofit once went to food, she said it  now is closer to 98 percent — the project has grown so large that she pays a small amount in rent for warehousing after moving the food out of her home.
Exactly what foods will be in the box will depend on what people take from it, Brown said.  Volunteers will observe which items move quickest and therefore represent those in  highest demand, she said. And while  Brown said the organization prefers donations be made at either Beachside Nutrition or Seaside Nutrition in Milford, it is possible for community members to donate food items of their own to the box for others to pick up.
The Rev. E. Carl Howard of First Congregational Church said he believes the box will be a valuable — and much-needed — resource.
“I’m excited we can participate in helping a community in need,” he said.
Nicole Randolph, who attends the church, is a trained volunteer who has helped to stock pantry boxes in Milford but will focus on stocking the box outside First Congregational Church.
“West Haven also has a need for these boxes,” she said.
Right now, Brown said, the organization goes through 124 cans of tuna and 60 jars of peanut butter weekly.
According to officials who work in addressing hunger, the COVID-19 pandemic has made the issue of hunger more severe.
Jason Jakubowski, president and CEO of Connecticut Foodshare, said the negative economic effects  of the pandemic naturally was detrimental to people’s ability to buy food.
“The good news is the number of people in Connecticut who are food insecure is 428,000, and that is lower than it was a year ago at the peak of the pandemic, but we are still not back to where we were pre-pandemic,” he said.

Jakubowski said the nature of food pantry operations had to change abruptly because of the pandemic, as social distancing became imperative and communal meals  no longer were advisable.
“That’s not how food banks and pantries were set up or how we were intended to be run,” he said. “It absolutely changed our entire world overnight.”
However,  Jakubowski said the pantry, which is affiliated with Feeding America, currently has 700 statewide pantry partners.
Paul Bronson, outreach coordinator for Vertical Church, said West Haven pantry operations also work in partnership.
“We are going to anticipate a bigger demand as the spike goes up, because things are closing again,” Bronson said of the rising number of COVID-19 cases across the state. “Like the senior centers in New Haven are closed back down. The seniors will become our biggest concern right now.”
Bronson said that, despite spiking infections, pantry operators  have the advantage of knowing more about the coronavirus and its transmission now than they did two years ago.
“We’re confident we are equipped to respond quickly,” he said.
West Haven Mayor Nancy Rossi helped to stock the city’s new pantry box for the first time Tuesday.
“There’s such a need. Hopefully there might be a case where someone’s luck turns around and they can donate themselves,” she said.
Brown said  she  already has received phone calls from contributors in Milford sharing that that exact scenario  already had happened there.

925,"Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, issued the following news release:U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) and Ben Ray Lujan (D-N.M.) and U.S. Representative Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-N.M.) announced that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recently awarded over $8.5 million in COVID-19 relief grants, in addition to over $2.8 million announced in March, to 28 New Mexico airports. The funding is being made available through the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act (CRRSAA) that Congress passed in late December 2020.The CRRSAA included $2 billion in funds to be awarded as economic relief to eligible U.S. airports for costs related to operations, personnel, cleaning, sanitization, janitorial services, combating the spread of pathogens at the airport, and debt service payments. Concessions funds provide reliefs to concessionaires at airports - car-rental, parking, and in-terminal concessions - from rent and minimum annual guarantees.""The unprecedented decline in air travel throughout the pandemic has taken its toll on small and local airports that connect communities all across New Mexico to tourism, business opportunities, and commercial aviation,"" said Heinrich. ""I'm proud to support this critical funding that we secured in the December COVID-19 relief package so that these airports in New Mexico can continue providing critical services and play their role in the state's economic recovery.""""In December, Congress came together to pass a bipartisan package to keep the government funded and help New Mexicans weather the COVID-19 pandemic. This legislation provided crucial investments for our communities, including airports across New Mexico and the small businesses that serve them. This crucial relief for our airports and small businesses will help them keep their doors open and continue supporting local economies,"" said Lujan, a member of the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation. ""I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass the American Jobs Plan, which will help create jobs and opportunities and make investments in our airports and transportation systems.""""It's wonderful that New Mexico will receive 16 grants from the Department of Transportation to help support small businesses located in our airports. These businesses have suffered greatly during the pandemic but help is here,"" said Leger Fernandez. ""The Aztec Municipal and Raton Municipal Airports in my district will receive crucial support. We remain committed to securing the necessary relief for communities in every zip code to keep our local economies running and continue the work to build back better. I thank our Senators for the work they've done and look forward to continuing to work with the New Mexico delegation to facilitate more investments into our communities.""To distribute these funds, the FAA established the Airport Coronavirus Response Grant Program. The FAA makes grants to all airports that are part of the national airport system, including all commercial service airports, all reliever airports, and some public-owned general aviation airports.Under this new Airport Coronavirus Response Grant Program:* Primary commercial service airports, those with more than 10,000 annual passenger boardings, will share $1.75 billion based on the number of annual boardings, in a similar way to how they currently receive Airport Improvement Program (AIP) entitlement funds.* Primary commercial service airports will share an additional $200 million based on the number of annual boardings, and these funds will then be available for these airports to provide relief from rent and minimum annual guarantees to on-airport car rental, on-airport parking, and in-terminal airport concessions. Airports will provide this relief to each airport concession based on its proportional share of the total annual rent and minimum annual guarantees for the airport.* Non-primary commercial service and general aviation airports will share $45 million based on their airport categories, such as National, Regional, Local, and Basic. Of that $45 million, airports that participate in the FAA Contract Tower Program will divide $5 million equally.A breakdown of the $8,521,241 in grants announced in April is below.* $6,754,069, and $565,730 in concession funds, to Albuquerque International Sunport in Albuquerque, New Mexico* $1,009,435, and $5,948 in concession funds, to Lea County Regional Airport in Hobbs, New Mexico* $57,162 for the ACRGP Contract Tower program to Double Eagle II Airport in Albuquerque, New Mexico* $23,000 to Dona Ana County International Jetport in Santa Teresa, New Mexico* $13,000 to Belen Regional Airport in Belen, New Mexico* $13,000 to Portales Municipal Airport in Portales, New Mexico* $13,000 to Raton Municipal Airport (Crews Field) in Raton, New Mexico* $12,897 in concessions funds to Roswell International Air Center in Roswell, New Mexico* $9,000 to Aztec Municipal Airport in Aztec, New Mexico* $9,000 to Fort Sumner Municipal Airport in Fort Sumner, New Mexico* $9,000 to Grants-Milan Municipal Airport in Grants, New Mexico* $9,000 to Hatch Municipal Airport in Hatch, New Mexico* $9,000 to Socorro Municipal Airport in Socorro, New Mexico* $9,000 to Truth or Consequences Municipal Airport in Truth or Consequences, New MexicoA breakdown of the $2,838,545 in grants announced in March is below.* $1,570,927 to Santa Fe Municipal Airport in Santa Fe, New Mexico* $1,020,456 to Roswell International Air Center in Roswell, New Mexico* 57,162 for the ACRGP Contract Tower program to Four Corners Regional Airport in Farmington, New Mexico* $23,000 to Grant County Airport in Silver City, New Mexico* $23,000 to Artesia Municipal Airport in Artesia, New Mexico* $23,000 to Clovis Regional Airport in Clovis, New Mexico* $23,000 to Las Cruces International Airport in Las Cruces, New Mexico* $23,000 to Sierra Blanca Regional Airport in Ruidoso, New Mexico* $13,000 to Alamogordo-White Sands Regional Airport in Alamogordo, New Mexico* $13,000 to Gallup Municipal Airport in Gallup, New Mexico* $13,000 to Los Alamos Airport in Los Alamos, New Mexico* $9,000 to Angel Fire Airport in Angel Fire, New Mexico* $9,000 to Conchas State Park Airport in Conchas Dam, New Mexico* $9,000 to Lordsburg Municipal Airport in Lordsburg, New Mexico* $9,000 to Springer Municipal Airport in Springer, New MexicoMSTRUCK-7454008 MSTRUCK","Sen.

927,"Within hours of the announcement, Britain, Israel and Singapore had restricted travel from South Africa and some nearby countries.Scientists in South Africa on Thursday identified a concerning new coronavirus variant with mutations that one scientist said marked a ""big jump in evolution,"" prompting several countries to quickly limit travel from the region.Within hours, Britain, Israel and Singapore had restricted travel from South Africa and some neighboring countries, citing the threat of the new variant. By Friday, markets were down in Japan in response to the discovery, and officials in Australia and in New Zealand said that they were monitoring the new variant closely.The European Commission will also propose restricting air travel to the bloc from southern Africa based on concerns over the variant, Ursula von der Leyen, the commission's president, said in a Twitter post on Friday. She referred to it by its scientific name, B.1.1.529.In the past two days, scientists detected the variant after observing an increase in infections in South Africa's economic hub surrounding Johannesburg. So far, 22 positive cases have been identified in the country, according to South Africa's National Institute for Communicable Diseases. Two cases were detected in Hong Kong, both apparently linked to someone who had traveled from South Africa. No cases have been detected yet in Britain.A number of variants have emerged since the onset of the pandemic. One underlying concern about them is whether they will stymie the fight against the virus or limit the effectiveness of vaccines. South African scientists will meet with the World Health Organization technical team on Friday to discuss the new variant, and the authorities will assign it a letter of the Greek alphabet.But governments are not waiting to impose restrictions. By Thursday evening, Britain had banned flights from South Africa, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Namibia and Zimbabwe, starting at noon local time on Friday. The six nations will be added to the country's red list, which would require British travelers coming from those nations to quarantine on arrival.""More data is needed but we're taking precautions now,"" Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said on Twitter.In a statement posted Friday on a government website, South Africa said it would urge Britain to reconsider the measure, saying: ""The U.K.'s decision to temporarily ban South Africans from entering the U.K. seems to have been rushed, as even the World Health Organization is yet to advise on the next steps.""Within a few hours, officials from Israel and Singapore had announced that they, too, would add the same countries to their red lists, along with Mozambique.In December 2020, South Africa was the first nation to report the appearance of the Beta variant, which has now spread to nearly 70 countries. Scientists have been concerned that some clinical trials have shown that vaccines offer less protection against the Beta variant. Since then, the more virulent and aggressive Delta variant has spread all over the world and is believed to be fueling the latest surge in cases.The variant has also been identified in Botswana. The country's health ministry confirmed in a statement that four cases of the new variant were detected in people who were all fully vaccinated. All four were tested before their planned travel.With over 1,200 new infections, South Africa's daily infection rate is much lower than in Germany, where new cases are driving a wave. However, the density of mutations on this new variant raises fears that it could be highly contagious, leading scientists to sound the alarm early.""This variant did surprise us, it has a big jump in evolution, many more mutations than we expected, especially after a very severe third wave of Delta,"" said Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform.The B.1.1.529 variant has a ""very unusual constellation of mutations,"" with more than 30 mutations in the spike protein alone, Mr. de Oliveira said. The spike protein is the chief target of antibodies that the immune system produces to fight a coronavirus infection. So many mutations raised concerns that Omicron's spike might be able to evade antibodies produced by either a previous infection or a vaccine.Scientists are still unclear on how effective existing vaccines will be against the new variant, which displays mutations that might resist neutralization.The variant shares similarities with the Lambda and Beta variants, which are associated with an innate evasion of immunity, said Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist at the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform.""All these things are what give us some concern that this variant might have not just enhanced transmissibility, so spread more efficiently, but might also be able to get around parts of the immune system and the protection we have in our immune system,"" Mr. Lessells said.The new variant has largely been detected among young people, the cohort that also has the lowest vaccination rate in South Africa. Just over a quarter of those ages between 18 and 34 in South Africa are vaccinated, said Dr. Joe Phaahla, the country's minister of health.While cases of the new variant are mainly concentrated in the country's economic hub, particularly in the capital, Pretoria, it is ""only a matter of time"" before the virus spreads across the country as schools close and families prepare to travel for the holiday season, Mr. Phaahla said.Alexandra E. Petri contributed reporting.Alexandra E. Petri contributed reporting.An inoculation in Diepsloot Township. Four cases of the new variant were detected in people who were fully vaccinated.

",COVID-19 on campus: USC reports 168 active cases
931,"Wisconsin fared better than both the national average and all four 
of its neighboring states in terms of the percentage of jobs lost 
during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to 
a new report.
The report, released Thursday by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy 
Forum, found that between September 2019 and September 2020, 
Wisconsin saw a 5.2% drop in total jobs, compared with 5.3% in 
Iowa, 7.4% in Minnesota, 7.8% in Illinois and 7.9% in Michigan. 
Nationwide job loss was 6.8% over that span, according to data from 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
""In this region, only Iowa rivals Wisconsin in limiting its 
employment losses during this period,"" the report states. ""Since 
then, more recent monthly survey data running through January show 
relatively modest changes in overall employment in Wisconsin 
compared to September and to other states.""
At the same time, Wisconsin was still down more than 150,000 jobs 
by September of last year compared with a year prior. Businesses 
that rely on face-to-face interactions with customers were the 
hardest hit, particularly those in leisure and hospitality, which 
saw an 18.8% drop in jobs over that span.
The Forum's report notes Wisconsin's large manufacturing sector saw 
a 5.5% drop in employment, accounting for more than 26,000 jobs, 
between September 2019 and September 2020, compared with a 6.8% 
drop in Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota and Michigan. Wisconsin's 
percentage of jobs lost during the pandemic was lower than 
neighboring states in nearly every sector.
The report states that additional research may be needed to explain 
why Wisconsin's economy fared better than neighboring states, but 
the Forum does note that the state's share of employment in 
industries hardest hit by the pandemic was lower than the national 
average.
A Department of Workforce Development economist said last month 
Wisconsin's diverse economic portfolio, which includes a large 
manufacturing industry that was less affected by the pandemic than 
some sectors, helped ease the pandemic's impact on the overall 
economy.
The Department of Workforce Development reported earlier this month 
that the state's unemployment rate in March was 3.8%, compared with 
6% nationwide.
While preliminary data show the state added 12,900 total non-farm 
and 11,100 private-sector jobs between February and March of this 
year, Wisconsin was still down 129,000 non-farm jobs and 98,300 
private-sector jobs when comparing this March to last March.
The Forum also notes $3.2 billion in additional federal funding 
allocated to the state in the latest stimulus could help industries 
hardest hit by the pandemic continue to bounce back.
""Thoughtful and strategic use of these dollars will be essential,"" 
according to the report. ""While they will face many competing 
demands, state and local policymakers may wish to consider how to 
prioritize the industries most affected by employment losses in 
2020.""
Gov. Tony Evers has pledged to spend $2.5 billion of those funds on 
economic relief for families, workers and small-business owners, 
which includes $50 million for the tourism industry and $600 
million to support businesses affected by the pandemic - which 
includes $420 million in grants to small businesses affected by the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
The governor plans to provide additional details on how funds will 
be allocated once guidelines are provided by the federal 
government.
All told, the state of Wisconsin and local governments are poised 
to receive close to $20 billion in federal COVID-19 funds passed by 
Congress during the past 13 months - more than twice the funds 
received by the state during the Great Recession.
Jobless aid
The Department of Workforce Development on Wednesday announced an 
expansion of the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program following 
the federal government's expansion of the program in February.
The department this week plans to mail an estimated 28,000 people 
who were initially denied PUA benefits notices informing them that 
they can reapply under three new coronavirus-related reasons that 
may now allow them to qualify.
Individuals eligible under the new expansion include:
* Someone who was denied continued unemployment benefits because 
they did not return to work or accept an offer at a worksite that 
was out of compliance with local, state or national health and 
safety standards including face-mask requirements, 
social-distancing measures or access to personal protective 
equipment.
* Those who provided services to an educational 
institution or service agency who are unemployed due to volatility 
in their work schedule directly caused by the pandemic.
* Someone 
whose hours have been reduced or who was laid off due to a COVID-19 
public health emergency.
Individuals who previously applied for PUA benefits can backdate 
their applications to when they were first impacted by the 
pandemic. Those who did not previously file for expanded benefits 
may still be eligible under the new rules, but may be subject to 
backdating limitations.
Those eligible could receive up to 79 weeks of back payments and 
department officials expect to release ""millions of dollars"" of 
additional payments under the new expansion.

",ANALYSIS: JOBS LOST WERE LESS THAN MANY
934,"Sam Martin says everything he and his son had envisioned happening at Arizona State last year, is taking place now, only he's not wearing the maroon and gold of the Sun Devils, he's donning a University of Kansas uniform instead.
The Southern California native has saved his best for last. While the March Madness team talk has focused on the upsets and the unprecedented run of No. 15 seed St. Peter's, it is Martin whose individual performance has the college basketball world buzzing.
Martin has been the team's leading scorer for all three postseason games with 58 points (19.3 ppg). But those points have come in just 77 minutes and he has come off the bench in all three games.
The 6-foot point guard tossed in 23 points with seven rebounds and three assists, playing 27 minutes in the Jayhawks' 66-61 Sweet 16 victory over Providence which sends Kansas (31-6), the last No. 1 seed remaining, into Sunday's Elite Eight showdown with No. 10 Miami (26-10) at Chicago's United Center.
One of the under the radar statistics from that game was that Martin drew eight fouls on the opponent, including a key charge in the closing minutes when the outcome was still in doubt.
He had 20 points in the 79-72 victory over Creighton and 15 in the 83-56 win over Texas Southern in the NCAA opener.
Those showings are part of a run of five straight games in double figures which started with the last two games of the Big 12 tournament. What makes that all the more impressive is that before that stretch of games, Martin hadn't scored in double figures since Dec. 18. The big reason for that was a knee injury which he tried to play through but eventually sidelined him for seven games.
""He feels good about finally being healthy and being able to show what he can do,"" Sam Martin said, on the phone from Chicago where he is watching his son play. ""He needs that speed, that burst because without that he is an average Joe. That's what was missing when he was hurt.""
Martin played 114 games over four years in Tempe, earning multiple All-Pac-12 honors. Those accolades included first-team selections in both his junior and senior seasons. He is second in ASU's record book in assists, sixth in scoring, and eighth in steals.
His senior season was a difficult one with the team plagued by injuries, multiple stoppages due to COVID-19 as well as team chemistry issues. Martin declared for the draft which prompted ASU coach Bobby Hurley to go out and recruit other guards.
Martin sought out feedback from NBA personnel and Sam said previously that feedback was ""good but not great."" That prompted Remy to choose to go back for a repeat senior season in hopes of enhancing his draft prospects.
Since Hurley had already landed the services of other guards, Martin transferred to Kansas which had recruited him heavily out of high school. He also preferred to leave the Pac-12 footprint so he wouldn't have to play against a school that had meant so much to him.
There was the natural transition to new location a new coach with different philosophies under which Martin previously played.
""The biggest transition for him was the defensive part of the game,"" Martin said. ""The offensive part was different but not something he had trouble adjusting to,"" Sam Martin said.
Ironically, Martin's career has pretty much come full circle. As a true freshman in the 2017-2018 season in Tempe, Martin came off the bench, even earning Pac-12 Sixth Man of the Year honors. He was a catalyst in ASU's 95-85 upset of then No. 1 Kansas in Lawrence.
Now he's doing the same for the Jayhawks with his college days nearing an end. While many Kansas faithful have clamored for him to move back into the starting lineup, Sam says that shouldn't change. He may not be starting, but he's playing starter minutes and he's in the game when it matters.
""What they're doing is working. No need to change it,"" he said.
Martin is also nearing a milestone, needing just 13 points to reach 2,000 for his career, the first 1,754 of which came as a Sun Devil. Sam Martin said he, Remy, and their entire family still love Tempe, Arizona in general and appreciates being in the ASU fold for four years.
While there were some obstacles along the way this season, everything seems to be working out the way Martin had hoped. He is getting the chance to shine on a big stage and is three games away from being part of a national championship. And yes, his stock is rising.
""You find out what you're made of when times are tough,"" Sam Martin said. ""This is everything we were hoping would happen last year. This is really what we envisioned, it's just a little later in coming.""",Former ASU standout Martin sparking Kansas

For many, last year's Fourth of July didn't go quite as planned. Countless families were forced to modify their usual celebrations because of the pandemic. But this year, things are different.With COVID restrictions being lifted, including in Indiana, Hoosiers are ready to celebrate this holiday season pre-pandemic style. That means family barbecues, fireworks and the usual festivities.
""It's been a tough year to 18 months, so we're really excited to get back out there and get back to our normal lives,"" said Matthew Connelly, an emergency medicine physician in the Community Health Network.
Still, people should celebrate with caution and make sure they are taking steps to stay healthy and safe during the holiday weekend, according to Connelly and others.
IndyStar asked three experts for their tips on how to enjoy this July Fourth weekend safely. Each expert pointed to various precautions that would help prevent COVID-19 exposure and spread, heat exhaustion and firework-related injuries.
Playing it COVID-safe for Fourth
Whether you're planning a family gathering or attending one, or perhaps you're heading out to a bar or restaurant, or maybe you're venturing to a holiday-related function, you may find yourself amid a mixed crowd of vaccinated and unvaccinated people. With that, it is inevitable to face some health risks.
The U.S. has made great strides with managing COVID, part of which can be attributed to the 46% of the population that The New York Times recorded as fully vaccinated. Marion County, however, is a little behind: The county Public Health Department director Dr. Virginia Caine reported that about only 39% of Indianapolis residents have been fully vaccinated. With new variants continuing to be discovered, such as the delta variant, it is important people remain COVID conscious.
Here are 6 ways to remain COVID-safe this holiday season:
All of our experts agreed that one of the best modes of protection would be to avoid crowded spaces and large gatherings. If you find yourself in a crowded space or with a lot of people – whether you are vaccinated or not – it's still best to wear masks, especially if indoors. That is particularly true for individuals who live with people who are ineligible for the vaccine, such as children under 12, some immunocompromised patients and other adults with certain health conditions.
It is also a good idea to keep track of all attendees. That way, if anyone gets sick, there is an idea of who needs to be contacted and warned of a potential exposure.
It is important to continue to wash or sanitize your hands. The ideal holiday event would include handwashing stations and plenty of hand sanitizer, suggested Elizabeth Delery, Assistant Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Marion University College of Osteopathic Medicine.
Food is a very important aspect of the holiday season to consider keeping safe. This could include minimizing the number of people responsible for preparing the food for your holiday event. Additionally, Delery recommends that those responsible for preparing and distributing the food be vaccinated, as well as avoiding certain food setups, such as buffets. That style ""is a bit riskier because people will be walking past the food and will be breathing on it,"" Delery warned. ""If there is a buffet style event, it might be better to allow vaccinated individuals to get their food first. However, individual plates or servings that are pre-portioned and that have been prepared by a vaccinated individual would be even better.""
Delery also proposed serving less finger foods and having more foods that require utensils. The less eating with your hands, the fewer opportunities for ""putting germs into your mouth."" Let's try swapping the barbequed chicken for pulled chicken instead. This especially goes for children. Don't forget to make sure they are washing their hands and not sharing drinks or utensils with others.
With COVID in mind, Dr. Amy Beth Kressel points out that outdoor activities for this holiday season will be safer. That's because ""there's an enormous amount of air moving, plus the humidity helps degrade the virus more quickly,"" said Kressel, the Medical Director of Infection Prevention and Antimicrobial Stewardship at Eskenazi Health. Kressel still stressed the importance of avoiding crowded areas, even outdoors, especially if unvaccinated. She said maintaining six feet distance and limiting maskless contact with others is crucial. If this is difficult, be mindful of the amount of time spent unmasked or in a crowd, as the exposure time is key.
Many of these COVID safety practices can also keep individuals protected against other illnesses such as a common cold, the flu or stomach viruses, Connelly noted.
Beat the Heat
While the UV rays from the sun and the better circulation of the outdoors are pros for hosting or attending a more COVID-safe holiday event, it's not without its own risks.
As an emergency room physician, Connelly cautioned that warmer weather also causes many heat-related illnesses – such as heat stroke or heat exhaustion – that can have major threatening health consequences.
""[The high temperatures] can cause the body to start to shut down and become overheated,"" Connelly explained. ""It just doesn't run properly.""
Here are 4 of the best ways to avoid heat-related complications this weekend:
Connelly suggested that the best way to prevent heat-related illnesses is to remain hydrated. This will also include minimizing the intake of alcohol, he added, which can promote dehydration. Consider having regular water, flavored waters and even Gatorade on hand to keep guests hydrated.
For the event planners, Connelly recommended being sure that the location has enough shaded areas or a place for cooling off. Whether it's a porch, a tent, or even a big tree, it is important for guests to be able to step away to escape the heat for a bit. Enjoying a good swim at a nearby lake or pool also is a great for guests to cool off. But be careful to monitor guests, especially children, around the water to prevent drowning and injuries, Connelly added.
Keep a close eye on the elderly guests, children, and individuals with known health complications such as kidney and heart diseases, because they among some those who are most vulnerable to heat.
While dodging heat-related illnesses, it is just as important to evade skin damage from the sun. Wear your sunscreen of SPF50 or above, said Connelly. If you are very sensitive to the sun and more prone to sunburn, consider wearing hats or lightweight clothing that covers the skin and minimizes direct sun exposure
Fireworks across the sky
A good fireworks show can elicit many ""oohs"" and ""ahhhs"", but fireworks can cause potentially harmful and unexpected outcomes, too, Connelly cautioned.
In the US, there are 10,000 to 12,000 reported fireworks-related injuries seen in emergency departments every year, Connelly mentioned. That may seem like a lot, and yet the number of these injuries, he said, is likely underreported. These injuries range from minor burns to more life-altering injuries such as blindness or loss of a hand.
And that doesn't just go for fireworks.
""Sparklers, for example, burn at almost 1,800 degrees Fahrenheit,"" Connelly cautioned, ""which is four or five times as hot as your settings on your barbeque grills.""
Here are 4 ways to prevent fireworks-related injuries this holiday season:
Connelly cautioned that using sparklers or any fireworks at home should only be done using safety measures: Supervise children who are operating fireworks, wear safety goggles and gloves, keep a bucket of water around to be sure that the sparklers are completely out.
It also is important to be mindful of location and space when operating fireworks at home. Connelly noted that many of these fireworks have ""a ton of explosive power."" Handlers should pay close attention while setting up fireworks and be sure to stick to lighting one at a time. Guests can do their part, too, by making sure to always maintain a safe distance from the fireworks.
""Sparklers ... burn
at almost 1,800

943,"

Long hailed for his bravery during the Rwandan genocide, he is now charged with being a terrorist leaser. Did Rwanda changed or did he?

Early in the evening of Aug, 27, 2020, Paul Rusesabagina stepped off a flight from Chicago and walked into Terminal 3 at Dubai International Airport. He had been in the air for 14 hours, but his journey wasn't done: Later that night, he planned to travel on to Bujumbura, the main city in the small Central African nation Burundi. Passing through immigration, Rusesabagina - who lived in San Antonio, Texas, but was originally from Rwanda, Burundi's neighbor - texted his wife to let her know he had arrived in Dubai. ""Are you safe?"" she wrote back. ""I'm fine,"" he replied. Then he checked in at a nearby Ibis Styles hotel.
A friend was waiting for him there: Constantin Niyomwungere, a prominent Burundi-born pastor who ran a dozen evangelical churches in Burundi, Rwanda, Belgium and elsewhere. It was at Niyomwungere's invitation that Rusesabagina had come, ostensibly to talk to the pastor's congregations in Burundi about a dramatic series of events that happened a quarter century ago. During the Rwandan genocide of 1994, when Rusesabagina was the manager of the Hotel des Mille Collines in Kigali, Rwanda's capital, some 1,300 people sheltered there for more than two months while murderous ethnic violence convulsed the country. The steps he took to safeguard this desperate group of guests were later heroicized in the acclaimed 2004 film ""Hotel Rwanda"" - Don Cheadle's portrayal of him earned an Oscar nomination for Best Actor - and Rusesabagina himself became a minor celebrity in the global human rights community. He gave paid speeches at universities, think tanks and corporate gatherings; he started the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation; he collected awards and honorary degrees, including the U.S. Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005, the citation for which praised his ""remarkable courage and compassion in the face of genocidai terror.""
But the invitations had dried up in recent years, and making money became even harder after the pandemic struck in March. ""He had four kids, two just out of college, he didn't have a regular day job, he'd just had cancer, the speaking engagements were few and far between,"" says Kitty Kurth, a senior adviser and spokeswoman at his foundation. Rusesabagina had reason to be grateful for any work he could get, including church presentations in Central Africa. Yet traveling came with its own risks: In the years since leaving Rwanda, Rusesabagina had become a harsh critic of its leader, President Paul Kagame, denouncing him as a dictator and accusing him of carrying out extrajudicial killings. The Rwandan government, for its part, accused Rusesabagina of supporting a rebel army along the country's borders with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi and claimed he was involved in deadly attacks that took place inside Rwanda in 2018.
""I thought: Paul, why do you want to go to Burundi? It's way too close to Rwanda,"" Kurth says. ""Kagame has people all over Burundi."" Rusesabagina hadn't told his family that he was flying to Burundi, saying only that he was going to ""see some people"" in Dubai. ""I asked him, 'Can you please send me your coordinates, all the meetings, all the telephone numbers?' "" his wife, Taciana, told me. ""I didn't have a good feeling about this trip.""
At the hotel in Dubai, Rusesabagina bathed, napped for about three hours, then left for his next flight with Niyomwungere. At the airport, the pastor took his passport and steered him through immigration. Then the two men clambered onto a private jet that had been chartered. Once airborne, they toasted each other with Champagne. Five hours later, most of which Rusesabagina spent asleep, Niyomwungere shook his friend awake. ""We're landing in Bujumbura,"" he said.
As Rusesabagina stepped onto the tarmac, a half dozen armed men emerged from the predawn darkness. Identifying themselves as agents of the Rwanda Investigation Bureau - the country's equivalent of the F.B.I. - they handcuffed him and hustled him into a waiting vehicle. It was only then that Rusesabagina realized that he had fallen into a trap. The plane hadn't landed in Burundi. Their real destination was declared by a sign on the terminal: KIGALI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT.
the origins of the Rwandan genocide stretch back to Belgian rule. In the first half of the 20th century, the colonial overseers deepened divisions between the Hutu, then mostly farmers, who make up a vast majority of the population, and the minority Tutsi, who were mostly cattle herders. The Belgians put Tutsi overwhelmingly in charge of the country, which meant jobs in the bureaucracy, access to higher education and other privileges. But as the Hutu came into power - the country achieved full independence in 1962 - its leaders promoted brutal discrimination against the Tutsi; hundreds of thousands fled the country. In 1990, a Tutsi-led rebel movement, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, advanced from Uganda to within 45 miles of Kigali before the Rwandan military, backed by French troops, pushed them back across the border. As pressure grew on President Juvenal Habyarimana to come to a power-sharing arrangement, Hutu extremists who opposed any compromise began to mobilize.
On the night of April 6, 1994, as Habyarimana flew back from negotiating a peace deal in Tanzania, assailants in Kigali blew up the presidential plane using two shoulder-fired missiles. It has never been conclusively determined which faction carried out the assassination, but the attack set in motion a plot to exterminate the Tutsi. Over the next hundred days - as the outside world looked on, unwilling to intervene - Hutu soldiers, militiamen and even ordinary civilians massacred some 800,000 people, according to a United Nations estimate. The Rwandan government, after it came under Tutsi control, would later put the total number of dead at more than a million - more than 97 percent of whom, it said, were Tutsi - although it included deaths going back to 1991.
As Newsweek's Nairobi bureau chief at the time, I had an intimate view of the violence, which began to unfold just hours after Habyarimana's murder. On April 13, 1994, I joined five other reporters on a six-hour road journey from Bujumbura to Kigali in a Red Cross convoy. After crossing a muddy river that marked the entrance to the city, we drove through roadblocks manned by Interahamwe, the fanatical Hutu militias that carried out much of the killing. I saw corpses lying on the roadsides, in front of militia barricades. At a Red Cross clinic a few blocks from the Mille Collines, a European doctor was treating a Tutsi with deep machete wounds in his skull and torso; he was the sole survivor, the doctor told us, from a busload of Tutsi who were stopped at a barricade and set upon by Interahamwe.
Soon after President Habyarimana's assassination, the Dutch manager of the Mille Collines, before he and other expatriates were evacuated from the country, asked Rusesabagina - then running a sister property nearby, the luxurious Hotel des Diplomates - to take over for him. Rusesabagina, who trained in hotel management at the Kenya Utalii College in Nairobi, straddled Rwanda's ethnic divide: His father, a farmer, was Hutu, and his mother was Tutsi. According to Rwanda's patrilineal customs, this made him a Hutu, but he considered himself a moderate in the ongoing power struggle between the groups. His wife was Tutsi, and two of his brothers-in-law were guerrillas in the Rwandan Patriotic Front. Yet as a hotelier he had made a point of cultivating influential customers, including a Hutu cohort of extremist military officers and politicians who despised the Tutsi.
On April 12, Rusesabagina put his wife and children in a car and joined a government convoy headed toward the Mille Collines, a five-story structure that overlooked the city from a hillside. By then, the desperate crowd in the hotel had reached about 500, including well-connected Tutsi and a few moderate Hutu. I myself checked into the hotel a day later, though I don't believe I crossed paths with Rusesabagina during my brief stay there. A sense of apocalypse pervaded the place. At one point, I stood beside a Tutsi family at a window and watched as a gang of Interahamwe trotted down the street, brandishing bloodstained machetes and clubs. That evening, I pushed open the door to the topfloor dining room, only to be chased away by a group of military officers. After 24 hours, United Nations peacekeepers told the reporters at the Mille Collines that they could not guarantee our safety, and they transported us to the airport.
At the hotel, meanwhile, the numbers of people seeking refuge continued to grow. Early on in the blockade, the government had cut all phone lines to the switchboard, isolating the Mille Collines from the outside world. But a fax line escaped the regime's notice, and in the following days, Rusesabagina often stayed up until 4 a.m., phoning and faxing anyone he could think of - the White House, the U.N., the Peace Corps and Sabena, the hotel's Belgian parent company - hoping to draw attention to the peril faced by those inside.
He also used flattery, bribery and subtle pressure to keep Hutu forces at bay. At 6 a.m. on April 23, Rusesabagina got a call from a military commander, giving those at the hotel 30 minutes to leave. ""It was early to be calling Europe, but far too late to be calling the United States, which had been worthless anyway,"" Rusesabagina wrote in his memoir. ""I pulled out the black binder and started calling all my generals."" Eventually he reached Théoneste Bagosora, the hard-line director of the Ministry of Defense, a man later known as ""Rwanda's Himmler."" Rusesabagina led him to think he might shut down the Hotel des Diplomates - which he continued to manage as well, and where Bagosora resided in comfort - unless he could keep the Mille Collines open. Bagosora grudgingly complied. On another occasion, when Rusesabagina was away at a meeting with Augustin Bizimungu, the army chief of staff, he received word that machete-wielding Interahamwe had managed to get inside the Mille Collines. After Rusesabagina asked him to intervene, Bizimungu rushed to the hotel and chased the militiamen out, declaring, ""If one person kills anyone, I will kill them.""
In May, according to Rusesabagina's memoir, the Rwandan military, the United Nations and the Rwandan Patriotic Front arranged to begin evacuating those sheltering at the Mille Collines. Rusesabagina and his family were among the last to leave, in June, after 76 days in the hotel; they eventually made their way to a camp outside Kigali. For 11 weeks, Rusesabagina had kept the killers at bay. ""He would always say, 'I was just doing my job,' "" says Tom Zoellner, co-writer of Rusesabagina's 2006 autobiography, ""An Ordinary Man."" ""I think he didn't want to embarrass Sabena. The idea of there being bloodstains in the lobby, on his watch, played a real factor in what he did.""
But according to some of the hotel's survivors, Rusesabagina also demonstrated a compassion that was seen hardly anywhere else in Rwanda during those 100 days. ""Nobody had been killed, injured, beaten, tortured, expelled or retrieved from the hotel during the whole time we were refugees,"" Thomas Kamilindi, a radio reporter who took refuge with his family at the Mille Collines, would write in a 2,000-word testimonial in 2005. ""Paul Rusesabagina managed to do the impossible to save our lives at the moment when others were massacring their own children, their own wives."" The writer Philip Gourevitch, who first brought the hotelier to public attention in his award-winning book about the genocide, ""We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed With Our Families,"" described Rusesabagina to me as ""a canny operator negotiating with the genocidaires, until everyone could be evacuated safely behind R.P.F. lines.""
Soon after the hotel's evacuation, the tide turned against the Hutu government. In July 1994, the Rwandan Patriotic Front, under the leadership of an officer in his mid-30s named Paul Kagame, declared that it had defeated the government army. Many genocidaires fled across the border into Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo); thousands of civilian refugees also escaped the country. Kagame soon became the de facto leader of the new Tutsi-dominated government, was eventually elected president and declared he would mend his country's divisions. His government eliminated ethnic identity as an official designation and removed it from the identity cards that played a key role in the genocide, and it created a community-based system of justice, known as gacaca courts, to try some crimes related to the genocide. Today Rwanda enjoys a prosperity and political stability that stands in sharp contrast to its turbulent, ethnically divided neighbors, Burundi and Congo.
Yet a group of Hutu-aligned critics outside the country have come to regard Kagame as a dictator, accusing his government of stifling dissent, assassinating enemies and even carrying out its own genocidal violence. And one of the most vocal critics - vexingly for Kagame and his allies - has been the celebrity protagonist of ""Hotel Rwanda,"" Paul Rusesabagina.
in december, I returned to Kigali for the first time in 15 years to find an entirely different city: an immaculate place of glass-and-steel high rises, crisply uniformed traffic police officers, median strips festooned with flowers. I had come to interview former associates of Rusesabagina about his arrest four months earlier, and I couldn't help feeling his reputation had been transformed almost as radically. At Chez Lando - a hotel and restaurant where, on the first day of the genocide, the Presidential Guard executed the owner, a Tutsi leader of the Liberal Party named Lando Ndasingwa, along with his wife, two teenage children and mother - I met up with Wellars Bizumuremyi, who was working the Mille Collines reception desk when I and the other correspondents checked in. His wife and two children, trapped at home when the massacres started, died at the hands of the Interahamwe. He was evacuated from the hotel in June, but he didn't learn their fate until the Rwandan Patriotic Front seized Kigali in July.
Bizumuremyi said he warmly welcomed Rusesabagina back to the Mille Collines in 2003, when the former hotelier accompanied the filmmaker Terry George on a research trip to the hotel. But when I asked him about the role that Rusesabagina played in 1994, he shook his head. ""He wasn't a hero,"" Bizumuremyi said. ""He didn't save anybody."" Those inside owed their survival to one dynamic, he maintained: the fear of reprisal and the ever-present threat that the Tutsi rebels in the Rwandan Patriotic Front might execute their Hutu hostages. Bizumuremyi had been delighted to see the images of his former boss being trotted out in handcuffs at a news conference organized by Rwandan authorities on Aug. 31, 2020. That was just days after his arrest - and less than six months before Rusesabagina would go on trial in Kigali, starting on Feb. 17. The nine charges against him include murder, abduction, armed robbery, arson, financing terrorism and being involved in the creation of an irregular armed group. ""Paul wanted to be president,"" he told me. ""After he received the medals and the celebrity, he thought he was as big as Paul Kagame. The film changed him.""
I tracked down others who endured the weeks in the Mille Collines, and I was struck by the consistency of their denunciations. Bernard Makuza, the current president of the Senate, told me that Rusesabagina extorted payments from guests - ""even though Sabena specifically said he was not to charge people,"" Makuza said. ""Paul made them pay. And Paul threatened those who couldn't pay with being thrown out of the hotel."" The film ""Hotel Rwanda,"" he said, was ""pure Hollywood fiction.""
A former manager at the Mille Collines, Freddy (he asked me to withhold his full name), maintained that he could not ""think of a single incident"" in which Rusesabagina saved lives. ""He was just a civilian. With what authority could he intervene?"" He repeated an accusation made by Makuza, that Rusesabagina cut off the hotel's running water in the last week of the siege. ""If you wanted to get water, you had to go down to the swimming pool one by one,"" he said. ""But there were military guys just outside who were trying to identify each person who came out of the room to get water."" He said that Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines, a privately owned, extremist media outlet unrelated to the hotel, would broadcast their names to the killers. ""They would say, 'Inside the Mille Collines there is this person and that person.' "" Taciana Rusesabagina says claims that her husband threatened to expel anyone who couldn't pay or that he shut off water to the hotel are lies.
The Rwandan government has sought to undermine Rusesabagina's reputation since at least 2006, when he turned decisively and publicly against Kagame. It was hard for me to judge whether these survivors were simply parroting government propaganda or whether the reports of Rusesabagina's supposed crimes had prompted them to revisit the past in a new light. Tom Zoellner, the co-author of Rusesabagina's autobiography, takes a cynical view, noting that these new denunciations closely echo the descriptions of Rusesabagina as a ""fraud"" and an ""impostor"" that appeared in the pro-government press in 2007, just after he emerged as a Kagame critic. ""All these people came out of the woodwork who never said anything before,"" Zoellner told me. ""This is the nature of a totalitarian society. It was textbook dictator messaging.""
No one can deny that Kagame, in the 26 years since he rose to power, has helped to rebuild Rwanda from the ruins. Millions have been lifted out of poverty; the nation's 73 percent literacy rate, according to the United Nations, represents an increase of 13 percent since the genocide, and petty corruption is nearly nonexistent. To me, having witnessed the genocide and its aftermath as part of decades of reporting in Africa, the country's transformation seems almost miraculous. As Andrew Mitchell, a British Conservative member of Parliament and a longtime Kagame ally, put it to me, the rulers have ""pulled the country back from utter barbarity, to a position where they have a working health care system, prosperity and development.""
Yet there's also no denying that the government's commitment to democracy and civil society has been tenuous. It has jailed journalists and opposition candidates; it has banned certain rival political parties that it claims foment ethnic division or deny the reality of the genocide - a crime in Rwanda. Kagame's government has been accused of orchestrating a series of deaths, between 1997 and 2014, of exiled dissidents in South Africa, Uganda, Belgium, Britain and Kenya. ""Anyone who remotely appears to be a popular or potential leader of some kind, anybody who can take away his shine, becomes a threat,"" says David Himbara, an economist who was Kagame's head of strategy and policy but who broke with him in 2009 and fled abroad, ending up in Canada. ""It's total control,"" he told me.
Pierre-Richard Prosper, an American lawyer who served as a war-crimes prosecutor for the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania, between 1996 and 1998, says that Kagame has had to navigate between opening the country to free expression and tamping down the ethnic hatreds that tore it apart. ""The international community expects that once you have an election, you are automatically a democracy, and that's not realistic. It's a journey, not a destination,"" Prosper told me. ""Especially when you are dealing with a country that's just come out of a genocide."" Paul Rusesabagina's alienation from the Tutsi-led government began to take hold soon after the genocide ended. Whether suspicious of his ties to the ancien régime or simply out of a desire to control everything, officials subjected Rusesabagina to petty harassment, searching through his baggage at the airport when he returned from trips to Belgium, according to his son Roger, a teenager at the time. A soldier once broke into his house, tried to steal his computer and threatened to shoot him. In 1996, the family resettled in Brussels, where Rusesabagina drove a taxi and started a small transport company. Among the community of Rwandan exiles in the city, there was a coterie of genocidaires and their supporters who embraced the ethnosupremacist ideology known before the genocide as Hutu Power, which called for Hutu to run Rwanda and remove Tutsi from public life.
In justifying such aims, these expatriates had convinced themselves that the new Kagame government was even worse than its critics imagined - that it, too, was carrying out genocidal violence. I happened to be present for the immediate aftermath of one incident they point to. In late April 1995, a year after the start of the genocide, I traveled to Kibeho, a town in Rwanda and the site of the largest of several camps set up by the French military in the region to protect displaced Hutu civilians. The Tutsi government had complained that the camps were sanctuaries for Hutu guerrillas, and earlier that April, troops had moved in to shut down Kibeho and return people to their villages. But as the soldiers began screening tens of thousands of them to identify those who had taken part in the genocide, some tried to flee. Gunfire broke out. According to some estimates, as many as 5,000 people were killed. (The Rwandan military said the number of deaths was about 300.) ""It was savagery,"" one U.N. peacekeeper told me, as I wrote at the time; we were standing beside the corpse of a woman who was trampled in the melee. A Red Cross official pleaded with a crowd gathered around him: ""You must resume your lives. The war is finished.""
The Kibeho tragedy became one of the seeds of a dark narrative that has only grown in force since then. Even when the genocide was unfolding, the station Radio Télévision Libre des Mille Collines was broadcasting that Hutu civilians were being killed by the Tutsi of the Rwandan Patriotic Front as they advanced through the country. Hutu hard-liners in exile began claiming that reprisal killings of Hutu equaled - or possibly exceeded - the murders of Tutsi but were covered up by the Kagame government. This conspiracy theory has become known as the ""double genocide"" view of Rwandan history.
This view has found support in work done for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. After the genocide, the United Nations dispatched Robert Gersony, a freelance conflict and human rights investigator with long experience in Africa, to determine whether conditions in Rwanda were safe enough for refugees (who were overwhelmingly Hutu) to return. In one of the regions he visited, Gersony and his team found that many Rwandans had already come home, and the situation appeared to be ""secure, stable and peaceful."" He collected evidence of arbitrary arrests, disappearances and physical abuse in another corner of the country. But when he visited an area in southern Rwanda declared off-limits by Rwandan Patriotic Front commanders, according to someone familiar with the investigation, he encountered depopulated villages; heard credible accounts of mass executions and killers going house to house; and observed scores of fresh corpses of men, women and children.
Gersony's team delivered to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees a 14-page summary of their findings that described ""systematic and sustained killing and persecution"" of Hutu civilians in the south. They estimated that as many as 35,000 people had been killed in the region. Alison Des Forges, the Rwanda expert for Human Rights Watch, came to accept the report. The United Nations, seemingly concerned that it might sabotage international support for the new government, never published Gersony's account, but within weeks its findings appeared in the press. Before long, though, according to Des Forges, the United Nations had successfully pressured the Rwandan government to get its commanders to stop the killings.
Gersony's report has been widely accepted, and its implications - summary killings by Tutsi government forces, tens of thousands of Hutu dead - are an outrage and a stain on Paul Kagame's legacy. But in subsequent years, the ""double genocide"" theory spiraled beyond all reason. Two American professors, Christian Davenport and Allan C. Stam, relied partly on pre-genocide census figures compiled by the hard-line Hutu regime - later characterized as shoddy by many critics - to argue that Hutu deaths had vastly outnumbered those of Tutsi. In a 2014 BBC documentary, ""Rwanda: The Untold Story,"" which led the Kagame regime to ban the network's broadcasts in Rwanda, Stam said, ""If a million people died in Rwanda in 1994, and that's certainly possible, there's no way that the majority of them could be Tutsi."" He estimated that the Tutsi death count could have been as low as 200,000.
Judi Rever, a Canadian journalist, claimed in a 2018 book that the R.P.F. massacred and then disposed of hundreds of thousands of Hutu in secrecy in 1994, both during and after the Tutsi genocide. ""It was mass murder leaving barely a trace,"" she wrote. Rever told me that in areas controlled by the R.P.F., S.S.-style ""mobile killing squads loaded Hutus onto trucks"" by the thousands, drove them into remote areas, killed them, burned the bodies and disposed of the remains. These brazen, or gullible, revisions of history found an eager audience among groups of Hutu extremists in exile, who were looking for ways to damage Kagame's credibility, to minimize Hutu culpability and, for some, to justify attempts to retake Rwanda by force.
Despite his exposure to these ideas, Rusesabagina's transformation into a vehement opponent of the government seems to have been a slow one. As late as 2003, he was donating money to Kagame's successful campaign for president in Rwanda's first multiparty election, and he even attended a rally for the president in Kigali, according to Odette Nyiramilimo, a former senator and one-time Rusesabagina confi dante, who had encouraged him to return to his homeland. Taciana Rusesabagina denies this, saying, ""He never would have donated money to Paul Kagame.""
But by 2006, Rusesabagina had joined a small group of Hutu exiles to found a new political party, P.D.R.-Ihumure. According to one account, there were hopes that he would eventually challenge Kagame for the presidency. Philip Gourevitch, who wrote sympathetically about Rusesabagina in his book, told me that the former hotelier was now ""more than a critic of Kagame. He was using his Hollywood-hyped reputation as a hero as cover while aligning himself with Hutu Power ideology.""
One of the most controversial questions surrounding Rusesabagina's activities during this time centers on the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (F.D.L.R.) - a rebel group based in the Democratic Republic of Congo whose fighters, among them former Hutu soldiers and Interahamwe, were carrying out many deadly attacks against Tutsi in Congo and Rwanda during the late 2000s. Rusesabagina's allies say categorically that he never had any affiliation with the group. Taciana told me that the rebel group ""hates Paul because he protected Tutsis during the genocide.""
But prosecutors claim to have evidence that Rusesabagina became personally involved with fund-raising and procuring arms for the group. The prosecutor-general's office told me that during the trial, it will produce emails from 2007 between Providence Rubingisa, an expatriate P.D.R. leader, and an F.D.L.R. field commander in Congo. In them, the party leader indicates that Rusesabagina is in direct contact with Ignace Murwanashyaka, the F.D.L.R.'s leader, and reassures the field commander of the party's backing: ""We are going to do mobilization so that we can start sending you the support at the end of December,"" he promises. (The emails are in Kinyarwanda, Rwanda's national language.) He goes on to say that he has informed Rusesabagina about ""the other equipment you've been asking for."" He adds, ""Please continue to update me on the news of the battlefield."" Other indications of Rusesabagina's involvement with the F.D.L.R. emerged in text messages from Murwanashyaka that were intercepted by German intelligence and submitted as evidence when, in 2011, Murwanashyaka went on trial in Stuttgart for war crimes.
By the mid-2000s, Rusesabagina was spending more time in the United States and cultivating a group of media advisers, politicians and academics to help him start his post-""Hotel Rwanda"" career as a human rights speaker, one who staked out peaceful, pro-democracy positions in public. One of the most active of these new advisers was Kurth, a media consultant and Democratic Party activist in Chicago who met him in 2007, while he was looking for help delivering a letter to former President Bill Clinton in support of an international truth and reconciliation commission in Rwanda. (The Rwandan government says that its internal system has already filled that role.) Kurth knew little about Rwanda before her association with Rusesabagina, she admits, but she soon came to share his hostility toward Kagame, blaming Kagame for ""lighting the fuse"" of the genocide by ""taking down the president's plane"" in April 1994.
Kurth brought in Brian Endless, director of the African studies and Africa diaspora program at Loyola University Chicago, as a senior adviser to the Hotel Rwanda Rusesabagina Foundation, a nonprofit set up to give assistance to orphans and widows in Rwanda. Endless, who has never visited Rwanda, told me that ""400,000 Tutsis and 600,000 Hutus"" died during the entire year of 1994 and argues that Kagame ""invented"" the ""Tutsi genocide."" He says he has arrived at these conclusions after meeting exiles, following court cases and studying reports by Allan C. Stam and other historical revisionists. ""It's the Rwandan government's goal to say, 'No Hutus were killed, only Tutsis,' "" Endless told me. ""It's creating a picture of Tutsi victims and Hutu oppression.""
Rusesabagina's most prominent ally in the United States has been Robert Krueger, a former U.S. representative and senator from Texas. In the early 1990s, Krueger served as the U.S. ambassador to Burundi, where a Tutsi military ruled over an oppressed Hutu majority and carried out several widespread massacres. The experience introduced Krueger to the violent ethnic politics of the African Great Lakes region and helped shape his antipathy toward the powerful Tutsi leader across the border; Krueger would later call Kagame ""the most murderous dictator in all Africa."" Kathleen Krueger, the ambassador's wife, recalled to me a 1995 visit she made to a refugee camp in Burundi for Hutu fleeing what they described as reprisal killings by the Rwandan Patriotic Front. ""It was a countergenocide,"" she told me, though she provided no evidence to support those claims.
Rusesabagina met Bob Krueger in 2007 after a referral from Oprah Winfrey, Kathleen Krueger says, and appeared with him at speaking engagements across the United States. Two years later, after a series of break-ins at his Brussels home - for which Rusesabagina blamed Kagame's agents - he and his wife relocated to San Antonio, near the Kruegers' home in New Braunfels. Together with Krueger, Rusesabagina portrayed Rwanda as a lawless dictatorship, in which extrajudicial executions and disappearances were commonplace, and advanced the double-genocide theory. ""Paul had begun to go after Kagame, in ways that I thought were really irrational,"" Zoellner says. ""He refused to see the nuanced picture of Kagame, as an iron-fisted authoritarian like Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia, who put a lid on the murderous currents in his society. I told him: 'Paul, you need to be more like Nelson Mandela. You are criticizing Kagame too hard.' ""
Rusesabagina articulated his position in a disjointed 2007 interview with Keith Harmon Snow, an American freelance journalist and self-described ""war crimes and genocide investigator."" He insinuated that Kagame was the culprit behind the assassination of President Habyarimana and agreed with Snow that one motivation for the murder was to provoke a wave of killing and depopulate the country of much of the Hutu majority. ""Who benefited from Habyarimana's death?"" Rusesabagina said. ""It is Kagame and his people."" He claimed that Tutsi fighters had infiltrated the Interahamwe militias and that some Hutu fighters ""were not aware that they"" - meaning the Interahamwe - were ""working for"" Kagame. ""Most of those guys who were just on the roadblocks were Kagame people."" Other victims, he argued, were randomly targeted by enraged civilians who had been displaced during incursions by the Rwandan Patriotic Front in the early 1990s. ""All those refugees who surrounded Kigali, who had been angry for four years, who had lost their family members, killed by the rebels - they started revenging on everyone,"" Hutu and Tutsi alike, he said. Kagame, he declared, ""is the one responsible for the death of a million people.""
Today the successors to the Hutu Power movement are spread across three continents - Africa, Europe and North America - and at least two generations. They include exiles and fugitives who served in the ancien régime, as well as some of their children. Adherents propagate the double-genocide story and claims of Kagame atrocities via Twitter feeds, Facebook pages and online-media sites. One prominent outlet is Jambonews. It was founded in 2010 in Brussels, and its contributors have included Donatien Nshimyumuremyi, whose father, Félicien Kabuga, reportedly was a top financier of the genocide; he spent a quarter of a century as a fugitive and is currently at The Hague, awaiting trial. Nshimyumuremyi, a data scientist based in Belgium, typifies the educated second generation of Rwandan expatriates who embrace and promote denialism. A website affiliated with the family proclaims his father's innocence and includes testimonials from prominent revisionists in Europe and the United States, including Keith Harmon Snow.
The Hutu Power exiles do far more than declare moral equivalence between the 1994 genocide and the supposed crimes carried out by the Kagame government. Some raise funds and provide other material support for the ragtag militias along the Rwandan border, who share their dream of replacing Kagame with a Hutu regime. Since 2017, their hopes have rested on the National Liberation Front (F.L.N.), a militia of a thousand or so men, based in bush camps in Burundi and Congo, that has been patched together from aging F.D.L.R. fighters and a new generation of disaffected Rwandan and Congolese youth. The rebel group is the armed wing of the Rwanda Movement for Democratic Change (M.R.C.D.), a Brussels-based coalition of parties in exile. There's no question, Keith Harmon Snow told me, that Rusesabagina ""supports an armed overthrow of the Rwandan government"" to stop what Snow calls ""the Kagame killing machine.""
In late 2018, Rusesabagina uploaded a YouTube video in English that declared the Rwandan Patriotic Front to be ""the enemy of the Rwandan people"" and pledged ""unreserved support"" for the National Liberation Front. The statement was especially shocking because the F.L.N. had just carried out a brutal attack inside Rwanda in June 2018. A group of armed men entered Nyabimata, a town near the Burundi border, and killed three people; six months later, guerrillas ambushed three buses traveling through the nearby Nyungwe Forest, killing at least six and injuring dozens. Around this time, Rusesabagina gave an interview to the Voice of America's Kinyarwanda service. ""Aren't you afraid that you will be arrested?"" the reporter asked. Rusesabagina replied: ""We are paying a lot of attention. We have passed difficult roads, and we will survive."" The interviewer asked if his forces were still encamped in the Nyungwe Forest. ""We are angry. We did not enter it to abandon it,"" Rusesabagina replied. He added, ""We are there to demand our rights as Rwandan natives.""
When I read these statements to Kitty Kurth and Brian Endless, they each questioned the accuracy of the translation. ""It doesn't sound like anything that Paul would say,"" Kurth told me. She acknowledged that, if true, it would be damning evidence of Rusesabagina's role in fomenting the insurgency. But Kurth later told me that the attack was probably ""a false flag"" operation staged by the Rwandan government to incriminate Rusesabagina. She insisted that ""even if the F.L.N. engaged in the alleged terrorist activities and attacks,"" Rusesabagina ""had no connection to or responsibility"" for them. Taciana Rusesabagina told me that the words were ""taken out of context by the Rwandan government.""
By 2019, the government was determined to capture Rusesabagina. Two violent attacks had taken place in Rwanda the year before, and according to the prosecution, Rusesabagina had seemed to endorse them publicly. This led the Belgian Federal Police to summon Rusesabagina - who kept his house outside Brussels after moving to Texas and lived there intermittently - for questioning. Two Rwandan investigators flew in from Kigali to observe. Rusesabagina, accompanied by a lawyer, refused to answer many questions. A few days later, according to Taciana, four police officers searched his home, seizing a laptop, smartphones and documents. ""They looked under the mattresses, everywhere,"" she told me. ""They went up to the attic and down into the garage.""
In Kigali, according to Prosecutor General Aimable Havugiyaremye, investigators analyzed WhatsApp messages between Rusesabagina and another person in which they discussed the 2018 attacks. ""Was that 'little thing' yours?"" the then unidentified correspondent had asked in Kinyarwanda, using an expression that connoted admiration. The correspondent was soon identified as Constantin Niyomwungere, and in early 2020, the police arrested the pastor on charges of abetting terrorism while he was visiting his churches in Rwanda. Niyomwungere, the prosecutor told me, expressed contrition under interrogation: ""He said he felt bad that his friend was committing crimes - killing innocent people and burning houses."" Niyomwungere insists that he was secretly outraged all along by Rusesabagina's role in the rebel attacks. ""Paul said, 'These are my guys, they had killed all those people in Rwanda,' "" he told me. ""When I discovered that Rusesabagina had carried out these terrorist activities, I was determined to help."" The prosecutor says that the pastor, to spare himself a jail sentence, offered to help set a trap.
Niyomwungere proposed telling Rusesabagina that he could escort him to meetings with F.L.N. leaders in Bujumbura and at camps in Cibitoke Province, near the Rwandan border. Havugiyaremye told me, ""He said, 'If you can hire a private jet, I can convince him that it was hired by the government of Burundi.' "" As Niyomwungere himself told me: ""I work with the authorities in Burundi. I know the government. I speak to the president."" The Rwandan government went along, and the Rwanda Investigation Bureau chartered the business jet from a longtime contractor with Kagame's government. (Rusesabagina and his family maintain that Niyomwungere invited him to speak at local churches.)
On Aug. 25, the day before Rusesabagina set off from San Antonio, Niyomwungere boarded a flight to Dubai. The prosecutor general's team viewed his departure with trepidation. ""We thought, What if this man is lying and wants to run away?"" Havugiyaremye told me. ""He said: 'I can assure you I will honor my promise. I have churches I want to run. I do disagree with what they did. Trust me.' So, we took that risk."" Rusesabagina and Niyomwungere rendezvoused as planned at the Ibis Styles hotel and then went to the airport. There was an anxious moment aboard the business jet, when a flight attendant announced that they would be heading ""to Kigali"" - but they were talking and ""he didn't hear it,"" the pastor told me. When Rusesabagina was whisked off to a Kigali jail cell, he thought Niyomwungere had been arrested, too; it was only several days later that he realized he had been betrayed.
Family and friends, as well as human rights groups, denounced Rusesabagina's detention as a ""kidnapping"" and an ""extraordinary rendition."" An American Bar Association Center for Human Rights background briefing released in January this year expressed concern about the lack of procedural safeguards surrounding his transfer to Rwanda, though the briefing made no conclusive judgments about whether it violated international law. Johnston Busingye, Rwanda's justice minister, maintains that his government was acting within its rights. ""If this man could dare do what he did, we had every right to go after him by any means necessary,"" he told me. ""We thought, If we could lure him into coming to Kigali, believing he was going somewhere else, and get him arrested at the airport, that would be wonderful.""
Rusesabagina is now being tried alongside 20 others who are accused of being F.L.N. organizers and combatants; the proceedings could last several months. The prosecution plans to present 80 victims of F.L.N. attacks, as well as three witnesses who are said to have worked alongside Rusesabagina, including Niyomwungere, who has been kept under watch for months in a hidden location. ""I am happy to testify against a terrorist, someone who killed people,"" he told me. ""He deceived me. I want to help justice."" In a brief courtroom appearance in September, Rusesabagina said the F.L.N. had broken from its initial mission of defending civilians under threat from the Rwandan Patriotic Front. He had nothing to do with the attacks, he insisted: ""I do not deny that the F.L.N. committed crimes, but my role was diplomacy."" Rusesabagina's attorney Gatera Gashabana has challenged the prosecution on procedural grounds, claiming his transfer was unlawful, but hasn't publicly indicated any other defense strategy before the trial's start. (Officials refused to grant me a meeting with Rusesabagina during my eight days in Rwanda in December, citing an outbreak of Covid-19 at the prison.)
Rwandan prosecutors are hoping to prove that Rusesabagina was a major force in the rebel movement, but just how much influence he wielded is open to question. According to emails provided by the prosecution, the Rwandan exiles who backed the F.D.L.R. seem to have regarded him as a useful pawn at first - a celebrity who could lobby Washington, raise money and propagate their ideology on his speaking tours under the cover of his heroism. But over time, prosecutors claim, he took on more of a hands-on role. In the pastor's telling, he was deeply involved in F.L.N. planning and logistics. One rebel leader on trial with Rusesabagina has referred to him in court as his ""boss.""
Whatever Rusesabagina's level of involvement, the F.L.N.'s ragtag guerrillas have never constituted a serious threat. But the Kagame regime, made up of many former guerrillas of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, knows from experience the dangers of letting a rebel movement fester along its borders. And despite continuous attempts over two decades to reintegrate the Hutu guerrillas, the insurgency has still not been defeated. Theogene Rudasingwa, a former field doctor with the Rwandan Patriotic Front and former Rwandan ambassador to the United States, who turned against Kagame and fled the country in the early 2000s, told me that he considered Kagame to be a ""violent and insecure"" dictator. But the alternative presented by Rusesabagina and his ilk, he said, was far worse: ""I would rather have Kagame in power than these miserable groups like the F.L.N.""
One sunny afternoon in mid-December, I met Odette Nyiramilimo, the Rwandan senator and former close friend of Paul Rusesabagina, at the outdoor bar at the Hotel des Mille Collines. In late April 1994, a sympathetic major in the Rwandan police who was bunked at the hotel rescued Nyiramilimo, her husband and their four children from their home in Kigali. ""It wasn't Paul himself who came for me, but he did find someone who did,"" she told me. We were sitting beside the swimming pool in the rear garden that provided water for the hotel's occupants after someone cut off the water supply during the last weeks of the siege. ""Paul didn't do that,"" she told me. ""How could he have done it?"" She strongly denied the frequently repeated claims that Rusesabagina threatened to evict refugees who couldn't pay their bills. He had moved some nonpaying guests to cots in the restaurant and elsewhere on the first floor, she said, but ""I never saw him threaten to expel people from the hotel if they didn't pay up - never.""
Nyiramilimo was cautiously challenging the revisionist view of Rusesabagina that the government has taken such pains to propagate. ""He was very humane,"" she said. ""He took care of his friends."" She described how he would ply Hutu government ministers with ""food, wine and Champagne"" in his hotel room and how he elected to stay behind after the first evacuation ""to negotiate for the others."" At the same time, Nyiramilimo insisted that others had played a role in protecting those inside the Mille Collines and that Rusesabagina ""was no hero.""
We walked up to the second floor and down a narrow corridor, which was dimly lit, with low ceilings and a scuffed orange carpet - little had changed outwardly since I stayed here in 1994. Nyiramilimo stopped before Room 226. ""We were all in this suite, my husband and I and four kids, and another family with four kids, and another one who had three kids - 20 of us,"" she recalled. ""Paul brought in three mattresses, and everybody slept together, women on one side, men on the other."" Their days were filled with boredom, she said, interspersed with moments of terror. Sometimes Nyiramilimo would venture down the corridor and peer out a window that overlooked the parking lot and the road beyond. ""I could see the Interahamwe in the streets, though I was terrified to look at them,"" she said. I asked her if she believed that everyone in the hotel would have been killed if Rusesabagina hadn't been there. ""It's possible,"" she allowed.
But her respect and affection for Rusesabagina was now gone, replaced by contempt. Their friendship began to sour in April 2005, she told me, when Rusesabagina abruptly canceled his plan to fly to Kigali from Brussels to attend the national premiere of ""Hotel Rwanda"" at the InterContinental Hotel alongside Kagame, Terry George and other Mille Collines survivors. He claimed that he feared for his life because he had been denouncing the president in news conferences. ""I said: 'You're crazy, why would the president want to kill you? Are you dreaming?' "" she told me. ""And that was when he started with this revisionism of the genocide.""
Their last conversation took place some months later - a phone call in which he urged her to join his anti-Kagame movement. ""He said, 'There are things that are being prepared.' I said: 'What are you talking about? I get the feeling that you're trying to overthrow the government.' And that was the end. I never even talked again to his wife, Taciana, who was my best friend for years.""
Nyiramilimo remains fiercely loyal to Kagame: He lifted Rwanda out of a nightmare, she told me, and brought stability and justice to a broken nation. In the end, she said, Rusesabagina had been brought down by hubris - his deluded conviction that it was he, not Kagame, who could heal Rwanda. ""It was folie de grandeur' she told me, as we left the Mille Collines. ""After he became famous, everyone was telling him, 'Paul, you could be president.' "" He really came to the idea that he had saved those 1,300 people, she said. ""He really wanted to be the star.""

'PAUL WANTED TO BE PRESIDENT. AFTER HE RECEIVE THE MEDALS AND THE CELEBRITY, HE THOUGHT HE WAS AS BIG AS PAUL KAGAME. THE FILM CHANGED HIM.'

NHL Bars Olympic Participation
Jonah Tolbert, Staff Writer|February 28, 2022
Diana Jakovcevic
Hockey in the Olympics has been at a disadvantage compared to basketball. Basketball is in the summer, which means that as the NBA season gets over in mid-June and the Olympics are in July, the athletes are primed for peak international performance. The NHL season is from October to June and the Winter Olympics are in February. Because of this, the NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has only authorized his athlete’s’ attendance at the Olympics five times from 1998 to 2018. Many NHL players were planning to go to the 2022 Olympics as there was a three week break originally allotted for their time to play overseas. However, COVID-19 remained a concern for Bettman. If a player became infected, they would have to stay in Beijing for three weeks,  affecting the NHL season. Therefore, Bettman prohibited his players from attending the 2022 Winter Games.
When people hear about college players in the Olympics, they think of the “Miracle on Ice” in 1980, when the Americans shocked the heavy favorites, the Soviet Union, to win. The American Olympic Team had just two months to put a team together.
       In 1980, the tension between the U.S.A and Russia came because of their disagreements over the Cold War, and the two teams were therefore on strict lockdown. This year, the teams are in a lockdown of a different sort, but the teams still mostly stay inside their dorm, and leave only for practice and games. 
Because there are no NHL players, many spectators may not recognize the college athletes they are watching, unless they are a University of Minnesota or Boston College hockey fan. With those schools having the majority of the players, it would have been awesome to have Austin Matthews, who was projected to become captain of the USA team. Instead, we had Andy Miele as our captain.
The team was ready to go. In the stage group they faced off against Canada, China, and Germany. First, they played China and won in an 8-0 blowout— - there wasn’t really a question about the team’s skill. Canada has won the Olympics for men’s ice hockey in 2002, 2010, and 2014. This game could have been a blowout because all of Canada’s players were juniors. It ended up being a thrilling game. The USA took the first goal and ended up winning the game 4-2. The USA faced Germany next, and had the lead for most of the game. A late surge was mounted by Germany, but a final goal gave the USA a 3-2 victory.
       The USA needed three games to win it all. After seeing the USA win the group, there seemed to be high hopes for the Americans. The quarterfinal was against Slovakia, and USA once again held the lead for the whole game. In the last minute, Slovakia pulled their goalie and tied the game. Overtime had the teams neck and neck, and the game went to a shootout.  Each team gets five tries to score, and the first goals were blocked by the goalies. Then Slovakia got a goal off. So the USA needed this goal and then blocked the next one, so they lost. The real hope is for 2026, because the NHL says they want to have U.S. player in the Olympics. The return of NHL players to the Olympics in 2026 will be a boon for ratings, especially with TNT and ESPN owning the broadcasting rights. This extra boost might be needed,  as it stands this was the lowest-rated Olympics since 1988.

948,"This is by no means the finished product for the New Orleans Saints. Good thing. Drew Brees and the New Orleans offense got off to a sluggish start in what was as close to a gimme game as there is in this year’s playoffs, and they know they’ll need to do better in the coming weeks. Starting with next Sunday’s divisional game against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers (6:40 p.m., ET, Fox). “Definitely not the best game we’ve had offensively,” said Deonte Harris, whose 17-yard grab on third-and-8 in the first quarter set up New Orleans’ first touchdown. “But it was good enough to get the job done.” Lopsided as the 21-9 final score was, the win over the Chicago Bears wasn’t even that close. Not that anyone expected much different. The Bears were an 8-8 team that backed into the playoffs, was short-handed and could be on the verge of a significant housecleaning. Only the most optimistic of Chicago fans had hopes of subduing Brees and the Saints in the Superdome. But it still took Brees and the offense until the third quarter before they found their groove, erupting for two touchdowns and 211 yards in the last 26 minutes. Brees also was stopped inches short of the goal line on what would have been a third score with a little over 2 minutes left in the game. More: Opinion: NFL playoff win over Washington best example of why Tampa Bay wanted Tom Brady More: Chicago Bears WR Anthony Miller gets ejected after exchange of words with CJ Gardner-Johnson Maybe this was the result of the COVID-19 outbreak that kept Alvin Kamara out of last week’s game and practice this week. Or the fact this was the first game for both Michael Thomas (ankle) and Harris (neck) in almost a month. Whatever the reasons, the Saints didn’t start the game with the kind of urgency and crispness the playoffs demand. “Listen, we’ve got some work to do,” Brees said. “This is playoff football. Each game becomes, obviously, more meaningful and we’ve got to continue to (improve). We need to improve. We still need to improve. There’s still room for that. “That’s what this week is going to be focused on.” There is no doubt they will. Brees and Brady are future Hall of Famers. First-balloters, no less. Whenever they go up against each other, it’s special, and sharing space in the NFC South now that Brady is in Tampa Bay doesn’t diminish that one bit. Yes, the Saints beat the Bucs in each of the two regular-season meetings. Handily so. But the lack of an off-season hurt Brady and the Buccaneers more than any other team, perhaps, and it wasn’t until the final month of the season that you began to see their true potential. Plus, Brady does the playoffs as well as anyone. Just look at his six Super Bowl rings. “I don’t take it for granted. I’m very appreciative of the opportunity,” Brees said. “The minute he signed with the Bucs and came to the division, I felt that was going to be a team to contend with and a team that had (Super Bowl) ambitions. Like us.” Should the Saints beat the Buccaneers, a potential meeting looms with Aaron Rodgers and the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field in the NFC Championship. New Orleans has the talent, the depth and the experience to beat either of those teams. But only if it plays to its full potential. Which it didn’t against the Bears. Chicago is a mediocre team even when at full strength, and the Bears were far from that Sunday. They were playing without linebacker Roquan Smith, cornerbacks Buster Skrine and Jaylon Johnson and wide receiver Darnell Mooney, who has been one of Chicago’s most productive players in recent weeks. Yet at halftime, the score was 7-3. The defense was smothering Mitchell Trubisky and the Bears, but the Saints were sputtering. After Brees connected with Thomas on his first touchdown in more than a year, Wil Lutz missed a 50-yard field goal and the Saints turned the ball over on a fumble – which led to Chicago’s field goal. The Saints didn’t get farther than the Chicago 49 the rest of the half. “I’d have to look at the tape to see if it was rhythm driven,” coach Sean Payton said. “We shot ourselves in the foot on a few early downs. I think those are things we can clean up and correct.” The Saints faced a similar situation before their second game against Brady and the Bucs. Short-handed, they needed overtime to beat the Bears the week before. But they promised then that they would clean things up and, sure enough, they walloped the Buccaneers 38-3 in Tampa Bay. It might seem nit-picky to criticize the Saints after a playoff win. One in which the defense set a franchise record by holding the Bears to nine points, no less. But Brees is celebrating his 42nd birthday this week, and it’s not lost on anyone that time is running out. He and the Saints need to make the most of every play, every possession, every game. And they’re not there. Not yet, anyway. Follow USA TODAY Sports columnist Nancy Armour on Twitter @nrarmour.

949,"LAKELAND, Fla. — Finally, Major League Baseball's lockout is over.
MLB and the MLB Players Association agreed to a collective bargaining agreement Thursday, sources with knowledge of the players' vote told the Free Press, settling disputes about the minimum salary, a bonus pool for pre-arbitration-eligible players, the competitive balance tax, a draft lottery and an expanded postseason.
MLB owners ratified  the new CBA by a unanimous vote on Thursday night, with free agency beginning soon after the official lifting of the lockout at 7 p.m..
After three months of waiting, players on the Tigers' 40-man roster are allowed to show up to the spring training facility in Lakeland and can communicate with the organization's employees, such as general manager Al Avila, manager AJ Hinch and pitching coach Chris Fetter.
Spring training games are scheduled to begin March 18.
That's when the Phillies will arrive  for a 1:05 p.m. matchup with the Tigers at Joker Marchant Stadium to start Grapefruit League play. Detroit is currently slated for 12 spring training games, including one split squad.
The Tigers and White Sox are set to meet April 8 for Opening Day at Comerica Park.
These are five things the Tigers need to do, right now:
Get everyone to camp
The Tigers have many players on the 40-man roster residing outside of the United States.
For example, left-handed closer Gregory Soto and third baseman Jeimer Candelario are in the Dominican Republic; second baseman Jonathan Schoop is in Curaçao; outfielder Victor Reyes is in Venezuela; and infielder Isaac Paredes is in Mexico.
It's unclear whether these players are in the United States or a different country: right-hander Jose Cisnero, righty Angel De Jesus, left-hander Miguel Del Pozo, righty Rony Garcia and righty Elvin Rodriguez.
The CDC requires all persons entering the United States via air travel — U.S. citizens, legal permanent residents and special visa holders included — to present a negative COVID-19 test result taken no more than one day before departure, or proof of recovery from the virus within the last 90 days. The order does not apply to U.S. territories, such as  Puerto Rico.
If a player who isn't in the U.S. tests positive for the virus, their arrival to spring training will be significantly delayed.
Miguel Cabrera has been training in Florida, and so has left-hander Eduardo Rodriguez.Javier Baez spent his offseason in Puerto Rico.
Sign starting pitcher
The Tigers signed Rodriguez to a five-year, $77 million contract before the lockout, but the organization needs another arm to bolster its starting rotation.
For now, the crew features Rodriguez, right-hander Casey Mize, left-hander Tarik Skubal and righty Matt Manning. Lefty Tyler Alexander could be in the mix for a starting role, though he fits better as a long reliever and spot starter.
Regardless of Alexander's role, adding another starting pitcher — likely a veteran on a short-term deal — is of the utmost importance. Before the lockout, the Tigers compiled a favorites list of pitchers on the open market.
Some names to watch: left-hander Tyler Anderson, right-hander Michael Pineda and righty Garrett Richards.
Before the lockout, the Tigers expressed interest in Anderson. The 32-year-old registered a 4.53 ERA with 38 walks and 134 strikeouts over 167 innings in 31 starts for the Pirates and Mariners last season.
The Tigers are not expected to bid for lefty Carlos Rodon.
Or make a trade
The Athletics and Reds were open to trading players before the lockout, and the plan to dump payroll shouldn't be any different coming out of baseball's transaction freeze.
""Going into 2022, we must align our payroll to our resources and continue focusing on scouting and developing young talent from within our system,"" Reds general manager Nick Kroll said after trading catcher Tucker Barnhart (and his $7.5 million team option in 2022) to the Tigers in early November.
Could the Tigers make a post-lockout trade with the Reds or A's?
Keep tabs on these six starting pitchers: right-hander Sonny Gray ($10.2 million in 2022, $12 million team option in 2023), right-hander Luis Castillo (free agent after 2023), right-hander Tyler Mahle (free agent after 2023), left-hander Sean Manaea (free agent after 2022), right-hander Chris Bassitt (free agent after 2022), right-hander Frankie Montas (free agent after 2023).
The Tigers aren't ready to trade top prospects, though a small group of mid-tier prospects could be dealt. Avila will consider trade offers, but his organization won't be overly aggressive on this front unless an oaligns with the team's long-term plan.
What about a reliever?
The Tigers' bullpen looks solid entering 2022.
Soto is lined up as the closer, followed by a slew of right-handers: Cisnero, Michael Fulmer, Kyle Funkhouser, Alex Lange, Joe Jimenez and Jason Foley. Assuming Alexander doesn't make the rotation, the left-hander will serve as the primary long reliever.
But the Tigers need to think about upgrading the bullpen if they want to increase their chances of making the postseason. Left-hander Andrew Chafin or right-hander Collin McHugh would provide a massive boost.
Last season, Chafin logged a 1.83 ERA with 19 walks and 64 strikeouts over 682/3 innings for the Cubs and Athletics. The Tigers only have one left-hander in the back end of the bullpen, so pursuing Chafin makes sense.
McHugh had a 1.55 ERA for the Rays in 2021, posting 12 walks and 74 strikeouts in 64 innings over 37 games (seven starts). He played for the Astros from 2014-19, so he has a relationship with Hinch.
Although McHugh is a righty, his versatility is valuable.
Take care of contracts
Back in November, the Tigers tendered contracts to eight arbitration-eligible players for the 2022 season: Candelario, Cisnero, Reyes, Fulmer, Jimenez, right-hander Spencer Turnbull, catcher Dustin Garneau and utility player Harold Castro.
Those eight players will cost the Tigers roughly $20.9 million, estimated by a model from MLB Trade Rumors. Although the lockout has ended, these arbitration deals probably won't start trickling in for two or three weeks.
Candelario is projected to earn $5.9 million, Fulmer $5.1 million, Cisnero $1.9 million, Jimenez $1.8 million, Turnbull $1.8 million, Garneau $1.6 million, Castro $1.5 million and Reyes $1.3 million.",What Tigers need to do with lockout over
952,"Apr. 6Even though it happens a lot more than you think and way more than it should, it was still a big deal. The Phillies improved to 4-0 Monday night at Citizens Bank Park by beating the New York Mets in a game started by Jacob deGrom.
Good luck is about the only advice a manager and a hitting coach can offer ahead of sending their guys out to face deGrom, who with seemingly little effort and remarkable consistency pumps triple-digit fastballs into pinpoint locations.
Phillies rally past Mets, 5-3, after Jacob deGrom's early exit
""The best thing I can tell you is to just grind out at-bats the best you can,"" Phillies manager Joe Girardi said before the game. ""I think you have to be ready to hit his fastball because it's that good. He doesn't make a lot of mistakes, and when he does, you have to capitalize on it.
""But there is no extended plan on how to beat him. The best plan to try to beat him is probably to try to get him into long counts and tire him out, and that's not easy to do because he has so many swing-and-miss pitches.""
Very few teams beat deGrom, and yet the Mets still find a way to lose more than they win when the best pitcher on the planet takes the mound. They did so again Monday against the Phillies even though deGrom was at the top of his game in the Mets' season opener.
The Phillies won, 5-3, by rallying for five runs in the bottom of the eighth inning against a couple of New York relievers. Remarkably, the loss dropped the Mets to 36-41 in games started by deGrom since 2018 even though he has a 2.07 ERA in 77 starts and has won two NL Cy Young Awards during that span.
""I don't know how that is even possible,"" Phillies reliever Brandon Kintzler said. ""The game is hard. That shows that it is hard. It doesn't matter who is on the mound. That guy can't go nine every time, which is why bullpens are so important.""
The Phillies might not go undefeated, but they are much better than the last time they started 4-0  David Murphy
The bullpens meant everything in this game.
Kintzler, in fact, deserved credit for a save of sorts even though his 1 2/3 innings of work came in the top of the fourth and fifth. After the Mets took advantage of two walks and three singles to score twice in the fourth off lefty Matt Moore in his Phillies debut, Girardi called in Kintzler to face Kevin Pillar with one out and the bases loaded. The former Chicago Cubs and Miami Marlins closer threw four straight sinkers, and the fourth was right at Pillar's knees. The New York center fielder grounded into a 6-4-3 double play, and the Phillies were still close even though they were not doing any damage against deGrom.
Sam Coonrod, in his Phillies debut, pitched two scoreless innings and struck out three and rookie Connor Brogdon followed with a scoreless eighth, extending the bullpen's scoreless streak to a dozen innings to start the season. Brogdon got his second win of the young season.
To the Phillies' delight, Mets manager Luis Rojas removed deGrom after six innings and 77 pitches. Rojas said he wanted to be cautious because deGrom had not pitched in 10 days, a result of the Mets' delayed start to the season after the Washington Nationals had a COVID-19 outbreak last week.
""We were happy as a team, of course, getting one of the best pitchers in the entire world out of the game,"" Phillies right fielder Bryce Harper said.
The storylines that will shape the next chapter of the Phillies-Mets rivalry  Scott Lauber
It showed. After failing to score in the seventh off Miguel Rojas, the Phillies finally got things going in the eighth when Brad Miller got a pinch-hit single off Trevor May, a one-time prospect in the Phillies' farm system. After Andrew McCutchen battled his way on with an eight-pitch walk, Rhys Hoskins lined a 2-2 sinker into right field for a single that loaded the bases with one out.
Rojas called on Aaron Loup to face Harper, but that lefty-on-lefty strategy backfired. Loup hit Harper with a curveball to force in a run, and the Mets, thanks to the three-batter-minimum rule, were stuck with Loup against the right-handed hitting J.T. Realmuto, who jumped on a first-pitch cutter for a game-tying single to left field.
DeGrom was left with his 63rd no-decision in 184 career starts. The Mets fell to 26-37 in those no-decisions, and this cruel twist of fate came when Alec Bohm hit a grounder to third baseman Luis Guillorme, who had entered the game as a defensive replacement in the bottom of the eighth. Guillorme fielded the ball fine and made the right decision to throw home in an attempt to cut off the go-ahead run. But his throw sailed away from catcher James McCann, allowing Hoskins and Harper to score.
Jose Alvarado came on in the ninth and gave up a run before nailing down the save, and the Phillies had another impressive win while sticking the rival Mets with a debilitating season-opening loss in which they wasted another brilliant effort from the best pitcher on the planet.
",Bob Brookover: Jacob deGrom's early exit gave the Phillies a fighting chance for a comeback
953,"Apr. 22 - DETROIT  -  On a chilly, 42-degree night, after losing 10 pounds and more than two weeks to the COVID-19 virus, Tigers right-hander Spencer Turnbull needed just one inning to shake off the rust in his 2021 debut.
Turnbull, who got put in COVID-19 protocol after his last spring training start on March 10, gave up a two-out, RBI double to Erik Gonzalez in the first inning of Game 2 Wednesday night.
Then he got busy.
Turnbull ended up breezing through five innings, allowing two hits and striking out six to help the Tigers earn a split of the doubleheader and snap a five-game losing skid with a 5-2 win over the Pirates.
""First inning was a little rough, but I felt like I was rolling after that,"" Turnbull said. ""I was happy with it. It's always great fun to get a win.""
Turnbull dispatched 13 of the last 14 hitters he faced and he was lobbying to go back out for the sixth inning.
""The way he got into the game, giving up a few runners, high pitch-count (22) in inning one, and for him to make the adjustment and settle in,"" manager AJ Hinch said. ""He was strong enough to go out for the sixth.""
But the Tigers offense broke the game open with a three-run fifth inning. Turnbull's longest rehab outing at the alternate site was 4.1 innings and he was at 62 pitches after five.
""I just didn't want to have him sit for 30-35 minutes,"" Hinch said. ""But he could've given us a little more. I was really happy how he bounced back after that first inning.""
He blew threw the last four innings in 40 pitches, including a five-pitch fifth. Turnbull became the first pitcher in the big leagues this season to allow a run or fewer in five innings while throwing 62 pitches or less.
It's been done just nine times in Tigers' history, the last by Jordan Zimmermann, July 29, 2019.
""I haven't known Spencer that long,"" Hinch said. ""But he seems to have a calm heartbeat in the middle of the competition. That's what I'm learning about him. He can take some feedback.""
Turnbull started spotting his four-seam fastball (93-95 mph) better after the first, but his money pitch this night was his slider. He threw 21 of them, only three were put in play with an average exit velocity of 68.7 mph. He got six swings-and-misses on 12 swings with the slider.
""That pitch was really flat in Toledo last week,"" Turnbull said. ""But I figured something out with my hip load, I wasn't quite getting to the top of my delivery and that's where my power and load comes from and usually the spin is there when I'm doing that properly.""
Which he was from the minute he struck out Gregory Polanco with a slider to end the first with two runners on.
""That was really a go-to pitch for him,"" Hinch said. ""Seeing those funky swings from left-handed hitters and right-handed hitters tells me is was what it needs to do.""
Turnbull ended his night in style, too. He struck out Pirates lead-off hitter Adam Frazier on three pitches  -  a 94-mph fastball, 77-mph curve and 84-mph slider.
The only question was, would the Tigers get him any offense. They'd managed three hits in a 3-2 loss in Game 1, and they weren't exactly jumping all over Pirates right-hander Miguel Yajure early in the nightcap.
They didn't get on the board until the third inning when Niko Goodrum ambushed a first-pitch fastball (90 mph) and sent it into the visitors' bullpen in left-center field. It was his second homer of the year, his first batting left-handed, and the ball left his bat with an exit velocity of 105.7 mph.
""We needed that,"" Hinch said. ""We needed somebody to give us a spark.""
Jonathan Schoop, who hadn't had an extra-base hit all season, opened the fifth inning by pole-axing a change-up 403 feet into the left-field seats. The ball left his bat with an exit velocity of 106 mph.
""There was a three and a half-, four-week build-up of frustration that was taken out on that ball that went out to left field,"" Hinch said. ""But he's been trending toward feeling better lately, doing a ton of work. I know he wanted to see some results. That was a big swing.""
Hinch, wanting to force more action in the fifth, gave Goodrum the steal sign at first base with one out and slumping rookie Akil Baddoo at the plate. It was technically a run-and-hit, and Baddoo, in an 0-for-15 skid, scored Goodrum from first with a double.
Willi Castro, who had two hits in the nightcap, singled home Baddoo to cap the three-run fifth inning. Harold Castro drove in the fifth run with a two-strike single in the sixth.
Right-hander Bryan Garcia worked the sixth inning and yielded a 419-foot home run to the first batter he faced, Phillip Evans. It was just the second homer Garcia has allowed in his young career.
Gregory Soto, dropping 98- and 99-mph sinkers, struck out two in a clean seventh to earn the save.
Hinch had shifted his defense for the ninth inning. He moved Goodrum from left field to shortstop. He moved Willi Castro from shortstop to second base and Harold Castro from second to first.
He did all that for one reason.
""I had (center fielder) Derek Hill for one day and I wanted to make sure that sucker was in center field roaming that big outfield out there,"" Hinch said. ""I trust my players. I trust Niko to be ready. I got four or five guys moving around for one guy. To get Derek Hill out there.
""That versatility I've been talking about since I got here paid off.""
Hill was up as the 27th man for the double-header. He was returned to the alternate site following the game.

",Bullish: The return of Spencer Turnbull helps Tigers snap 5-game skid
956,"FARMINGTON — San Juan Regional Medical Center is set to receive a 20-person team of military healthcare providers as the hospital's critical care patient count has been pushing more than 220 percent of capacity for weeks.
The hospital was two patients away last week from tying its record number of COVID-19 patient count.
A U.S. Navy team of 20 military medical personnel is set to arrive at the Farmington hospital on Dec. 5, according to a military news release and the Associated Press.
The team is comprised of medical doctors, respiratory therapists and nurses.
Emergency Physician and Medical Director of Emergency Preparedness Dr. Brad Greenberg told The Daily Times the extra teams of healthcare workers the hospital has hosted have been solely needed.
The hospital is on its third Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT) from the United States Department of Health and Human Services National Disaster Medical System.
The Navy team will take over for the DMAT staff when they leave.
The hospital had upward of 70 extra health care workers in early November, when it declared crisis standards of care.
Greenberg said the Farmington hospital has the biggest critical care challenge of all the hospitals in New Mexico.
He added the hospital's census of critical care patients has been pushing more than 220 percent of capacity for weeks.
The critical care census was 236 percent of capacity on Dec. 1, according to Greenberg.
The hospital has 33 critically ill patients with 27 of those patients on a ventilator.
The regular ICU houses 14 patients, which has to be expanded as the number of critically ill patients increases, according to Greenberg.
""What that means is that the complexity of the cases, and the severity of the illness is very high,"" Greenberg said. ""And that means that it takes a lot of very highly skilled, highly trained people to care for these folks.""
He added he is proud of the work of the hospital's employees, as they have been rising to the challenge of the current COVID-19 surge of patients.
Greenberg urged the community to engage in COVID-19 safe practices and obtain a COVID-19 vaccination in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus.
Greenburg said he wishes people would take to heart that how we do as a community is the sum of an individual's choices.
Statewide, 84.1 percent of COVID-19 hospitalizations were from unvaccinated patients along with 89.3 percent of deaths tied to COVID-19 from Feb. 1 to Nov. 29, according to New Mexico Department of Health.
Near record COVID-19 patient admissions
The Farmington hospital had 94 patients on Dec. 1, near the recent high of 98 patients on Nov. 23, according to data provided by the hospital.
San Juan Regional's highest COVID-19 patient count was 100 on Dec. 30, 2020, according to hospital spokesperson Laura Werbner.
It comes as San Juan County had the largest rate of hospital admissions per 100,000 people for Nov. 15 through the 21, according to the New Mexico Department of Health.
The rate of 55.9 patients per 100,000 was the highest, with McKinley County in second with 33.1 patients per 100,000.
San Juan County fell to second place for the week of Nov. 22 through the 28th.
San Juan had a rate of 43.8 hospital admissions per 100,000 with De Baca County leading with 73.8 hospital admissions per 100,000.

957,"In the early spring of 2020, the same question was on everyone's lips: Just how weird would the ""new normal"" of their pandemic daily lives get? Turns out, pretty weird. It was a year of face masking. Empty movie theaters. Shivering at outdoor restaurant tables. Temperature checks at hair salons. Watching church services from your sofa. Eerily quiet, spectator-less sports. A shrunken social life with your tiny pod.
There were canceled weddings, drive-through graduations and scuttled vacations. Parents stuck at home juggled remote work and their kids' remote learning.
This spring, with vaccines being pumped into more Kentuckians' arms every day, there's a new question: When will the daily restrictions and distancing end? When will the now-cliche ""new normal"" return to the ""old normal?""
If you ask public health experts and business owners, you get a lot of references to crystal balls and Nostradamus.
Long story short: Nobody is certain.
Fully dialing back social distancing mandates impacting bars, churches, concerts and sports will depend on a complex mix of factors: Infection and hospitalization rates, vaccination rates, the unpredictable impact of emerging virus variants and whether people have the patience to continue social distancing in the critical coming months.
But, with plenty of caveats, some expect restrictions to ease significantly over the next six months. Already, five states including Texas have said they will remove mask mandates, a move that has alarmed some public health experts who say it's too soon.
Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious-disease doctor, has predicted the country could be ""approaching a degree of normality"" by the fall.
The consulting firm McKinsey predicts a ""transition toward normalcy"" in the second quarter of 2021, with herd immunity in the third or fourth quarters — with the chance that new variants and vaccine delays could push back those timelines.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear hasn't set specific thresholds for easing mandates, but with cases and the positivity rate declining, he recently raised capacity restrictions on businesses to 60% said he hopes all residents who want vaccines will have them by summer.
President Joe Biden now says there will enough vaccines for all adults by the end of May.
""Most likely the amount of time that we're still asked to wear masks and social distance is now limited, and we are moving every day closer and closer to getting back to something of an old normal, even though the world's going to be different moving forward,"" Beshear said.
A slow creep toward normality
Already there are a growing number of promising signs pointing in that direction — beyond daily infection counts or positivity rates.
Most Kentucky school districts will return this spring with distancing measures.
Spectator sports are creeping back. The Louisville Bats baseball team, for example, is set to open its season in April with distanced seating. College basketball tourneys will have some actual fans.
The first concert in the Louisville area in nearly a year was held in February at Freedom Hall, with tickets sold in small pods.
That same month, Beshear eased restrictions on visitations at some long-term care facilities such as assisted-living homes.
Even state judicial courts have begun easing restrictions, with long-delayed jury trials set to resume in May.
Even so, things may be slow to reach a type of normal we last saw in 2019.
""By the end of 2021, my prediction is we'll be back in a much more normal — and I use normal in quotes — living,"" said Donna Arnett, dean of the University of Kentucky College of Public Health. ""My expectation is that the first move will be for people to start interacting with other people"" outside their small bubble.
But ""some things are going to permanently change"" such as people being allowed to work remotely or some still wearing masks in tight areas such as gyms and airplanes.
Looking forward to a return
of 'music and beer'
Kentucky restaurants and bars were able to reopen their indoor services at 50% capacity starting Dec. 14. Warmer weather will expand outdoor offerings, and many are looking ahead to getting back to full capacity sometime this year.
Isaiah King was delayed a year from opening his Gasper Brewing Co., a brewery and yoga studio in Bowling Green, and finally was set to do so in late February. He's requiring staff to get vaccinated as soon as possible and hopes restrictions are lifted as vaccinations spread.
""Ideally, by summer we'll see the return of music and beer,"" he said. ""But we'll be masking and social distancing for the foreseeable future, probably into fall.""
Schools opening this year will be very different, with distancing measures that could extend into fall, like two kids at a cafeteria table meant for eight, desks spaced at least 3 feet apart and limits on kids packed into bus seats.
At Baxter Avenue movie theaters in Louisville, owner Les Aberson said a year of distanced seating, few theatergoers and delayed blockbuster movie releases has taken a toll. He hopes to get a Shuttered Venue Operators grant to stay afloat until movies and crowds return.
""Once people get vaccinated ... we'll be back at normal capacity,"" he said, adding that he thinks demand for new releases, as long as studios don't put them on streaming services at the same time, will bring back crowds. ""I think it's going to be through the roof.""
Sports too are starting to come back. The NCAA decided to have 25% capacity crowds at the 2021 Men's College Basketball tournament all held in Central Indiana.
In Louisville, Greg Galiette, the vice president of the minor league Louisville Bats, said fans are ready to come back when the season starts with 20% attendance that will include pod-seating in 2-, 4- and 6-person pods, as well as cashless concessions.
""Buying a printed program, those days are over,"" he said.
By the time it ends in September, he hopes that could be back to normal seating. If so, he thinks will fill up again.
""People are just itching to get back outside and come to a game, to get back to the way things used to be,"" he said.
'People are isolated from
one another'
Some churches are also expecting things to change in the coming months.
At Louisville's Highland Baptist Church, Rev. Mary Alice Birdwhistell took over the congregation in August but could only celebrate with a drive-through meet-and-greet with worshippers.
She hasn't once yet preached face to face. She expects masks and distancing rules will be used when they hold in-person services, but still isn't sure when.
""People are hungry to return. People are weary. People are lonely. People are so Zoom fatigued. People are isolated from one another,"" she said.
At the same time, ""some people have started to enjoy church from the couch, staying in their PJs and sipping their coffee, she said. ""I don't know that the old normal ever will return. I think we're looking at a new normal.""
Dr. Jon Klein, vice dean for research at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, expects people will face uncertainty in the spring as they begin making their own calculations about the safety of resuming old habits, based on whether they or their friends are vaccinated.
Even if the arrival of summer means rates that make people feel more comfortable, it will still take a shift in thinking after a year of barely thinking about socializing.
""My wife and I are talking about the same thing — when do we feel comfortable having some people over for dinner? Estimating risk is what most of us will be doing,"" he said, envisioning having vaccinated friends for dinner by mid-summer.
""There is a psychological hangover"" that may linger, Klein said.
If infection rates continue to go down and vaccination rates up until June, Klein said, ""then I think you'll begin to see increased occupancies permitted in indoor dining and movie theaters. And by Labor Day, if we keep driving things down, we may begin to see more things like indoor concerts and sporting events.""
Many still leery
about vaccinations
Much will depend on vaccination rates: A January survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found, 51% of people would not get it, would wait until they saw how it was working or would get it only if required.
But it also noted acceptance was rising.
Still, public health experts say rapid gains in vaccination numbers and continued distancing and mask-wearing will be critical over the next few months.
And some have warned that abandoning those measures too soon could lead hard-won gains to recede.
It's an open question whether, once the virus does finally abate and the restrictions fall away, some people maintain habits such as masking in certain circumstances developed during the pandemic.
""I'd love to see that continue. Do I think it'll happen? Probably not,"" Klein said, noting that historic pandemics have often been followed by creative and economic bursts and a bond-loosening ""profligate period.""
Think the roaring '20s after the 1918 Pandemic, he said.

958,"(TNSops) -- The Institute for Higher Education Policy issued the following news release:Data-informed decision-making has always been - and always will be - a smart approach to policy, including at institutions of higher education. Just over one year since the COVID-19 pandemic radically and abruptly shifted every aspect of higher education, states and institutions are tackling the same student success goals as before, but with smaller budgets, uncertainties around enrollment, and the potential for a prolonged recession. In the face of such challenges, the need to consult and apply data has never been greater. Students continue to face challenges of online or hybrid models while also navigating life in a pandemic that has disproportionately impacted Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and Asian American and Pacific Islander students and students from low-income backgrounds. To understand - and overcome - current obstacles in higher education, campuses across the country who have not yet cultivated a culture of data usage need to do so - stat.In a report released today, the Institute for Higher Education Policy (IHEP) outlines how to create and strengthen such a culture from top to bottom and across postsecondary institutions in order to support students most in need of the social mobility and economic security that higher education can provide. Developing a Data-Informed Campus Culture: Opportunities and Guidance for Institutional Data Use shares insights from a wide array of institutional experts on developing data-informed interventions that close gaps in access and completion. These approaches promote the collaborative use of data while also accounting for the capacity of an individual institution.""In the midst of the health and economic crises, the need to put data to work to support historically underserved students has never been more pressing,"" said Mamie Voight, IHEP's interim president. ""Research shows that Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and underrepresented AAPI students and students from low-income backgrounds have been most impacted by the pandemic. In other words, the students who stand to benefit the most from the mobility that a degree or credential can provide are the most at risk of having their education goals upended at this moment.""""States, colleges, and universities must harness the power of data to identify racial and socioeconomic inequities and drive institutional improvement,"" noted Konrad Mugglestone, IHEP's Assistant Director of Research and Policy. ""When used at its full potential, data informs effective solutions for better outcomes for students, families, communities, and our workforce.""Developing a Data-Informed Campus Culture: Opportunities and Guidance for Institutional Data Use identifies the building blocks for a data-informed campus and outlines five recommendations to, in the words of one interviewee, ""integrate across all [campus-wide] data silos and have a single 'truth' for the institution"": 1) identify data champions among leadership and across campus; 2) strengthen data literacy among all campus stakeholders; 3) establish unified metrics across offices and a data dictionary to standardize definitions and streamline analysis; 4) develop partnerships to streamline data processes, including synthesis and governance; and 5) invest time and resources in access to and use of high-quality data on campus.[Category: Education]null-7431749 T40-MgEditor",Institute for Higher Education Policy: Developing Data-Informed Campus Culture - Opportunities and Guidance for Institutional Data Use
961,"NEW YORK, Oct. 4, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- American Finance Trust, Inc. (Nasdaq: AFIN) (""AFIN"" or the ""Company"") announced today that the Company amended and restated its existing $540 million unsecured revolving credit facility and increased the size to $815 million (the ""Credit Facility"").  The Credit Facility matures in 4.5 years, has two 6-month extension options, and has a margin that is 15 basis points lower than the prior facility. The Credit Facility may be increased by $435 million pursuant to an ""accordion"" feature for a total of $1.25 billion, subject to obtaining additional lender commitments.
""Thanks to the high-quality underlying assets in AFIN's portfolio, we were able to expand our credit facility on what we believe to be very attractive terms,"" said Michael Weil, CEO of AFIN. ""We proactively replaced the prior facility early to take full advantage of an active corporate syndication market and provide increased benefits to AFIN with respect to terms and pricing. As a continuing part of our de-leveraging strategy, we believe this transaction further strengthens our balance sheet and provides additional flexibility for executing our acquisition and disposition strategies.""
The Credit Facility will be administered by BMO Harris Bank, N. A. and includes two six-month extension options. The interest rate on the Credit Facility adjusts based on the leverage ratio, with a minimum rate of 1.45% over LIBOR and a maximum of 2.05% over LIBOR. Upon AFIN or its operating partnership achieving an investment grade rating from any two of the three major rating agencies (Standard & Poor's, Moody's, and/or Fitch), AFIN may make a onetime irrevocable election to switch to credit rating based pricing, which decreases the applicable interest rate margins.

962,"Every few days, Bathsheba Collingwood sprays her furniture and walls with bleach to scrub away new traces of the persistent mold she suspects caused her 3-year-old sons asthma.
The bathroom pipes have been leaking into her closet for months, leaving puddles on the carpet when she takes long showers. The nails holding her living room floor in place sometimes poke up, stabbing at her feet. In the winter, her heating was unreliable. And as the weather warms, her air conditioning unit isnt working either.
Still, shes fighting to keep the two-bedroom apartment on Mercy Drive. If she is forced to leave, the 2007 Acura MDX she spent her stimulus check to purchase from a buy-here-pay-here lot in April will likely be her next home.
Now, Im extra afraid, said Collingwood, 38. Nobody else is going to take me. Nobody else is going to move me in with three evictions.
Tens of thousands of people in Florida lost their jobs during the coronavirus pandemic, leaving many at risk of eviction. But renters living in predominately Black neighborhoods were most vulnerable, new data compiled by the Shimberg Center for Housing Studies at University of Florida show. The data, which includes two years of eviction court filings for 61 of the states 67 counties, provides the most comprehensive look at eviction the Shimberg Center has ever produced.
An Orlando Sentinel analysis of the filings and U.S. Census Bureau demographic data in Orange, Osceola and Seminole counties in 2019 and 2020 shows that when Black residents are the largest racial group in a ZIP code, the eviction rate is likely to be significantly higher than in most predominately white ZIP codes nearby.
That was true before the pandemic and it persisted even as state and federal moratoriums and local rental assistance programs dramatically lowered eviction filings, which could ramp up again once those protections  -  which have failed many renters  -  are rescinded.
My district is like a tale of two cities, said City Commissioner Regina Hill, who represents an area stretching from the skyscrapers of downtown Orlando to the economically blighted neighborhoods on the citys west side. I have the economic machine downtown and I have those who make less than $8, $9, $10 an hour, and those who are homeless.
Hills constituents live in the ZIP codes with the largest Black populations in the region. Two ZIP codes in her district  -  32805 and 32808, which includes Parramore and West Orlando, where Collingwood lives  -  consistently saw eviction rates higher than the county average before and during the pandemic.
This is not the sign of a broken system, said Nikitra Bailey, an executive vice president at the Center for Responsible Lending. Unfortunately, its working exactly as its been designed.
She, along with other housing researchers, sociologists, lawyers and advocates, said the racial disparities in evictions are the result of decades of federal housing laws and government lending practices that have largely cut Black Americans out of homeownership  -  and the protections it comes with. While it can take months or years for a bank to foreclose on a homeowner, it often takes landlords just days to evict a renter.
Currently, about 70% of white Floridians own homes compared with only 47% of Black residents, according to Blaise Denton, research manager for the Florida Housing Coalition.
There is no income bracket where more white people rent than own, Denton said. And there is no income bracket where more white people rent than own free and clear.
Conversely, for Black Americans, homeownership does not surpass renting until the highest measured income level, Denton said. That also means those most insulated from housing instability are white.
And with real estate as the most valuable asset for most families, the homeownership gap has also contributed to a persistent wealth gap that makes it more difficult for Black families to keep up with rent, car notes, utility bills and other expenses when a financial emergency arises.
The wealth gap by race in the U.S. is just staggeringly large, said Alexandra Killewald, a sociology professor at Harvard University. Its not just that theres inequality. Its that its incredibly persistent, even at a time when, over that same period, some other disparities have gotten a little smaller.
Evictions higher in Black ZIPs
Osceola County has the smallest Black population in the region. Still, the ZIP code with the largest concentration of Black residents has the fifth-most evictions of the countys 17 ZIP codes, according to Shimberg Center data.
The eviction disparity is far more apparent in Orange and Seminole counties, where the Black population is larger, the data show.
Seminoles 32771 ZIP code in Sanford is nearly 27% Black, the countys largest concentration of Black residents. It is home to historic Goldsboro, which was one of the first Black-incorporated towns in the state. It also saw 806 eviction filings between 2019 and 2020, the most of any ZIP code in the county, and had the second-highest eviction rate when adjusted for population. Thats despite a median household income of nearly $62,000.
In Orange County, the five ZIP codes with the largest Black populations all appear in the top 10 ZIP codes for eviction, both by raw numbers and by eviction rate.
On one side of downtown is ZIP code 32803. It is 73% white and includes Lake Eola Heights, Colonialtown and Lake Underhill. There, less than 2% of renter households faced eviction.
About four miles away is ZIP code 32805 in Hills district. Its home to the historically Black Parramore neighborhood and stretches into West Orlando. About 75% of the residents there are Black, the highest concentration of Black residents in the county by ZIP. Its renters are more likely to face eviction than those anywhere else in the region. Between 2019 and 2020, renters in nearly 1 in 10 units were sued for eviction.
That is representative of the national crisis, said Emily Benfer, a visiting law professor at Wake Forest University and one of the nations foremost experts on eviction. The threat of eviction during the pandemic is concentrated in communities of color overwhelmingly. And that was also the case and the highest risk factor before the pandemic began.
We could have caught up
Until January, Donald Harper lived in a five-bedroom home off Old Winter Garden Road in ZIP code 32805 with his wife and five of their nine children.
Before the pandemic, the family was living within their means. Both Harper and his wife worked and Harper, who was a chef for a Loews Hotels restaurant, could cover the $1,995 a month they paid in rent with a single paycheck. They had struck a rent-to-own deal with their landlord and, after three years of renting, had plans to buy the house this year.
But on March 21, 2020, just 10 days after the World Health Organization declared that COVID-19 had caused a global pandemic, Harper and his wife were both laid off. From March 2020 to February, layoffs disproportionately harmed Black Floridians. According to the state Department of Economic Opportunity, the unemployment rate for Black workers was 11.2%. For white workers, it was 7.8%.
In the beginning, they thought they would be back at work by June and would be able to ride things out. They homeschooled the children and tried to keep making rent payments with a combination of their savings, their last paychecks from work and, eventually, their unemployment checks.
But then the extra federal unemployment benefits ended, Loews stopped covering Harpers medical insurance and his return date for work was pushed back again. Harper filled out countless job applications but more than 30 employers told him he was overqualified for the positions they had open.
Harper kept making payments toward rent until July. In August, they started to fall behind. His landlord, a longtime family friend, filed to evict the family on Dec. 17. Days later, Loews called him back to work security for $15 less per hour than his last position and he got a second job as a delivery driver for a local bakery.
He promised his landlord they would catch up.
Harper offered to pay at least half the rent each month until he was back on his feet. He tried to get help through a county-run rental assistance program but the money was capped at $4,000 per family and landlords had to agree to forgive the rest of the back rent.
County officials said they emailed Harpers landlord to see if she would agree to the terms of the program but she never responded. Reached by the Orlando Sentinel, Harpers landlord refused to be interviewed on the record.
It took just five weeks from the initial eviction filing to the day an Orange County deputy sheriff showed up at the Harpers door with his landlord and a locksmith to force the family out.
In one day, they packed up the five-bedroom house and moved their belongings into three storage units. Harper and his three boys went to a homeless shelter in Clermont. His wife and their two girls went to another one an hour away in Melbourne.
They lived separately in shelters for nearly three weeks before moving in with family in Winter Haven.
To go through such an ordeal like that when youve never experienced anything like this before was shell shocking, Harper said. If she would have just left us in the house, we could have caught up by now on all of the back rent. ... I expected my landlord to have more common sense and more common courtesy.
I dont even call it a moratorium
The moratorium on evictions issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should have protected Harpers family. They fit all the criteria: They suffered a major financial loss because of the pandemic. They attempted to make payments. They sought government assistance. They were at risk of homelessness if they were evicted.
They were also one of the many families forced out anyway.
I dont even call it a moratorium because it doesnt blanket stop everything like you would think, said Jamos Jay Mobley, senior housing attorney at The Legal Aid Society in Orange County.
All the CDC moratorium did was give them more time. Before the pandemic, when a landlord filed for eviction, a tenant could only present a defense if they were able to pay the rent their landlord said they owed into a court registry within five days. If they didnt, the landlord automatically won on Day 6.
For now, automatic defaults have been paused.
But landlords are more powerful in Florida than most other states. If they push back at all, even with the moratorium in place, they are likely to win, Mobley said.
All the landlord has got to do is file a piece of paper that says they want a default and they will get it, Mobley said.
Even when that happens, the CDC moratorium should stop the final stage of the eviction. But many are still getting pushed out.
I think the most important thing that we can do as a community is ensure that people stay housed, said Allison Krall, president of the Coalition for the Homeless of Central Florida. Homelessness is a trauma for anybody who finds themselves in that very unfortunate situation. ... I dont think that, unless you have found yourself on the brink of homelessness, that you can understand how terrifying that can be.
And its not just an emotional trauma.
Researchers have found that more evictions meant more deaths during the pandemic, as people were forced to share space with family members and friends or move into shelters full of strangers.
Even in normal times, just getting an eviction notice leads to declines in mental and physical health. It increases the likelihood of sexual assault for women and the risk of lead poisoning and food insecurity for children, while shortening life spans overall, Benfer said.
Eviction is this perfect storm that leaves particularly Black households extremely vulnerable when crisis strikes, Benfer said. And when an unexpected emergency arises, let alone a pandemic, that takes away all your pillars of resiliency and stability, like housing, your childrens education, your employment, and just sets you up for this downward slide thats jagged and dangerous and harmful, and theres no ladder back up.
Eviction shaping the lives of women
Across the country, eviction paperwork is usually kept by county clerks, not state agencies. That means tracking every eviction filed even in a single state can require communicating with dozens of local administrators. Nationally, its thousands  -  subject to different records laws and using varied data storage systems.
Records often go missing and, even when they can be accessed, there is typically no indication of the tenants race, ethnicity or gender, making it difficult to assess which groups are suffering the most from evictions.
And those filings are still just a fraction of the number of people forced out of their rental homes each year. Missing from the courts count are all the people who face informal evictions.
That can look like a landlord posting a notice on a tenants door without ever filing a lawsuit  -  knowing that many tenants will leave quietly, rather than fight. Thats the nice version of informal eviction, said Alana Greer, director of the Community Justice Project, which provides legal services to people of color in low-income neighborhoods.
Its often, Im going to turn off the electricity or Im going to tow your car or Im going to come to your apartment with a baseball bat, she said. There is intense intimidation that can happen.
But despite the limitations of the data, researchers have repeatedly come to the same conclusion: Black renters are far more likely to be victims of eviction than any other racial or ethnic group.
Washington, D.C.-based think tank New America studied eviction data in Orange County from 2017 to 2019 and found that every single neighborhood that was more than 50% Black had an eviction rate that was higher than the county average, according to Sabiha Zainulbhai, a senior analyst for the organization.
In his 2016 book Evicted: Poverty and Profit in the American City, Princeton University sociology professor Matthew Desmond said it is Black women in particular who are most harmed, comparing the eviction crisis for Black women to the crisis of mass incarceration for Black men.
If incarceration had come to define the lives of men from impoverished Black neighborhoods, eviction was shaping the lives of women, wrote Desmond, who also founded Eviction Lab, which tracks evictions nationwide. Poor Black men were locked up. Poor Black women were locked out.
Collingwood lives off Mercy Drive in ZIP code 32808, which is about 69% Black. It is home to the second-highest concentration of Black residents and has the second-highest eviction rate in the region. Between 2019 and 2020, 1,815 people faced eviction in her ZIP code.
She was evicted the first time in 2019 shortly after she gave birth to her son. She couldnt work and quickly fell behind on rent. After the eviction, most landlords would not even consider her as a tenant, so she lived with her mother for a time, before they had a falling out and she became homeless.
First she lived in her car, sleeping in hospital parking lots. Later, with the help of her sons father and cash from her tax return, she lived in an extended stay motel. Then, a former neighbor who had been evicted around the same time as her told Collingwood about 7M Real Estate.
They would take tenants with past evictions.
She moved into the apartment last May. The 40-unit complex wasnt her first choice. It wasnt as quiet or as clean as she wanted it to be, but she moved in anyway.
Its not where you live, she told herself. Its how you live.
Scared to move
The plan was to stay for a few years. She would ride out the pandemic, work and save. Hopefully, by the time she was ready to move again, her eviction would be so old that other landlords with cleaner, safer properties would give her a chance. But after repeatedly getting her hours slashed at the local Chinese restaurant where she was a delivery driver, she fell behind on rent.
Most of her neighbors were in similar situations. Since last summer, Collingwood has watched almost all of them disappear  -  by April, all but about seven of the 39 families who lived there when she moved in were gone, by her count.
The lucky ones had time to pack their things and move out, sometimes as armed Orange County Sheriffs Office deputies watched. The unlucky came home to find their belongings on the lawn in front of their units and their locks changed.
In August, 7M Real Estate filed an eviction suit against Collingwood and about 40 other tenants across two properties. Hill, the city commissioner, said she thinks the evictions were retaliation after the residents banded together and reported the leaks, mold, roaches and other issues to the citys Code Enforcement Division.
A judge ruled that Collingwood could stay in her apartment and, on Dec. 22, the federally funded Orange County Eviction Diversion Program paid $4,000 in back rent on her behalf to property management company Midtown Realty.
That should have protected her from eviction for at least 60 days, but Urban Square  -  a company that recently bought the complex Collingwood lived in from 7M for $1.5 million  -  filed suit against her again in January, after she had again fallen behind.
Representatives for 7M Real Estate and Midtown Realty did not respond to request for comment. Urban Square declined to be interviewed through its attorney.
Collingwood is worried that any future landlord wouldnt take the time to dig into her evictions and learn that her latest two were for the same apartment and should never have been filed.
All theyre going to see is three evictions, she said.
Suspecting that the end of the CDC order is looming and expecting that she will soon be forced to leave, Collingwood started a GoFundMe fundraiser in hopes that people would help her raise money to move. In just over one month, she was only able to bring in $120. After fees, $115 was deposited onto her Chime bank card.
Collingwood is discouraged.
With these evictions on my record, Im afraid to even go to more apartments and ask them to consider me, she said. ... Im scared to even try to move anywhere.

968," Ms. Esther Feng  Tel: +886-2-8978-6488 ext. 667  estherfeng@trendforce.com  Ms. Pinchun Chou  Tel: +886-2-8978-6488 ext.669  pinchunchou@trendforce.com  Owing to the stay-at-home economy brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, not only did yearly notebook computer shipment surpass 200 million units for the first time ever, but the 22.5% YoY growth was also the highest on record, according to TrendForce’s latest investigations. However, in comparison with 2Q20, during which production lines resumed operations, and notebook demand saw an uptick, the current global market is plagued by the ever-intensifying pandemic, with various countries instating border control and lockdown measures, making it impossible at the moment to accurately forecast the state of the notebook market in 2H21. Nevertheless, TrendForce currently expects global notebook shipment for 2021 to reach 217 million units, an 8.6% increase YoY. Incidentally, it should be noted that the increasing popularity of distance education has also galvanized a rising demand for Chromebooks, which have contributed substantially to the growth of the overall market. Chromebooks accounted for 14.8% of the global notebook shipment in 2020, while this rate is expected to rise to 18.5% in 2021.  As WFH becomes the new normal for office work, online meeting functionalities will be a major focus of business notebook designs  Since 2020, various companies worldwide have announced the implementation of WFH measures, with certain companies adopting WFH until September this year. In order to meet the audiovisual demands of online meetings, as well as the personal and entertainment needs of end users, notebook brands have been making improvements to their business notebooks’ functionalities, including AI, camera modules, sound quality, background noise removal, and image qualities. In particular, HP, Dell, and Lenovo are each releasing new mid-range and high-end mixed-use business notebooks in response to the commercial opportunities generated by the aforementioned user demands. Demand for this product category is expected to peak in 1H21 and in turn massively raise overall notebook shipment for the period as well.  In addition to mixed-use business notebooks, the new normal in the post-pandemic era has compelled brands to quickly establish dominance in the Chromebook market as well. Although Chromebook shipment reached 29.6 million units in 2020, an impressive 74% YoY growth for year, current demand from most educational markets has yet to be met. This, along with continued Chromebook adoption in Central America, South America, and the Asia-Pacific regions, resulted in peak Chromebook demand. At the moment, TrendForce projects yearly Chromebook shipment to exceed 40 million units in 2021, a 37% YoY growth. Moreover, given Google’s aggressive product strategies, this projection may have even further room for growth.  Continued high demand for Chromebooks has resulted in shifts in the OS and CPU markets  With regards to operating systems, Windows remains the dominant choice in the notebook market. However, due to the rapid growth of Chromebooks in 2020, Windows’ market share dropped below 80% for the first time ever. Windows is unlikely to recover its lost market shares in the short run, since its decline is expected to persist going forward. TrendForce expects the market shares of Windows, Chrome OS, and MacOS to each stabilize at about 70-75%, 15-20%, and below 10%, respectively.  With regards to notebook CPUs, AMD’s Zen+ microarchitecture-based CPUs saw a major uptick in notebook adoption in 2019, with about an 11.4% market share. This figure rose to 20.1% in 2020 after a period of product ramp-up. In particular, the Ryzen 3000 series CPUs have been receiving excellent market feedback in the entry-level and mid-range notebook segments, thereby convincing notebook brands to start equipping their Chromebooks with AMD CPUs, bringing about a further and considerable growth in AMD’s market share.  The Apple Silicon M1 processors, based on the ARM architecture and officially released in November 2020, reached a mere 0.8% market share for the year. Apple adopted the ARM architecture primarily to optimize MacBook performances. Along with the release of Apple Silicon M1, Apple has also completed the integration between its hardware, software, and SaaS platforms. The company is expected to release 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros, both of which will be equipped with Apple’s in-house CPUs, after 2Q21, raising Apple’s notebook market share to about 7%. The 7% and 20% market shares from Apple and AMD, respectively, mean that Intel will be faced with increasing competitive pressure in the market and need to deliver an appropriate product strategy in response.

969,"NEW YORK – Andreas Koutsoudakis Sr.'s restaurants have been reborn a couple of times after crises.
The fire department relied on his lower Manhattan diner as a rescue site in the days after the Sept. 11 attacks. When he and his partner returned, they renovated and took over the spaces next door that other businesses left when they closed up shop.
In 2014, Koutsoudakis opened Tribeca's Kitchen, a few blocks over. When crisis hit again – in the form of the COVID-19 pandemic – the task of steering the restaurant through recovery fell to his son, Andreas.
The elder Koutsoudakis contracted COVID-19 and died in the early days of the pandemic. The loss stunned Koutsoudakis Jr., a lawyer with his own firm.
""I actually destroyed the store, demolition wise, before I even knew what I was going to do with it,"" he said.
Koutsoudakis' life, like many New Yorkers', changed 20 years ago after the Sept. 11 attacks. Once again, New York City has found itself at the center of tragedy and death, leaving many to wonder: How will it recover?
""New Yorkers are again mourning the loss of loved ones. Businesses have closed. Some people have moved. A lot have questioned the future of the city,"" former Mayor Michael Bloomberg told USA TODAY. ""But people have short memories. The comeback that New Yorkers led 20 years ago should fill us with optimism, because there's no reason we can't do it again.""
On the morning of Sept. 11, 2001, Dee C. Marshall was chatting with a co-worker about their grandmothers when someone told them about a fire at the World Trade Center.
Marshall went to the window of her building at One New York Plaza, several blocks south of the World Trade Center, and saw a low-flying airplane hit the south tower.
Marshall ran to the elevator, but when the doors closed and didn't reopen, she climbed down 33 flights of stairs and fled the area with her colleagues.
""I remember feeling like a character in a video game,"" she said.
In New York City, 2,753 people were killed as al-Qaida hijackers flew two airplanes into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, according to the 9/11 Memorial & Museum. A hijacked plane flew into the Pentagon outside Washington, and another crashed into a field in Pennsylvania, bringing the death toll from the attacks to 2,977.
New York City's first COVID-19 death occurred March 11, and less than a month later, the city surpassed its 9/11 death toll. It reached the national death toll from the attacks April 2.
More than 33,800 people have died in New York City from the coronavirus.
Both events caused scores of deaths, but the notion that either should have taken leaders by surprise is untrue, said Angus Gillespie, an American studies professor at Rutgers University.
The federal government-backed 9/11 Commission report details attacks leading up to Sept. 11, including the World Trade Center bombing in 1993 that killed six people and injured 1,000. U.S. intelligence briefings suggested a public health crisis in China was occurring in November 2019, months before the virus took hold in the USA.
""In both cases, the U.S. government was too slow to respond,"" Gillespie said.
'Every day ... a war zone'
As she returned to commuting into the city from New Jersey within a few weeks of the attacks, Marshall, who was working at One New York Plaza, noticed hundreds of police officers.
""Every day going to work, it felt like I was going through a war zone,"" Marshall said.
The daily reminders of the attacks continued for weeks: The rancid smell from ground zero persisted. She called her mother every day to let her know she made it into the office safely. She wrote her next of kin information on the back of a business card she kept with her ID badge.
""For people like me, people who continued to work downtown, they would say, 'No, (Sept. 11) wasn't a single day.' It did have some lasting effect, particularly if you had to see it every single day,"" Marshall said.
About a month after she returned, her company downsized, and Marshall's job was cut – which she said was a ""blessing"" as it led to a new job away from the area.
There was great concern after Sept. 11 that companies would leave and people would not want to live and work in lower Manhattan, said Lynne Sagalyn, Columbia Business School professor emerita of real estate.
""There were lots of moving vans,"" said Sagalyn, who wrote the book ""Power at Ground Zero: Politics, Money, and the Remaking of Lower Manhattan.""
""It was really, really difficult to live downtown,"" she said. ""Areas were cordoned off for long periods of time, in the beginning, the utilities were destroyed ... restaurants closed, there was nothing there. It was a bomb site.""
As many as 4,500 residents of lower Manhattan left , according to a city report. The number of tourists dropped for two years before recovering by 2003, according to the city's tourism corporation.
To draw people back, Bloomberg said, the focus had to include quality-of-life issues: safety, cleanliness, good schools and public transit.
""If you can deliver results in all of those areas, people will come in droves. And that's what happened post-9/11. Our objective wasn't just to bring the city back. It was to propel it forward,"" said Bloomberg, who took office less than four months after the attacks.
Sagalyn said the Lower Manhattan Development Corp., a city and state enterprise, had a large pool of funds that helped support the entire area, not only the rebuilding of the World Trade Center. The organization provided subsidies to retain tenants and residents of office buildings and apartments, which she called ""critically important"" for driving redevelopment.
Amid the pandemic, New York City saw a dip in its population. Times Square was nearly deserted, and the typically packed subways were sparsely filled. Tourists visiting in 2020 dropped by 67%, and the economic impact of the industry fell by 75%, according to the state comptroller.
In turn, the same questions have been asked: Will people want to live and work in the cramped spaces of Manhattan?
""The city can't mandate that people go back and work in office buildings. They have to provide the ingredients – safe sanitation, in some cases maybe incentives – to restart the economy or make sure that the private sector can restart the economy,"" Sagalyn said.
That's a different challenge than physically rebuilding lower Manhattan – which was ""terribly fraught,"" Sagalyn said.
The city lacked control over the World Trade Center site, and disagreements between city, state and private developers delayed rebuilding, other than cleanup, for at least five years, Sagalyn said.
Still, for a project of its size, One World Trade Center was built relatively fast, Sagalyn noted, opening in October 2014, and the rest of the area was completed not long after.
Public health crises
Decisions made around reopening amid COVID-19 also caused tensions between the city and state, Sagalyn said.
Throughout the pandemic, public disagreements between Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo defined how some city COVID-19 policies were developed. The pair often held competing news conferences delineating different approaches to the same issue or took not-so subtle jabs at each other in the news media.
The two debated publicly over whether there should be a ""shelter-in-place"" order, and disagreements over school closures left parents and teachers wondering whether classes would be held in person.
""There were all these squabbles between Bill de Blasio and Andrew Cuomo,"" said Gillespie, the Rutgers professor. ""So my conclusion about lessons learned from COVID in New York City is the consequences of inaction probably led to more death.""
Attorney Michael Barasch, who represents first responders and survivors who said they developed illnesses caused by the air in Manhattan after the Sept. 11 attacks, said both 9/11 and the pandemic should be treated as public health crises.
In both cases, he said, the federal government lied in a way that hurt New Yorkers. Much like President Donald Trump downplayed risks in the early days of the pandemic, Barasch said, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency told New Yorkers their air was safe after the attacks. The EPA later admitted it didn't have enough data to make such a claim.
""There was a blind trust that the EPA said it was safe. So why should I be afraid of getting out of the subway and walking into my office? Or going back to school or going back to my my downtown apartment?"" Barasch said.
More than 112,000 people have enrolled in the federal World Trade Center Health Program, including first responders and the thousands of survivors who worked, lived or went to school in the area. The program has tracked tens of thousands of cases of respiratory illnesses and rare cancers tied to toxins released in the air after the attacks, and more people have died from 9/11-related illnesses than on the day of the attacks.
""It's striking how many people will come in and say, 'I have 9/11 syndrome. These are my health issues after 9/11,' because they were in the area,"" Dr. Antonio Dajer said.
On Sept. 11, Dajer was the attending physician in the emergency room of the hospital now called NewYork-Presbyterian Lower Manhattan Hospital, blocks from the World Trade Center.
The ER worked efficiently and decisively on the day of the attacks, he said. Health workers were prepared for a major disaster, having run drills and having experienced the World Trade Center bombing in 1993.
""I'm actually still pretty proud of how we responded,"" Dajer said.
But there was a lack of coordination from political leaders in the days and weeks after the attacks, Dajer said.
For example, first responders were exposed to the toxins for extended periods  as the search-and-rescue efforts continued, despite no one being pulled from the rubble alive after Sept. 12. Dajer pointed to the collapse of a building housing the city's emergency command center, which damaged communication downtown on Sept. 11. Mayor Rudy Giuliani administration's had faced criticism over the decision to place the center so close to the World Trade Center after the bombing in 1993.
Having treated COVID-19 patients in the Manhattan ER throughout the pandemic, Dajer said there's been a similar shortsightedness in planning, from the lack of a comprehensive testing infrastructure in the USA to the unscientific promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment.
""What strikes me about the two crises is that you would imagine a coordinated, high level, rational approach to both of them. And there was not one,"" he said.
'People are drawn to New York'
Despite the worries after Sept. 11, businesses and residents returned to lower Manhattan. According to the city's figures, the population grew by 25% from 2000 to 2005.
Public transportation and green space has improved, and the 9/11 Memorial opened 10 years after the attacks, followed by the museum opening to the public in 2014.
Even as the delta variant drives a new surge in COVID-19 cases in New York, there are positive signs for the city's economic growth. Census data shows its population has grown since 2010. Its vaccination rates outpace national averages. Ridership on public transport and foot traffic in Times Square have risen since the pandemic's lows. Though the availability of office spaces in Manhattan remains high, occupancy and leasing has increased amid limited reopening, according to real estate services provider Savills.
Koutsoudakis, who took over his father's restaurant, said he hopes the fears around COVID-19 will be alleviated in the way tension eventually eased after Sept. 11.
""When 9/11 happened, I remember talking about how forever we're going to live in this 'fear of terrorism' state,"" he said. ""And slowly but surely, it just became something that's in the background.""
In the years after the attacks, Koutsoudakis said his father thought about what would be next for Tribeca. Part of the decision to open his own place was driven by the foresight that rents would keep increasing and new residents would want different restaurants with updated menus.
Koutsoudakis redesigned the restaurant to honor his father's legacy as a man dedicated to family and his neighborhood, modeling different parts of the restaurant after his family's home.
Outdoor dining opened in July, and state restrictions eased in February, allowing a full return indoors.
""People are drawn to New York. ... (It) doesn't matter what you throw at us, we're always going to try to find a way to make it work,"" Koutsoudakis said. ""I haven't seen anything strong enough to indicate that that's not here anymore.""

973,"HAMILTON -- As if COVID-19 wasn’t wreaking enough havoc on sports seasons, the Hamilton Big Blue boys’ basketball team walked on to its home court Friday night for a Greater Miami Conference game against Lakota West under yet another cloud.
The team and community learned earlier in the day that athletic director Bill Stewart, on the job less than a year after being hired in April, had resigned after the Ohio High School Athletic Association discovered a violation of transfer rules. The discovery and subsequent school district investigation prompted the OHSAA to order the Big Blue to forfeit all of its wins this season, dropping its overall record to 0-12 and GMC log to 0-8 going into the game against the Firebirds.
The usual virus-mandated sparse, masked crowd, along with socially distanced cheerleaders and a pep band, watched as Lakota West (8-4, 6-2) took an early lead and never lost it in a 76-63 win over the suddenly undermanned Big Blue.
Four players listed on the Hamilton’s roster found on the GMC website were missing from the roster provided by the Big Blue stat crew for the game—juniors Andrew Huff, E.J, Kapihe and Sage Tolentino and sophomore Davis Avery. Kapihe and Tolentino are transfers from Hawaii. The 7-foot Tolentino, an Auburn commit, was on hand, but not in uniform due to an injury. Kapihe also did not dress. Big Blue sophomore forward Breeon Ishmail confirmed earlier reports that Kapihe’s transfer was the issue.
“Sage will be back,” said Ishmail, who scored a career-high 25 points and pulled in 11 rebounds. “E.J. won’t. It’s transfer stuff. We’re 0-13. That’s a lot. We’re going to do good for the rest of the season.”

Hamilton may continue to play its scheduled games and is eligible to participate in the Division I postseason tournament, according to an OHSAA statement.
“In cooperation with Hamilton High School administrators, it was discovered that a member of the school’s varsity boys basketball team should not have been permitted to participate due to not having a parent living in Ohio, according to OHSAA Bylaw 4-6-2,” the OHSAA said in a statement. “As a result, the school must forfeit any victorious contests in which the ineligible student participated and the student may not resume participation until he has a parent who is a resident of Ohio. At this time, there are no other penalties assessed to the school. The team may continue playing its scheduled contests and enter the OHSAA tournament.”
Hamilton coach Kevin Higgins would talk after the game only about the game.
“I’m not talking about it,” he said when asked about anything related to the Stewart’s resignation and the transfer controversy. “I’m not saying anything about it. I cannot talk about it. Don’t ask.”

Sophomore forward Nathan Dudukovich scored 28 points, senior guard Kelvin Turner added 20 and six assists and senior forward Brady Weber contributed a career-high 18 points while pulling in 13 rebounds for the Firebirds (8-4, 6-2), who went into the game third in the GMC behind first-place Fairfield and second-place Lakota East. Lakota West, which has won three straight games and four of its last five, is scheduled to play a non-league game against Springboro on Saturday before resuming it’s GMC schedule against Sycamore at Lakota West on Tuesday.
The Big Blue is scheduled to play at Fairfield on Tuesday.
Lakota West coach Jim Leon was asked how impressed he was with Hamilton’s resilience under the circumstances, The Big Blue cut a game-high 14-point, early second-quarter deficit to four by halftime.
“Really impressed,” Leon said. “I texted Kevin earlier in the day and said ‘Sorry about everything that’s going on.’ It’s got to be hard, It’s tough mentally. He said, ‘We’re starting a new season.’”","Long day of forfeits, resignation for Hamilton basketball ends with loss to Lakota West"
974,"Brunswick's Salvation Army thrift store will close for good after 18 years of operating, the organization announced last week.
In September, the international Christian organization said it expected the closure to be temporary, and the shutdown was attributed to a labor shortage that has affected businesses and organizations nationwide.
""The decision to close the store was not made lightly,"" Envoy Stephen Taylor, who oversees The Salvation Army thrift store in Brunswick, said in a news release. ""But after much review, it seems to be the most responsible choice, especially in light of the struggles we've had maintaining adequate staffing at this location.""
The Salvation Army, which operates retail stores selling donated goods, originally hoped to reopen the 127 Pleasant St. location on Sept. 21 after closing in late August.
The store was forced to reduce hours and close several times during the COVID-19 pandemic because of staffing issues, the release said, adding that The Salvation Army regularly reviews the financial performance of stores, services and programs, and ""offerings are discontinued only when absolutely necessary.""
The Brunswick location also worked with The Salvation Army's social services program to help families in need through a voucher system. The release stated that assistance for financial hardship and other issues will continue to be available through the service office located in Bath at 25 Congress Ave. as well as in other stores, such as the locations in Portland, Lewiston and Raymond.
""The Salvation Army would like to thank the people of Brunswick for their understanding during this time of transition and for all of their support over the last 18 years,"" the release stated.
Attempts to contact Taylor for further comment Wednesday were unsuccessful.
The Salvation Army, which was founded in 1865 and provides assistance to nearly 23 million Americans yearly, is not the only organization or business experiencing hardship during the current labor shortage.
The preliminary labor force participation rate in Maine for September 2021 was 60.4 percent, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That figure stood at 59.4 percent in September 2020, six months after the pandemic hit Maine, and at 62.7 percent in September 2019, six months before the COVID-19 pandemic.
The industries most impacted between September 2019 and September 2021 include accommodation, which saw a 33 percent decline in employees, food and services with a 14 percent decline, and arts and education, which also declined 14 percent.
The preliminary unemployment rate for September 2020 was 4.8 percent. For the same month in 2020 and 2019, it was 4.9 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively.
James Myall, a policy analyst for the Maine Center for Economic Policy, believes that a lack of available child care and an elevated risk from COVID-19 are two factors contributing to the shortage.
""That's especially true for low-wage industries like restaurants, hotels and care homes,"" Myall said. ""In addition to low wages, those businesses tend to have harder working conditions, including things like irregular schedules, which make it hard for people to take those jobs if they have competing needs like child care.""
Most businesses locally are suffering from a labor shortage, but restaurants and those in food service seem to be suffering the most, said Debora King, executive director of the Brunswick Downtown Association. She estimated 75 percent of dining businesses in Brunswick need more staff.
""I haven't talked to a single restaurant downtown that's fully staffed,"" King said. ""I think it's important to concentrate our efforts and dollars on supporting these local businesses because if you don't support them now, they're not going to be around to support later.""
Outside of Brunswick, eateries in Bath and Topsham also have experienced difficulties with staffing.
Cafe Creme in Bath announced new hours of operation this month after being forced to shorten them due to, in part, a labor shortage caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
The cafe announced in a Facebook post Oct. 16 that it will be closed on Tuesdays and Thursdays moving forward and will close at 1:30 p.m. on Sundays. The coffee shop was previously open seven days per week and has ""always been proud of our 'always open' mantra,"" the announcement reads, ""but as you know, 2020 and 2021 have not been business as usual.""
""The final straw is the labor shortage that has left us understaffed on top of distribution issues, price hikes and changing labor mandates,"" Cafe Creme Owner Tonnie Schultz wrote.
Schultz promised the cafe would return to its original operating hours as soon as additional staff can be hired and trained.
Drew Victory, the owner of the Topsham restaurant Blueberries, said he has about six employees, down from the 11 he had before the pandemic. During the pandemic, the restaurant moved to takeout service only without an in-person dining option. Victory said the restaurant's food offerings haven't changed, but some front-of-house offerings like smoothies aren't available due to staff shortages.
""I don't see us going back to table service ever,"" Victory said. ""If I could get more employees, we could expand our to-go format. We have good food and loyal customers, so we're getting by, but it's unfortunate that we can't thrive.""
Victory is concerned the struggling foodservice industry will eventually hurt the tourism industry Maine relies heavily on.

975,"It has a lane like a bowling alley or a bocce court, the strategy of chess and some of the grace of  ice skating. The sport of curling continually captivates viewers every four years when the winter Olympics come into season, culling attention from wrestler Mr. T, who became a fan of the sport at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics.
I am watching Women’s Curling as they take on ROC. Led by @TeamPetersonUSA ,All right Ladies you know what you have to do. Go USA Go! @usacurl @TeamUSA #USACurling #USA
— Mr. T (@MrT) February 10, 2022
Mr. T isn’t the only supporter of the sport. In Connecticut, curling is gaining momentum thanks in part to local curling clubs that offer leagues and learning events for those interested. Bridgeport’s Nutmeg Curling Club hosts general “Learn to Curl” events where individuals or groups can spend an hour learning the ins and outs of the game from one of the club’s instructors. There’s even a “Curling & Cocktails” version offered by the Glenwood Avenue club in which budding curlers earn a cocktail after spending an hour on the ice learning the game.
According to the club’s director of marketing Jennifer Cummings, interest in curling has been steadily increasing. In fact, Cummings got her start with the club after curling captured her attention in the 2018 Olympics.
“I joined with my husband when the men won the gold in the last winter Olympics,” she said. “Now I’m on the board and doing marketing for the club, and just since the Olympics have started, there are so many more calls. The ‘Learn to Curls’ are getting filled up, and people are interested. They see it on TV and they’re like, ‘I could try this.’”
The club’s events are being snapped up quickly, Cummings said, quickly enough that newly-added events are filled within days.
“We put up an event last Tuesday, and we had 30 spots for our traditional ‘Learn to Curl,’ and by that Saturday, it was completely full,” she said. “We have to rearrange some things on the calendar to accommodate for more ‘learn to curls’ because it’s such a busy time with the Olympics.”
The Bridgeport-based club isn’t the only curling spot in the state. Litchfield County has the Norfolk Curling Club, which has a five-week spring league for those with little to no curling experience. The club also offers “Learn to Curl” events, and on Feb. 12, it’s hosting an “Olympic Open House” for participants ages 12 and older to hit the ice and test out the sport. The open house offered 11 times slots for participants to preregister, and all 11 are filled.

Yale’s Chen wins Olympic gold medal in Men’s Figure Skating
While interest in the sport may be growing, curling itself has been around for centuries. Its origins date back to 16th century Scotland, according to TIME, and its first recorded match took place in 1541 between a Scottish notary and a monk. Nearly 300 years later in 1828, TIME notes that the first curling club in the U.S. was founded in Pontiac, Mich. Curling made its debut as a medal-earning Olympic sport in the 1924 games in Chamonix, France, according to TIME, and it was officially added to the Olympic program in 1998.

The U.S., however, earned its first gold medal in curling just four years ago when Minnesota native John Shuster led his four teammates through five consecutive victories to defeat the top-ranked Swedish team 10-7. Shuster is leading the team again this year, which currently has a 1-1 record after falling to Sweden in its most recent Olympic match. With Team USA's men’s team seeking to defend its gold-medal status in the 2022 Olympics and attention mounting toward the sport once again, Cummings said the pull to give curling a try comes from both its methodical nature and its approachability.
“It’s very accessible to any age, and if you’re in relatively good shape, you can get really good at the sport very quickly — and even if you aren’t, you can still do well because it’s basically like shuffleboard on ice,” she said. “It’s more of a thinker’s sport. There’s strategy involved in how you get those stones down into the house and what you should throw next. In that sense, it’s almost like chess, where you have to think ahead to what your opponent is going to do.”
And a strategic game it is. The main objective is to aim for the center of a bulls-eye known as the “house” with each push of a granite stone on the ice, according to NPR. Sweeping along can help the stone travel farther or straighten its path, NPR reports; each throw of a stone aims to knock the opposing team’s stones out of the house or block their path. After eight rounds of play (or 10 if it’s an Olympic match), Cummings said it’s tradition for both teams to partake of a tradition known as “broomstacking,” in which the winning team buys the losing team drinks.
“At the end of the game, you sit around a table, and you talk about the game. You cheers each other and it’s all part of the tradition” she said.
It’s also how their “Curling & Cocktails” event came to be, according to Cummings, which is already filled to capacity for its Feb. 24 date. While the Nutmeg Curling Club won’t be doing any more of the cocktail events, it did add six more “Learn to Curl” events to their calendar that are already filling up quickly. They also have an open house on Feb. 13 and again on March 5.
As more attention is drawn to the sport, Cummings said those who opt for curling over other winter sports will find that there’s more to the game than what meets the eye.
“It’s more than just that adrenaline rush that you’re getting from other winter sports that are popular,” she said. “You’re also getting a lot of strategy, and there’s a lot more to the game than just going down a ski slope.”",Enjoy Olympic curling? These CT curling clubs can teach you how to play.
976,"Lonzo Ball became the third Bulls player to enter the league's COVID-19 protocols Sunday. Ball joined teammates Tony Bradley and Alfonzo McKinnie after coach Billy Donovan entered the NBA protocols Thursday. Sunday marked the first day of increased testing throughout the league to prevent further outbreaks due to the Christmas holiday. Starting Sunday, all players and coaches will be tested on game days unless they are 14 days removed from their booster shot. Players and staff also will be required to increase mask wearing on the sidelines during games and during team activities such as bus rides and practices.The Bulls' positive tests came swiftly Sunday around a scheduled shootaround session. Bradley and McKinnie returned positive tests directly before the shootaround began. Ball was removed from the training facility immediately after the session.""It happened so fast. He was doing a little bit of post-practice shooting and I went into my office, and then he was out of the building,"" assistant coach Chris Fleming said before serving as interim coach against the Indiana Pacers on Sunday night at the United Center. ""If you know how competitive Zo is, you know it'll hurt. He loves to compete, loves to play. It's tough.""Fleming also is expected to fill in for Donovan against the Hawks on Monday in Atlanta. Donovan supplemented the coaching via Zoom throughout the weekend, helping Fleming to rework rotations after each set of positive tests Sunday.The Bulls were enjoying a wave of excitement after the final batch of players previously in the protocols were cleared last week, including star guard Zach LaVine. The Bulls placed 11 players in the protocols in that span, although Devon Dotson tested out within 48 hours.Donovan joked Wednesday that he suddenly had too many players to rotate, but that enthusiasm quickly changed. The Bulls now have placed 14 players and one coach in COVID-19 protocols in December. Center Nikola Vu?evi? previously spent 11 days in quarantine with the virus in November. The coaching staff had remained unscathed until Donovan entered the protocols.""Yeah, I don't want to touch that,"" Fleming joked before Sunday's game. ""(Athletic trainer) Todd Campbell sits to the right of me during the game and Coach (Donovan) sits to the left and they both had it. In Miami, (broadcaster) Chuck Swirsky and I and Bill Wennington went to breakfast and Bill popped that same day. So I don't know how ... I'm just blessed to still be standing.""Only three active players on the Bulls roster haven't entered the COVID-19 protocols this season -- Alex Caruso, Tyler Cook and Marko Simonovi?. None of the players who tested positive experienced serious symptoms, and Donovan said most of the Bulls were asymptomatic. LaVine expressed optimism about the outbreak's ability to fortify the team against the virus in the future.""Hopefully we have herd immunity coming back and we won't have any more guys go down in the later months,"" LaVine said after practice Wednesday. ""I'm just thankful everybody is OK and everybody's families are OK.

978,"MADISON – Alvis Whitted's second season at Wisconsin is on track to be much better than his rookie campaign.
Consider that barely more than a week after Whitted was hired to coach UW's wide receivers in March 2020, the NCAA shut down its winter and spring sports because of COVID-19.
That meant no spring practice for UW and no in-person coaching for Whitted until preseason camp.
Then, after Big Ten teams finally got up and running in October, concussions limited UW's Kendric Pryor and Danny Davis to a combined five games and 11 receptions.
""We missed the experience of guys that know game situations, that know how to make plays in those tough situations,"" Whitted explained. ""We missed those down-the-field throws because they can take the top off of the coverage.
""When those guys are out there, they're different and they add a different dimension to our passing game.""
Whitted should have a deeper and more experienced unit when UW opens camp Aug. 6.
Davis and Pryor both opted to return for their final seasons.
Davis has 15 starts and 39 games played at UW. He has 99 catches for 1,164 yards and 12 touchdowns. Pryor has 24 starts and 40 games played at UW. He has 67 catches for 849 yards and four touchdowns.
Although being without Davis and Pryor for most of last season hurt the offense in the short term, players such as Jack Dunn and Chimere Dike got heavier workloads.
Dunn led the team's wide receivers in catches (28) and receiving yards (255). He was at his best in the final three games as he recorded 18 catches for 191 yards and a touchdown.
Not bad for a former walk-on who entered last season with a combined six catches for 61 yards and a touchdown.
Dike showed promise in his first college season and finished with 12 catches for 189 yards, an average of 15.8 yards per catch, and a touchdown.
""He can be trusted,"" Whitted said of Dike. ""He is dependable. His toughness. I love everything about that kid and what he's done.""
Davis, Pryor, Dunn and Dike were the top four receivers during spring ball, but the improved play of A.J. Abbott and Devin Chandler means Whitted could have six legitimate threats to use each week depending on the opponent and the game plan.
Chandler last season had two catches for 28 yards; Abbott had two catches for 12 yards. Both played in four games.
Both looked more confident running routes and catching the ball in the spring.
""This spring has been invaluable to our group,"" Whitted said. ""With repetition comes confidence.
""You could see the confidence in a lot of guys in their play.""
Dike, from Waukesha North High School, caught at least one pass in every game but the opener. He showed the ability to get deep, with a 49-yard touchdown at Northwestern, and catch the ball over the middle.
Nevertheless, he wasn't satisfied with his first season.
""It was sometimes difficult, especially when you're not having the results you want,"" he said. ""But I was just in there trying to execute my job. Obviously, things didn't always go as planned. I think I did some good things. Definitely had some things I can improve on.""
Whitted noted during the spring that Abbott, who will be a redshirt junior this season, focused on the details of playing the position and did more work off the field.
""He is physically gifted and he has taken a different approach to everything that the position requires,"" Whitted said. ""The study. The time after practice. And just coming up to see me.
""He is studying (more) and understanding the why. I think it is starting to resonate with him and you can see that in the plays that he makes.
""He adds an element of quickness and suddenness. He's just got to stay on course and not get satisfied with being where he is now.""
The loss of Davis and Pryor no doubt hurt UW's offense in 2020. Their return no doubt will help UW's offense in 2021.
But Davis stressed anyone who doesn't look beyond that duo when talking about UW's wide receivers is making a mistake.
""It's not just me and Kendric,"" he said. ""We've got Jack. We've got Chim. We've got A.J. Abbott, Devin Chandler. We've got a bunch of guys that it's all coming together. It has been fun for me. I know we all can make plays.""
Inside the huddle
It is no secret that having Danny Davis for only two games and Kendric Pryor for only three games affected UW's passing offense in 2020.
Their absence because of concussions also affected UW's ground game as both players are adept on the jet sweep.
After carrying once for 4 yards in the opener against Illinois, Davis rushed seven times for 65 yards and a touchdown at Michigan.
Pryor finished with 9 yards on two carries last season but both he and Davis were key components in UW's rushing game in previous seasons.
Davis enters the 2021 season with 244 yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries, an average of 10.2 yards per carry.
Pryor comes in with 368 yards and five touchdowns on 32 carries, an average of 11.5 yards per carry.
Their combined numbers: 56 carries for 612 yards, 10.9 yards per carry, and seven touchdowns.","Injuries to Davis, Pryor limited Badgers' pass game"
980,"In 2011, doctors told Carol and Chris Vanden Berg their oldest son was dying.
Their son, then-19-year-old Colin Vanden Berg, was in a coma after having a massive stroke following open heart surgery at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Some of the most experienced doctors in the country said the teenager may never wake up. If he did, they said, he'll likely be in a vegetative state for the rest of his life.
Three months later, he woke up.
And on Thursday, 10 years after his life almost ended from the stroke, Colin Vanden Berg walked at Millersville University's commencement ceremony.
The 29-year-old earned a bachelor's degree in English with a minor in print journalism in December 2020. Commencement was postponed until now due to COVID-19.
His achievement seemed to amaze everyone — except himself.
“This is just an accomplishment. It's hard for me, because I'm immediately thinking about trying to find a job and trying to find some ways I can volunteer,"" Colin Vanden Berg told LNP | LancasterOnline Wednesday inside his family’s Lancaster Township home. “I'm thinking about that. I'm not thinking about graduation. I'm thinking about what's next for me.""
 A long road 
Diagnosed with complex congenital heart disease after doctors discovered his heart wasn't pumping enough blood into his lungs, causing his skin to turn blue, Colin Vanden Berg underwent three heart surgeries before he was 2 years old.
After his third surgery, Colin Vanden Berg lived a relatively normal life until he began experiencing extreme fatigue in his senior year at Lancaster’s McCaskey Campus. Despite not feeling well, he managed to graduate with honors, receive the school's highest English award and go on to study on campus at Ursinus College in suburban Philadelphia for two years.
The fatigue, however, got worse. He could barely wake up in the morning. He struggled to focus in class. Then he failed one of his courses, which was uncharacteristic of an otherwise smart, hardworking student.
Alarmed, his parents brought him to Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. Doctors at CHOP determined he needed another surgery — this time to clear a blockage in his heart. On the afternoon of Jan. 20, 2011, he had open heart surgery.
The surgery itself was successful. But that evening, when the Vanden Bergs visited their son's hospital room, they noticed something was wrong. Colin Vanden Berg, his mother explained, would lunge forward in the bed, as if he was trying to sit up, but he couldn't stay upright, nor could he speak.
Because Colin Vanden Berg had metal coils in his heart from a previous surgery, getting an MRI wasn't an option, so they took a CT scan instead. The convulsions continued. Carol Vanden Berg finally asked, “Is he having seizures?"" The doctors said yes.
The doctors later determined he had a massive stroke in the middle-right portion of the brain. The exact cause remains unknown.
“I'm at a loss,"" Carol Vanden Berg remembers the surgeon telling them.
With their son in a coma, days turned into weeks, and weeks turned into months. Doctors told them to expect the worst, but they refused.
“I knew Colin,"" Carol Vanden Berg said. “And, you know, you could call it faith. You could call it whatever you want to call it, but I knew he was in there.""
Then there were signs of hope.
 Hope emerges 
Colin Vanden Berg started to turn his head toward music playing or one of his family members talking. Later, he'd start to motion as if he was responding to what was said to him, though he wouldn't speak. One day months into the coma, his mother noticed him pressing his index finger and his thumb together, then his middle finger and his thumb, and so on. Carol Vanden Berg grabbed a sock, put it in her son's hand, and he squeezed it. Then, she asked him to toss it to her. He did.
On April 6, 2011, just short of three months after his open heart surgery, Colin Vanden Berg awoke. The doctors immediately put a tube in his trachea so he could speak and started asking him basic questions. They offered to call his mother, who worked next door to the rehabilitation center in Lancaster where Colin Vanden Berg moved to several weeks after the surgery.
“I was working, and then all of a sudden I get this phone call on my direct line,"" Carol Vanden Berg said. “I pick it up, and (Colin Vanden Berg said), ‘Mom, they put this thing in my neck, and I can talk, and it's wonderful. And I want a slushy from Sonic.' ""
From then on, the victories kept coming. With the help of intensive therapies, Colin Vanden Berg learned to speak again, to read and write, to walk, to take showers, to type on the computer and tie his shoes, among other things.
Two years after he woke up, Colin Vanden Berg returned to college — this time at Millersville — starting with one class a semester, then two, then three. He joined the college newspaper, The Snapper, and became head copy editor. He even traveled to New York City with the staff.
“I really was kind of figuring this all out by myself,"" he said. “For the first time I had friends, actual college students that I could talk to. We could take the same classes. We would talk about the same professors. I felt it was the first time I felt not like an 8-year-old, I felt like a 28-year-old.""
It wasn't all smooth sailing. Working technology or taking notes and listening to a lecture simultaneously were near-impossible tasks. His short-term memory, imagination and math skills all seemed to disappear after his stroke. His vision and motor skills, particularly on his left side, are permanently impaired. He talks with a stutter and walks with a cane when outdoors and in crowds.
When the COVID-19 pandemic hit with mere months before completing his degree, Colin Vanden Berg turned into a “hermit,"" his mother said, because they didn't believe he would survive the virus with his heart and lung issues. He stayed in his room almost 24 hours a day doing schoolwork and watching YouTube videos.
 ‘The finish line’ 
Moving forward, he'll need assistance traveling, as he can't drive, as well as with common house chores like cooking and doing laundry. He'll also need approval from a doctor to return to work. His dream job is to be a newspaper film critic.
“When we were getting ready to leave CHOP, one of the doctors said, 'You know, this is not going to be a sprint. It's going to be a marathon,' "" Carol Vanden Berg said. “And I said, 'We've got track shoes on. We're ready to go.' ""
Graduating college, she said, is her son's greatest victory — and perhaps the marathon’s finish line.
Colin Vanden Berg interrupted her.
“The finish line is when I'm living by myself completely independently and going to work, or having work anyway, being financially stable,"" he said. “That's the finish line.""

983,"When teams play Temple, they know guard Mia Davis is scoring option No. 1.
Sporting an average of 21.5 points per game, she’s been one of the best players in the American Athletic Conference.
That emphasis on Davis means more Owls need to step up, and that’s what happened during the team’s current threegame winning streak. Guards Jasha Clinton and Asonah Alexander combined for 17 assists in Wednesday’s 66-57 win over East Carolina.
Guard Emani Mayo has made threes in five of six games, and she’s 5-for-12 in her last two games after starting the season 3-for-11. Alexa Williamson added 19 points in 19 minutes against ECU.
The Owls (3-3, 3-0 AAC) are to face Central Florida at home on Saturday.
Drexel’s stifling defense
One thing that didn’t change at Drexel during the coaching transition is the attention to detail on defense. Amy Mallon played a large role in the defensive performance as an assistant with Denise Dillon, and that’s even more evident now with Mallon as head coach.
The Dragons (4-1, 2-0 CAA) are ranked second in the nation in points allowed per game
(48.8). North Carolina Wilmington is the only opponent to score more than 50 points in a game, and Drexel followed that up by holding the Seahawks to a season-low 34 points the next day.
Welcome back, St. Joe’s
The last time St. Joseph’s played a basketball game, the Eagles won an NFL football game, and the Sixers were playing preseason NBA games.
St. Joe’s (2-0) returned to practice from its COVID pause on Monday. Head coach Cindy Griffin said that the team has done a lot of scrimmaging in practices to get as close to game speed as possible.
“We need to get them conditioning,” Griffin said.
La Salle defends its winning streak on Saturday
St. Joe’s opponent on Saturday will be LaSalle. The Explorers swept last season’s two meetings for the first time in school history.
Claire Jacobs earned Big Five player of the week honors last week, becoming the first Explorer to win it this season. She leads the Explorers (3-5, 0-2 A-10) with an average of 15.0 points per game.
Nova’s unlikely contribution
Villanova was back in the win column after losses to UConn and Depaul. The Wildcats (8-2, 3-2 Big East) defeated Seton Hall, 78-71, Wednesday.
Maddy Siegrist, Brianna Herlihy, and Sarah Mortensen combined for 57 of the 78 points. That’s hardly a surprise, but a bench contribution was. Freshman Taliyah Medina had a breakout performance with 11 points. She scored three points total in her previous five appearances. dcole@inquirer.com

986,"LOS ANGELES – As the clock ticked closer to zero, finally Phoenix Suns guard Chris Paul could exhale.
Normally, this marked the time that Paul experienced yet another playoff heartbreak. But shortly before the Suns officially eliminated the Los Angeles Clippers with a 130-103 win in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals on Wednesday at Staples Center, Paul was on the verge of advancing to the NBA Finals for the first time in his 16-year NBA career.
""That's the only thing I was thinking about – the process and getting us one step closer to where we need to be,"" Paul said.
So then Paul thanked those that witnessed his journey along the way. Paul waved to his hometown family and friends that attended Game 6 from Winston Salem, N.C. Paul hugged Suns coach Monty Williams, who had also coached him during his final season with the former New Orleans Hornets (2010-11).
Paul hugged his father and brother, both of whom have never missed any of his basketball games. And Paul waved to actor Billy Crystal and thousands of other Clippers fans, who both booed and cheered him after experiencing playoff heartbreak there for seven seasons (2011-2017) and asking for a trade to Houston that also followed with more injuries and playoff shortcomings.
During those moments, did Paul ever doubt he would experience the elation he felt after leading the Suns to the NBA Finals with 41 points and eight assists?
""Nope,"" Paul said. ""I ain't built like that. Just get to work.""
So in his third game since being sidelined for eight days after testing positive for COVID-19, Paul did just that. Paul led the Suns to their first Finals appearance since 1993 by tying his playoff career-high. He closed out the first half by scoring 10 unanswered points. He opened the third quarter by scoring eight unanswered points. During those times, Suns teammate Jae Crowder repeatedly asked Paul a pointed question.
""Can you taste it?"" Crowder asked. ""Can you feel it.""
Paul glared and sternly said ""no"" repeatedly for a simple reason. As Paul summed up, ""I've been on the end of so many losses. I know what it feels like.""
Yes, he does.
Paul committed two late turnovers that contributed to the Thunder overcoming a 15-point deficit in Game 5 of the 2014 conference semifinals, the same year the Clippers survived a seven-game first-round series over Golden State while handling the fallout over former owner Donald Sterling making racist statements on an audio tape. Though he played through an injured hamstring before making a game-winning shot in Game 7 of the Clippers' first-round series against San Antonio in 2015, Paul missed two games the following series before the Clippers squandered a 3-1 series lead to Houston.
In 2016, the Clippers lost in the first round to Portland in six games after Paul (fractured right hand) and Blake Griffin (left quad) suffered injuries in Game 4. Paul stayed healthy in 2017, but the Clippers lost to Utah in the first round amid Griffin suffering a right toe injury in Game 3. Shortly afterwards, Paul agreed for the Clippers to deal him to Houston in a sign-and-trade in hopes of winning an NBA title with James Harden. But Paul's health and the Warriors' dominance torpedoed those plans. Paul missed Games 6 and 7 of the 2018 Western Conference finals after straining his right hamstring in Game 5. The following season, Paul missed 17 games with a strained left hamstring and looked limited in the playoffs before the Warriors beat the Rockets in the second round. The Rockets then dealt him to Oklahoma City for Russell Westbrook.
""That burned him,"" Williams said of Paul's playoff shortcomings. ""If you can learn anything from Chris Paul, it's to keep going. Don't quit. Serve others.""
So, Paul remained intent on overcoming his own recent adversities.
Shortly after the Suns swept the Denver Nuggets in the second round, Paul learned that he tested positive for the coronavirus despite already having the COVID-19 vaccine. Though he became encouraged with the Suns winning the first two games against the Clippers without him, Paul then struggled in his return. In Games 3 through 5, he shot a combined 19-of-60 from the field and 2-of-16 from 3-point range. He then had an MRI on his right wrist that revealed torn ligaments.
Paul played in Game 6 anyway and then looked more like his normal self. He shot 12-of-18 from the field and 4-of-5 from deep. In the second half, Paul dropped 28 points.
During that time, Paul kept thinking about how the Rockets' equipment staff had kept a Western Conference championship t-Shirt and hat that he never could wear. The Suns' equipment staff received their gear earlier this week, reminding himself of how close he was toward finally wearing the gear.
""I was going to stay locked in,"" Paul said. ""If we do what we're supposed to do, I'll get the last laugh.""
Paul certainly did. He exacted revenge on his former team. He frustrated Clippers center DeMarcus Cousins so much on a foul that Cousins received a technical. He frustrated Clippers guard Patrick Beverley so much that Beverley wound up shoving him before getting ejected for it. And he added something to his eventual Hall of Fame resume that includes a high standing on the NBA's all-time assists list (currently fifth with 10,275).
""I learned a lot of stuff along the way,"" Paul said. ""This is a storybook for this part to get somewhere I never have been before against a team I've always been connected to.""",Paul finally makes NBA Finals
988,"Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer has pledged to take action, including possibly calling for outside investigations, after another death at Louisville's Metro Corrections was reported over the weekend – the fifth in six weeks.
""What we're going to do is follow the facts, and let's see what the facts show us,"" Fischer said Monday. ""Then we'll take the next step from there.""
The latest death involving the downtown Louisville jail was reported Sunday morning after a 66-year-old man was found unresponsive in the Metro Corrections medical housing unit about 10 a.m. He was unable to be revived following lifesaving efforts, according to a statement from Metro Corrections Assistant Director Steve Durham, and he was pronounced dead about 11 a.m. after being taken to University of Louisville Hospital.
The man was identified Monday afternoon by the Jefferson County Coroner's Office as Keith Smith, of Louisville. No cause of death was released pending autopsy results. He had been booked Wednesday on misdemeanor charges of criminal trespass and possession of drug paraphernalia.
""The Louisville Metro Police's Public Integrity Unit is investigating, a standard procedure, and Metro Corrections Director, Dwayne Clark, has directed Metro Corrections Professional Standards Unit to conduct a review of the case,"" Durham said Sunday.
Sgt. Daniel Johnson, who serves as president of FOP Lodge 77 (which represents jail employees), said the death is still under investigation but it ""currently has the appearance of a medical emergency.""
Sunday's news is not the first death at Louisville's jail in recent weeks. While Fischer noted that around three deaths are usually recorded at the jail in a typical year, five persons in jail custody have died over the past 41 days.
One man died while hospitalized after a reported suicide attempt at Louisville Metro Corrections on Jan. 2, jail personnel reported last weekend.
In late 2021, meanwhile, three people at the jail died within a five-day period in late November and early December. One of those deaths will be investigated by the FBI, Clark told Public Safety Committee members last month.
Staffing at Louisville's jail has emerged as a critical issue in recent months as well. Johnson said ""over 150 vacancies"" exist within the department, and with more employees, ""we could offer a far better service and closer observation of those in our care.""
""Since November we lost 17 sworn staff with 8 of those retirements,"" Johnson said Sunday in a statement. ""We continue to use well over 10,000 hours of overtime a month. Officers are not only working 16 hours a day but many are having to cover multiple positions making it nearly impossible to give job responsibilities the attention that it deserves.""
Fischer, speaking Monday morning, said the jail's medical housing unit was ""adequately staffed with corrections officers and medical professionals at the time of the inmates death"" but noted absences due to COVID-19 have been an issue at Metro Corrections, with ""about 50"" jail staffers currently out of work due to the coronavirus.
The number of people housed at the jail had dropped as of late last week from 1,665 to 1,412, Fischer said, in an attempt to take some weight off the shoulders of the staff.
The deaths, though, he said, are concerning, and require further review. Fischer said he's asked LMPD leaders to ""accelerate their investigations, and if we determine there's any type of pattern to these recent deaths, we'll certainly open further investigations."" The FBI is already involved with one investigation into a reported suicide last month at the jail, he said, and further involvement from federal officials is likely ""if there's any type of pattern to these recent deaths.""
Metro Corrections staffers recently voted to reject a proposed contract that would've boosted pay by 8% as well as increase starting salaries for new employees. Johnson said at the time jail workers did not believe the deal would ""solve the current staffing crisis"" at the facility.
Fischer said discussions about a new contract with Metro Corrections continued last week and over the weekend and that the union could vote ""later this week"" on a new deal. He said COVID-19 vaccine distribution has been prioritized in the jail and that conversations have also taken place recently with Wellpath, which provides medical and mental assistance at Metro Corrections, on a new contract that would ""devote additional resources to health and wellness services at the jail.""

989,"The Browns head into Pittsburgh for their first playoff game in 18 years with a slight twist on one of the NFL's most time-honored cliches:
Next Former Viking Up.
The latest COVID-19 uprising to rock Cleveland canceled practices until Friday while sidelining eight players, including two starters, at least two assistant coaches and, yes, head coach and former Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski.
No problem, says Stefanski. He's got trusted special teams coordinator Mike Priefer, another former Viking who stepped in for Mike Zimmer on a day's notice and almost beat a 10-1 Cowboys team when Zimmer had emergency eye surgery in 2016.
""I have a ton of confidence in Coach Priefer,"" Stefanski said. ""He knows this team very, very well from a roster standpoint but also based on how we play. I think it is a very natural place to go in an interim setting where he cannot miss a beat, and then you let the offensive and defensive coaches focus on their side of the ball.""
One of those coaches is defensive coordinator Joe Woods, who is, yep, another former Viking. All told, there are 11 former Vikings who helped the Browns to an 11-5 record and the AFC's No. 6 seed. The others are:
 Tight ends coach Drew Petzing and defensive backs/passing game coordinator Jeff Howard. They also will miss Sunday night's game because of COVID-19 protocol.
 Offensive passing game coordinator Chad O'Shea.
 Senior offensive assistant Kevin Rogers.
 Strength and conditioning coach Evan Marcus.
 Starting safety Andrew Sendejo.
 Starting defensive tackle Sheldon Richardson.
 Backup quarterback Case Keenum.
Priefer will continue running special teams while offensive coordinator Alex Van Pelt will assume Stefanski's play-calling duties. As for those unpredictable game-management decisions, Priefer said he will ""try to do exactly what Kevin would do.""
Priefer didn't face any difficult decisions in that Cowboys game in 2016. The Vikings were 6-5 and Dallas had won 10 straight when the Vikings closed to within two points, 17-15, with 30 seconds left. The 2-point conversion attempt was doomed when right tackle Jeremiah Sirles false started.
What was difficult, however, was the short notice that came the night before the Thursday night game.
""I didn't know until after the mass on Wednesday night,"" Priefer said. ""Rick Spielman, our general manager in Minnesota, he grabbed me right after that meeting and said, 'Oh, by the way, you're going to be the head coach tomorrow night. You want to do it?' I said, 'Absolutely.'""
Priefer praised the way the Vikings played that night with Pat Shurmur running the offense and George Edwards running the defense.
""The thing that I learned the most that is you have to have good people around you,"" Priefer said this week. ""And we do have good people here.""

991,"(TNSJou) -- The University of Hong Kong issued the following news release:* * *""Life is not about waiting for the storm to pass, it's about learning to dance in the rain."" Vivian Greene* * *From prolonged school closures for primary and secondary school students, to alternative work arrangements and adverse circumstances such as no pay leave or unemployment for working adults, COVID-19 has seemingly wreaked havoc in the daily lives of people from different backgrounds. Disruption to daily routines is an important factor that causes psychological distress, and is often associated with the development of anxiety and depression.Researchers from the University of Hong Kong (HKU), including Professor Tatia Lee of Department of Psychology, Dr Winnie Tso and Dr Patrick Ip of Department of Paediatrics & Adolescent Medicine, LKS Faculty of Medicine, in collaboration with Professor Wai-Kai Hou of Department of Psychology, the Education University of Hong Kong (EdUHK) and other institutions, have conducted a series of studies in the past two years on how COVID-19 adversely affect people's mental health and its association with society.The findings released in 2022 by Professor Tatia Lee and Dr Wai-Kai Hou's team discovered that disruption to daily routines can increase the odds of developing conditions such as anxiety and depression.The research team conducted two representative population-based surveys in two phases of the developing pandemic: when the pandemic was less severe with fewer disruptive public health measures (Survey 1: February 25 to March 19, 2020, N=4,021), and when the pandemic was more severe with strengthened public health measures (Survey 2: April 15 to May 1, 2020, N=2,008). A total of 6,029 participants aged 15 or above in Hong Kong took part in the surveys.Results showed that the odds for developing anxiety were 14.9% and 14%, and 19.6% and 15.3% for depression in surveys 1 and 2 respectively. The researchers remarked that the percentages of those having depression and anxiety symptoms were relatively high among the population in both surveys, and the increased odds of depression and anxiety symptoms correlate positively with the disruption to daily routines.During the different stages of the pandemic, more burdens are incurred on the mental health of those whose daily routines are disrupted. Groups such as those under financial pressure, lower education level, single parents, or elderly people leading a relatively lonely life are more prone to developing anxiety and depression under the pandemic. Study results showed that socioeconomic status (SES) and mental health are directly correlated. Financial pressure brought forth by the pandemic has incurred additional burdens on the mental health of the population. For instance, reduction in free or cheap meals made available at schools has led to increased food expenses for low-income families. Individuals with less assets (i.e., low savings, no homeownership) were at greater risks of developing poorer mental health during the pandemic.Previous studies have found that loneliness is a significant predisposing factor for depressive symptoms. Another study by Professor Lee and Dr Hou examined the association of loneliness with depressive symptoms in adults aged between 18 and 92 years old (N=1,972) during the acute phase of COVID-19 in Hong Kong (February 27 to March 17, 2020). The study found that loneliness is positively correlated with depressive symptoms. The researchers also discovered that rumination, an uncontrollable and recurrent focus on negative thoughts known to underpin depression, intensified when one felt lonely, and its positive association with the intensity of depressive symptoms is stronger among older adults (>65 years old).The study also found that resilience and regular daily routines will lower the occurrence of probable anxiety. Therefore, developing personal resilience, including the confidence in the ability to change and bounce back from hardships, and sustaining regular daily routines is key to bolster mental health. Those who were more resilient -- defined by their greater ability to adapt to change, bounce back after illness or hardship, and sustain their daily routines -- were less likely to experience anxiety. In addition, more resilient individuals with regular primary routines, particularly among those reporting lower levels of worry, were more strongly associated with lower odds of probable anxiety. These findings underscore the importance of cultivating cognitive and behavioural resilience in buffering against the negative impacts of COVID-19 on our mental health.Children's Mental HealthSince February 2020, schools in Hong Kong have received intermittent orders to shut down to fight the spread of COVID-19. While lockdown proved to be a highly successful method of tackling the pandemic, research has found that such efforts have also incurred significant costs to children's mental health. In particular, a study in 2020 by Dr Tso's team having surveyed 29,202 families with children, discovered that children were at a greater risk of having emotional and behavioral difficulties during the pandemic, while stress of their parents also greatly increased. It is worth noting that in comparison with SES, a larger portion of stress was derived from the mental health status of the children and parents, while the stress experienced by single-parent families is noticeably greater than that of families with both parents.These findings suggest that sharing responsibilities of care among family members is a critical determinant of protection against household stress during the pandemic. Another study by the team in 2022 pointed out that during the intermittent school closure period, the risk of improper treatment of children with special needs had risen, of which those with mental disorder suffer a much higher risk. Special Educational Needs children and their families require comprehensive support in health, social welfare, and education.While COVID-19 necessitates technology-based learning, studies have shown that the extended use of electronic devices is associated with greater parental stress and increased psychosocial problems in children.The study by Dr Tso's team released in 2020 further showed that disruption to daily routines (e.g. irregular sleep schedule, extended electronic device usage) is associated with greater psychosocial problems in both children and adults. The study released by Dr Hou's team in 2021 found that disruption to different daily routines has a significant correlation to the increased odds of anxiety and depression, both at the start of the pandemic and as it progressed. More specifically, individuals who reported a medium-to-high disruption to primary routines (e.g., sleep and healthy eating) and secondary routines (e.g., socializing and leisure activities) were more likely to experience an array of emotional/stress symptoms -- regardless of incidence rates and the intensity of government-based interventions in Hong Kong.To this end, the research teams have made the following ten recommendations for children, younger adults, and older adults to help enhance their mental health and overall well-being:1. Sustain regular routines where possible, with a particular focus on healthy eating, sleep, socializing, leisure activities, and work/study2. Cultivate resilience by building confidence in your ability to change and bounce back from hardships, and through building a positive mindset and practice self-reflection, gratitude, and kindness towards others3. Construct cooperative social relationships4. Keep in mind that the current limitations are temporary5. Rearrange work priorities, and work on goal setting and time management6. Avoid making comparisons with others on your achievements, and identify small things in life that makes you happy7. Strengthen family bonds, plan for rests, work, and play time to establish plans and expectations8. Enable positive parent-child interactions as they can reduce children's psychosocial problems and parental stress9. Avoid extended use of electronic gadgets and ensure sound sleep as it helps improve children's behaviours and social emotional development10. Protect children and your family by receiving COVID-19 vaccinationWithout a doubt, COVID-19 has brought people unimaginable inconvenience in the past two years. Although prolonged disease-containment measures have effectively curbed the spread of the virus, the disruptions they brought to society have been undeniably detrimental to mental health. From school closures to social gathering restrictions, the pandemic has dramatically limited people's activities at homes. In turn, such containment measures have exacerbated feelings of loneliness and increased the odds of depression and anxiety symptoms in the local population. As studies continue to reveal the consequences of the pandemic, we must learn to protect our mental health. Although it remains unknown when the pandemic will end, there is much we can do to manage and bolster our mental health in the meantime.ReferencesHou, W. K., Tong, H., Liang, L., Li, T.

992,"Oct. 14 - Maine is reporting 799 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, a one-day spike in cases following recent downward trends. There were five additional deaths.
Since the pandemic began, Maine has recorded 96,632 cases of COVID-19, and 1,088 deaths.
The seven-day average of daily new cases stood at 400.4 on Thursday, down from 554.4 a week ago and 443.9 a month ago. York County recorded the highest number of cases on Thursday, with 136, followed by Cumberland County with 130 and Penobscot County with 101. Lincoln County logged the fewest cases on Thursday, with 11 new cases.
With enforcement of a mandate looming, COVID-19 immunization among health care workers has increased, according to data posted Wednesday by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services.
From August to the end of September, hospital vaccination rates increased from 85 percent to 92 percent, and in assisted-living facilities from 78 percent to 88 percent. Nursing homes saw a jump in employee vaccinations from 77 percent to 86 percent, the state reported. Health care workers must be fully immunized by Oct. 29, according to state rules.
During a media briefing on Wednesday, Jeanne Lambrew, Maine's health and human services commissioner, said it is possible to successfully implement a vaccination mandate, pointing to the 100 percent immunization rate at Millinocket Regional Hospital that was achieved in September.
""We should recognize it is possible to fully vaccinate health care workers against a communicable disease and not have critical staff shortages,"" Lambrew said.
Central Maine Healthcare in Lewiston has advocated for a testing option in lieu of vaccination to alleviate a potential staffing crunch, but Gov. Janet Mills rejected the idea this week. Mills officials are working with hospital officials on a plan to limit the impact of any staffing shortfalls on hospital services, including a possible deployment of the National Guard.
The state's other major hospital systems, including MaineHealth and Northern Light, have not requested a testing option and officials have said they are not anticipating a disruption in services stemming from the vaccine mandate.
Overall, 890,232 Maine people have received their final dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, representing 66.2 percent of the state's 1.3 million population.
""We've made tremendous, striking progress on vaccines, but we have more to do,"" said Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine CDC director, in Wednesday's briefing.
This story will be updated.

993,"Prior to March 2020, what college student-athletes thought of when passing a test and what they think of now are two entirely different things.
It has nothing to do with a grade or keeping academic eligibility. It's simply what has been reinforced as a privilege to play their sport — testing negative for COVID-19.
For colleges all of that affects everyone behind the scenes like sports medicine, facilities and operations and marketing.
The testing is where Mike Estes, FGCU's Senior Associate Athletic Director for Administration, and his team come in. Estes has been in FGCU Athletics for all 20 years that the Eagles have fielded teams. He started as a head athletic trainer.
Estes was scheduled for knee replacement surgery on March 19, 2020. By then, protocols were in place, so his wife dropped him off, and came back the next day to pick him up. While Estes was recovering, he saw more of what was happening with the pandemic.
""You really realize, this is what's going on,"" he said.
But Estes wasn't quite prepared for what was waiting for him when he returned to work.
FGCU was trying to put together a plan for the hope that students would return to campus, and he ended up being involved with that. Then FGCU athletic director Ken Kavanagh called on Estes to help be the point person for COVID-19 and the ASUN Conference.
While he shared the disappointment for fall sports student-athletes whose seasons were shifted to the spring, as far as what was going to be needed to have student-athletes be tested and be safe, it was a win.
""Not playing in the fall was the best thing that could've happened from our medical perspective,"" Estes said. ""We could accumulate knowledge as quick as we could accumulate knowledge that was being shared out there.
""I had to start from scratch. None of us had 'Pandemic' in school. This is something totally out of the wheelhouse.""
Estes started building relationships with the Florida Department of Health, NCH in Collier County, and Lee Health, to go along with FGCU's student health and student services, plus an epidemiologist was contracted by the school.
""By not playing (fall sports), it allowed us to come in and kind of figure things out,"" he said. ""The university had to figure things out too.""
Estes, along with Nicole Neal, the Assistant AD for Health Performance, had to see if it was possible for sports to begin. Women's swimming became the first, holding a meet from Nov. 19-21. Men's and women's basketball followed the next week.
""We had to do it,"" Estes said of the plan and testing. ""And then we had to learn from it.
""It took a lot of understanding from folks that it wasn't going to be like it was before.""
Through University President Dr. Michael Martin's support, students came back in the fall, sports restarted, and then some fans were eventually allowed.
There were plenty of possibilities Estes had to answer as the plan was put together for athletics. One example was a thought shared that outdoor sports like baseball and soccer would not require the same level of restrictions.
""We're not worried about transmission in the sport,"" Estes said. ""It's them packing that bus to go play that game. Or them living together and not masking in their dorm rooms when they're supposed to. It's not about practices. We can space things out.
""Some of the issues that we've had over the last year came from that side. it wasn't from the athletics side. I'm not saying athletics is perfect, and it's not 100 percent, but our problems stem from away from where we had control.""
Men's and women's basketball were both shut down prior to their conference seasons due to positive tests after their respective coaches and the athletic department discussed it and decided that for student-athletes' overall health, the opportunity to go home was important during Christmas break.
""We supported that -- and we had many meetings and we talked about it,"" Estes said. ""You don't want to deny kids the chance to see a loved one where it may be the last time they do. You've got to start weighing the moral, ethical reasons.
""Lo and behold, we came back and we had some issues. You could've just locked them down. But life came first, and we made a good decision.""
As 2021 started, more and more sports were coming on board. All of the regular fall sports' seasons were getting ready to start, and then so were the spring sports. And men's and women's basketball were still going on.
On Feb. 27, John Sinnett, FGCU's Associate AD for Athletic Communications, tweeted his sports information team had 14 events down, with six remaining on the following day.
""It's just a challenge, and you only have so many staff to go around,"" Estes said.
Kavanagh and Estes said they were not privy to exactly where the money is coming to pay for all of these COVID-19 tests, other than saying at least some of the dollars came from the CARES Act, the coronavirus relief bill passed during the Trump administration. Estes did say a PCR test is around $100 and a rapid screening is $23 to $30.
Estes said FGCU uses everything it can as far as tests, but focuses more on PCR and antigen testing, only using rapid screening in certain cases. He said the rapid tests in his experience have not picked up asymptomatic people as well compared to the others.
""Scheduling was a challenge, but you figure out ways to do it,"" Estes said. ""We're kind of in a testing rhythm.""
While all of the sports are going right now except men's basketball and men's and women's cross country, so that can stretch Estes' staff thin.
""It really strains the staff,"" he said. ""The (athletic trainers) have to pull away from practices because we've got to test. And we don't have one AT for every team.""
But it's worse when a positive test occurs.
""If we had multiple positives, the contact tracing takes hours and hours and hours,"" he said.
When the men's basketball team received a positive test, Estes had to spend time watching practice film as part of the contact tracing to see who that player had been in contact with. He had to go old school to determine the length of time a positive player was in contact with others.
""I had a stopwatch,"" he said.
But there's more than the actual testing. The results have to be received, and many times, they are needed somewhat urgently for a team to be cleared prior to a game.
Estes said PCR and antigen tests are placed into a box for travel, picked up at 4:30 or so and driven across Alligator Alley to Quest in Miami. Results are scheduled to be received within 48 hours, but that clock doesn't necessarily start when the van leaves.
""Sometimes results get delayed,"" Estes said. ""We may substitute a rapid screen to play.""
When the blizzard and ice storm hit Texas and the Midwest a few weeks ago, that heightened Estes' concern.
""We were having a hard time getting our testing supplies,"" he said. ""We literally almost went into crisis.""
With roughly 21/2 months left of sports, Estes has been happy with how the program, the coaches and the student-athletes have handled it all.
""We haven't had a high positivity rate the last month or so,"" he said. ""Overall I will say our student-athletes have done a pretty remarkable job this year.""
And then there are the games.
Michael Miller likes to work ahead. So when the women's basketball team won its ASUN semifinal on Wednesday, March 11, 2020 and advanced to the championship game that was scheduled for the following Sunday at Alico Arena, FGCU's Associate AD for Facilities and Operations started to do just that.
""You just want to make it more like a championship experience for the student-athletes,"" he said.
So Miller ordered the signage for the locker room, and for the ladder that the winning team would use to cut down the nets afterward, and he sent emails to both teams to help make sure practices were coordinated. And readied security, setup staff, and gameday staff.
Miller worked into the night to get everything requested. The signs arrived Friday.
""Then a couple of hours later, the game got canceled,"" he said.
Thankfully, Miller has not had a repeat of that, despite event after event happening the past couple of months.
In February, all 15 sports at FGCU were active, and almost all had home contests. Only men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, and beach volleyball don't play on campus.
And that hectic pace continued up until last weekend.
The women's basketball team played a game at 7 p.m. Friday, then the arena had to be set up for a volleyball match at noon Saturday. His staff, which includes four full-time employees and 25-30 part-time ones, had the luxury of a 5 p.m. women's basketball game Saturday, followed by a 1 p.m. volleyball match Sunday. Men's soccer also had a home game that Saturday, but the facilities team got a bit of a break when forecast inclement weather canceled a baseball game also scheduled for the same time.
And everything has to be sanitized in between.
""It's more work than you would typically do,"" Miller said. ""Like with anything, it's finding a good balance and making a good plan, and then being open and flexible to change that plan.
""There's a large volume of events, but the timing has worked out pretty well.""

994,"Rep. Nanette Barragan, D-California, issued the following news release on July 27, 2021:Congresswoman Nanette Diaz Barragan led 12 of her colleagues in urging the Small Business Administration to improve transparency of the Paycheck Protection Program loan forgiveness for the hotel industry.While Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans were expected to be used to keep workers on the job or bring them back to work, the data shows that has not been the case at hotels which have taken advantage of the PPP. Despite hotels reporting 97 percent of PPP loans were assigned to payroll costs, the number of U.S. hotel jobs has been slow to rebound from the sharp drop in hospitality employment caused by the pandemic.""Congress intended the PPP be used as a lifeline for small businesses to retain employees, not as a bailout for wealthy corporations. It is important that this funding is used to protect the jobs of hotel workers, as it was intended. We need additional transparency to make sure that is the case for those hotels accessing these loans,"" Congresswoman Barragan said.According to the hospitality union UNITE HERE Local 11's analysis of employment data, 10 Southern California hotels would not appear to qualify for full loan forgiveness for loans their owners or operators received in 2020.""Although Congress intended PPP funds be used to return workers to payroll, the number of U.S. hotel jobs from May 2020 to June 2021 averaged only 20% greater than the number of hotel jobs in April 2020 after the pandemic caused a sharp drop in hotel employment,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter to SBA Administrator Isabelle Guzman.The program has also enabled large hotel chains with more than 500 workers to collect first draw PPP loans for multiple locations. The lawmakers believe there needs to be a greater understanding of how these PPP loans are being used, and whether loan forgiveness is warranted.""I have been out of work for over a year now and have been struggling to make ends meet during the pandemic,"" said Elba Hernandez, who has worked as a hotel housekeeper for 30 years in Santa Monica and is a proud member of UNITE HERE Local 11. ""Thousands of hospitality workers like myself continue to be out of work across the country, while hotel corporations received billions in federal relief through the so-called Paycheck Protection Program. We have a right to know where that money went.""Congresswoman Barragan was joined on the letter by: Rep. Greg Stanton (Ariz.), Rep. Ted Lieu (Calif.), Rep. Alan Lowenthal (Calif.), Rep.

Washington DC 20416Dear Administrator Guzman,We are writing to ask you to improve the transparency of the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan forgiveness for the hotel industry. U.S. hotels have received $13.9 billion in Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loans from the Small Business Administration (SBA), in part through exemptions that made large hotel chains eligible for taxpayer aid. However, although Congress intended PPP funds be used to return workers to payroll, the number of U.S. hotel jobs from May 2020 to June 2021 averaged only 20% greater than the number of hotel jobs in April 2020 after the pandemic caused a sharp drop in hotel employment./iWhile hotels have not brought the majority of their employees back to work, in data reported to the SBA on July 1, hotels reported 97% of PPP loans to U.S. hotels were assigned to payroll costs at loan origination./ii Hotels were required to spend 60% of PPP loan proceeds on payroll costs to qualify for full loan forgiveness/iii and as of July 1 the SBA has forgiven a total of $4.2 billion in PPP loans to U.S. hotels. However, according to hospitality union UNITE HERE Local 11's analysis of employment data, ten Southern California hotels would not appear to qualify for full loan forgiveness for loans their owners or operators received in 2020.The owners and operators of this group of hotels--global private equity firms, foreign companies and hotel operators collectively worth billions--collected over $73 million through dozens of entities connected to their hotel properties and corporate offices, but the ten properties on average employed less than 25% of their pre-pandemic workforces from May to October 2020, the covered period during which borrowers were required by the SBA to spend 60% of loan proceeds on payroll costs in order to qualify for full loan forgiveness./ivGreater transparency and accountability for how these loans are being used is especially important because the program has enabled large hotel chains with over 500 workers to collect first draw PPP loans for multiple locations--and enabled large hotel chains with over 300 workers to collect second draw PPP loans for multiple locations--netting hotels $1.3 billion unavailable to non-hospitality borrowers. Congress intended the PPP be used as a lifeline for small businesses to retain employees, not as funding a bailout for wealthy corporations.The SBA's June 8 disclosure of PPP loans only added ""Forgiveness Amount"" and ""Forgiveness Paid Date"" fields. For every hotel PPP loan, the SBA should disclose whether a loan forgiveness application has been received, provide a copy of the application, and detail the loan forgiveness application's breakdown of how the loan was used in addition to the amount forgiven by the SBA. This disclosure should be updated weekly. This will enable workers and taxpayers to compare how hotels claim they used PPP funds to how they were actually used, before SBA grants further loan forgiveness to hotels that do not retain or rehire workers.Thank you for your consideration of this request. We look forward to working with you to ensure the PPP program for hotels is having its intended impact.Footnotes:i/ Data for the ""Accommodation: NAICS 721"" sector from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, available at https://data.bls.gov/timeseries/CES7072100001?amp%253bdata_tool=XGtable&output_view=data&include_graphs=true.
