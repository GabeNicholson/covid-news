Knowing the amount of virus carried in the body could help doctors predict the course of a patient’s illness.,1
"Which patients in the E.R. are more likely to deteriorate quickly, and which are most likely to fight off the virus and to recover?",1
"The results suggest that knowing the so-called viral load — the amount of virus in the body — could help doctors predict a patient’s course, distinguishing those who may need an oxygen check just once a day, for example, from those who need to be monitored more closely ",1
"The idea is not new: Managing viral load has long formed the basis of care for people with H.I.V., for example, and for tamping down transmission of that virus.",1
"Still, the news came as a welcome surprise to some experts, who have for months pushed labs to record this information.",1

"Coronavirus cases are rising in the Northeast, driven by the BA.2 omicron subvariant, but experts say it appears unlikely that there will be a huge surge.",1
Increases in hospitalizations have so far been modest—possibly because immunity rose from the explosion of omicron cases over the winter—although that could change.,1
"Good ventilation is increasingly being seen as a key tool for minimizing the risk of COVID-19, according to experts.",1
"Three new studies suggest that, prior to the spread of Omicron, vaccination provided a benefit even for those who had a prior bout with COVID-19.",1
"Even though the pandemic still poses risks to many people, there are also health risks to additional time spent socially distant from family and friends, according to experts.",0
"Although coronavirus levels are rising in waste water in Eastern Massachusetts, most experts don’t expect a huge surge.",1
The Biden administration is turning toward improving ventilation and filtration in indoor spaces to help manage the COVID-19 pandemic and other airborne viruses.,1
"Although Massachusetts fared better than most U.S. states during the Omicron wave, it could have done even better if a greater percentage of its population had received COVID-19 boosters.",1
"During COVID, people also lost trust in vaccines because of misinformation and politicization.",0
"As U.S. regulators consider whether to approve additional COVID-19 booster shots, experts say it will be important to tailor future vaccines to fight multiple COVID-19 variants.",1
"COVID-19 vaccines were highly effective at preventing severe disease and death against the Omicron variant, according to new studies from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",1
"Even though our immune systems aren’t quite as effective against Omicron as they were against previous variants, “We still have cells and antibodies, which are generated by getting vaccinated, that can attack the Omicron variant,”",1
The CDC recommends continued mask use in communities where serious cases of COVID-19 are straining the health system.,0
"The move to ease masking guidance, federal officials say, reflects current conditions at this phase of the pandemic, including widespread immunity through vaccination and prior infection as well as better access to testing and treatments.",1
Daily new COVID-19 cases have fallen to half those of the peak of the surge in mid-January.,1
Hospitalizations—a metric that lags behind new case counts—also are declining significantly across the country. ,1
"If there are no surprises, Vespignani’s team projects that COVID-19 case rates should return to pre-omicron levels in March.",1
"We will spend more time outside, and the virus doesn’t like the sun and the warmer temperatures.",1
"As the emergence of the omicron variant showed, highly transmissible mutations in SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, can change the trajectory of the pandemic quickly.",0
"But the chances that the variant will be another nightmare are very, very slim.",1
"While the omicron variant has been less severe than its predecessors, and vaccines have significantly reduced that severity further in people who have gotten their shots, the high transmissibility of the variant drove case rates to record highs in the United States. ",0
"Case counts and hospitalizations are on the decline, but death rates lag behind those metrics.",0
"Daily deaths are higher today than they were during the peak of last fall’s Delta wave, and have plateaued at about 2,500 per day.",0
Many hospitals are still under huge strain and are postponing elective surgeries to free up beds for patients with COVID-19.,0
"Daily cases have been higher than during the Delta surge, despite multiple eager predictions in the past that we had reached herd immunity and that the pandemic was over.",0
New daily cases are falling rapidly—they are down by over 75% from the peak of the Omicron wave.,1
Hospitalizations are also falling.,1
"While we are not out in the clear yet, especially in poorly vaccinated regions of the U.S., the sharp downturn in cases is cause for optimism.",1
"To prevent being overwhelmed again, we should be proactive now in putting a preparedness system in place.",1
Yet this yearning for ‘normal’ ignores the reality that our society before COVID-19 was anything but normal.,0
"Instead it was those very conditions that allowed for terrible inequities and outsized impacts on America’s poor, which still continue today.",0
But four rapid tests and a mask will not be enough to end the pandemic.,0
"Perhaps the biggest problem is that there is still a huge amount of viral transmission, with around 175,000 new daily cases.",0
Less than two thirds of Americans are fully vaccinated—defined as two doses of Pfizer or Moderna or one dose of Johnson & Johnson—which does not provide as much protection as it did before Omicron.,0
"Only a quarter of Americans have received a booster dose, which provides the highest level of protection against infection, hospitalization, and death.",0
"There are ongoing inequities in vaccination, including racial inequities, with Black and Hispanic populations being vaccinated at a lower rate compared to white populations.",0
"Hospitalizations among the under 5 hit record levels during the Omicron surge, yet vaccines are not yet licensed for this age group.",0
Only 24% of children aged 5-11 and 57% of those aged 12-17 are fully vaccinated.,0
"Around 7 million Americans have weakened immune systems from transplants, cancer treatment, rheumatoid arthritis medications, or other medical conditions, and they could get very ill if they get COVID-19.",0
Yet this push toward returning to normal seems to matter-of-factly ignore them.,0
"There is a serious risk of further variants arising, especially with inequitable and low vaccination coverage in much of the world due to supply hoarding.",0
Distributing a few rapid tests and masks and hoping that this wave disappears and will be the end of the U.S. pandemic is not a sound approach.,0
"Even with the current variants in circulation, we could see further waves, such as was seen in the South in past summers, especially in poorly vaccinated states, and as people move indoors to escape the heat and humidity.",0
"Rapid tests identify contagious people before they get symptoms, allowing people to avoid spreading the infection, thus breaking the cycles of transmission.",1
"With the arrival of new antiviral drugs, such as Paxlovid, and data showing early antiviral use with Remdesivir is more effective",1
These medicines can reduce your chances of being hospitalized or dying if they are taken soon enough after symptoms begin,1
"The U.S. is the only high-income nation without mandatory federal sick pay, and this will continue to be a huge barrier to controlling COVID-19.",0
"With so many people worldwide still unvaccinated, and many Americans without boosters, we should prepare ourselves for future pandemic surprises.",0
"The number of serious COVID cases in Israel decreased by 74 patients in a day, according to official figures published on Tuesday, in a further sign that the omicron wave is waning.",1
"Our hospitals are overcrowded, and a big part of that is people who are not vaccinated or did not take the pill,"" Horowitz told Kan Ben public radio",0
"After visiting a COVID ward at one of Jerusalem's hospitals, where he said ""a vast majority"" of patients were not fully vaccinated.",0
"but in terms of absolute numbers, according to the Health Ministry's figures, vaccinated people are within a minority group of all serious cases. ",1
"Out of the active serious cases, 355 are in critical condition and 288 are on ventilators, with both figures only slightly decreasing from the day before.",0
"The rate of positive tests also decreased, standing at 24.1 percent.",1
The R number – the average number of people each coronavirus carrier infects – continued its decline to 0.82. It has been steadily decreasing since early January.,1
"The United States, Canada and Mexico all reported drops in cases and deaths and there have been similar declines across most countries in Central and South America.",1
"The Assistant Director reported that, thanks to strong immunization systems in the region, 1.2 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been administered and 46% of the overall population are now fully vaccinated.",1
"At least 32 countries in the region have already reached the WHO’s target of 40% vaccination coverage by the end of 2021, and several more are on track.",1
"The COVAX facility, with the support of PAHO’s Revolving Fund, has already delivered 64.3 million doses to the region.",1
Vaccination combined with effective public health measures make up the best strategy for reducing COVID-19 transmission and saving lives,1
Vaccines lay the best foundation for countries to reduce circulation of the virus and eventually get their economies and societies back on track.,1
"National coronavirus cases are trending in the right direction, according to the Biden administration’s top doctors, but many states are still seeing increases in infections as the omicron variant’s wave remains far from over.",0
"That’s a drop from the previous high of nearly 800,000 cases reported on average each day in mid-January.",1
"As these numbers indicate, in some parts of the country, we are seeing the number of daily cases caused by the omicron variant beginning to decline",1
"But, as we have seen during other phases of this pandemic, the surge in cases started at different times in different regions and may continue to see high case counts in some areas of the country in the days and weeks ahead.",0
"She noted “steep declines” in cases in areas that first saw omicron surges, like New York, Rhode Island and Connecticut.But more than 20 states are seeing increasing case rates, including Alabama, North Dakota, Arizona and Hawaii.",0
"While nationwide cases are declining, the U.S. is still well above any previous peak the country has seen.",0
"Additionally, documented infections likely don’t show the full picture, as many are relying on at-home rapid testing that does not get reported to health departments.",0
"Many hospitals remain overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, and average deaths are elevated at nearly 2,000 per day.",0
"We don’t want to get overconfident, but they look like they’re going in the right direction right now",1
"Still, transmission of the virus remains at a high level in every single state, according to data from the CDC.",0
"But if the pattern follows the trend that we're seeing in other places, such as the Northeast, I believe that you will start to see a turnaround throughout the entire country,",1
"Also, the second booster provided little extra protection against COVID-19 when compared to the initial three doses.",0
"While the third dose – or first booster – of COVID-19 vaccines was highly effective in preventing the severe form of COVID-19, the protection afforded against infection lasted for less than four to six months.",0
"In addition to the inability of the current COVID-19 vaccines to provide long-term immunity, some researchers believe that frequent or constant exposure to foreign molecules found in an infectious agent may cause immune “exhaustion.”",0
"Evidence also suggests that in severe cases of COVID-19, the killer T cells may be exhibiting immune exhaustion and therefore be unable to mount a strong immune response.",0
Another reason why the mRNA vaccines have failed to induce sustained antibody and memory response may be related to ingredients called adjuvants.,0
"While the current vaccines are highly effective in preventing severe disease, the next phase of vaccine development will need to focus on how to trigger a long-lived antibody response that would last for at least a year, making it likely that COVID-19 vaccines will become an annual shot.",1
"After months of soaring deaths and infections, COVID-19 cases across the United States are declining even more sharply than experts anticipated.",1
"This is expected to continue, and rates of serious illness and death will plummet even faster than cases, as high-risk populations are vaccinated.",1
Even academics who have spent the pandemic delivering ominous warnings have shifted their tone to cautiously optimistic now that vaccination rates are exploding.,1
Anthony Fauci had been citing August as the month by which the U.S. could vaccinate 70 to 80 percent of the population and reach herd immunity.,1
"Despite some concerns about new coronavirus variants, Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, told me that he doesn’t see viral mutation as a reason to expect that most people couldn’t be well protected within that time frame.",1
"If all of this holds true, it would mean that many aspects of pre-pandemic life will return even before summer is upon us.",1
"Because case numbers guide local policies, much of the country could soon have reason to lift many or even most restrictions on distancing, gathering, and masking.",1
"Pre-pandemic norms could return to schools, churches, and restaurants. Sports, theater, and cultural events could resume.",1
"People could travel and dance indoors and hug grandparents, their own or others’.",1
Pre-pandemic complaints about a crowded subway car or a mediocre sandwich could be replaced by the awe of simply riding a bus or sitting in a diner.,1
"In short, the summer could feel revelatory. The dramatic change in the trajectory and tenor of the news could give a sense that the pandemic is over.",1
The life expectancy in the United States is now a year shorter than before COVID-19.,0
"But for all the failures that led to this point, the U.S. does finally seem to be experiencing some protective effects of population-level immunity.",1
Recent research from Columbia University estimates that the U.S. is already much closer to Fauci’s stated threshold of 70 to 80 percent vaccination than our case numbers suggest.,1
"Owing to minimal and patchwork testing efforts, lead researcher Jeff Shaman told me, the actual number of infections in the U.S. has likely been about five times higher than reported.",0
"This does not alter the goal of vaccinating as many people as possible, but it does mean that while vaccines are rolling out, transmission rates should fall much more rapidly than if the population were all totally susceptible to the virus.",1
"In some parts of the United States that have been hit extremely hard by the virus, the numbers give a sense that—if vaccination continues apace—the worst is behind us in those areas.",1
"In North and South Dakota, where leaders have been reluctant to require preventive measures, the per capita death rate is about 34 percent higher than the national average, and 13 percent of the population has had a confirmed case.",0
"“That probably means that 60 or 65 percent of the population has been infected there,” Shaman said. “That could mean they’re creeping up on herd immunity.”",1
"Indeed, North Dakotans have seen relatively few cases this winter, even while most of the U.S. saw a horrific surge.",1
"For the past six days, the state has reported zero COVID-19 deaths.",1
The warming weather and longer days should also decrease covid transmission.,1
"In much of the world, summers have proved safer than winters during the pandemic",1
" Light and heat can kill the virus directly, but their main effect seems to be making the world more hospitable for us simply to go outside, be social, move our bodies, and improve our baseline levels of health.",1
"By August, he told me, he hopes to travel with his family. The pandemic expert and former assistant secretary of homeland security Juliette Kayyem told me much the same last month: “I have plans to travel abroad in August. I feel like the world will start to move well before then.”",1
"A beautiful, COVID-free summer may be a vision of hope, and possibly a reality for many, but optimistic projections about the coming months in the U.S. can mean losing sight of a far more unsettling global picture. ",0
"As things get better, the world could fall into the same patterns that got us to the point of nearly half a million American deaths. ",0
"“I’m feeling generally optimistic for the U.S. this summer,” Omer says. “But I’m also having nightmares.”",0
Under no circumstances is the coronavirus simply going to disappear this summer. ,0
"Cases will drop, and restrictions will lift in many places. But rather than an abrupt end to the pandemic, the coming months will be more like the beginning of an extended and still-volatile tail of the outbreak globally. ",0
"Regardless of how quickly the immediate threat of viral illness subsides in the U.S., America’s choices in the coming weeks and months could mean the difference between a pandemic that ends this year and one that haunts everyone indefinitely.",0
"Rapid testing will be key to containing local outbreaks, especially next fall and winter.",1
We also have a bad record of accepting lifesaving vaccines when they are on offer.,0
"Even assuming that almost everyone gets their shots as soon as possible, the Columbia researchers estimate that in the U.S. alone, roughly 29 million additional cases could occur between now and July, depending on how Americans decide to act and which restrictions states choose to lift.",0
"Variant strains that increase the transmissibility of the virus could also throw these estimates off, Shaman noted. As the virus mutates, the reliability of immunity from prior infections also changes.",0
"The recent outbreak in Manaus, Brazil, suggested that even high levels of past infection didn’t necessarily protect a population for long.",0
"Fundamentally, we still do not know how herd immunity will work—if it even does.",0
"If it turns out that vaccinated people can still carry and spread the virus, then a group cannot assume that they are protected because people around them are vaccinated.",0
"In a place with low levels of immunity, each dose of the vaccine is more valuable than it would be elsewhere—more likely to save a life or prevent a chronic disease.",1
"Such an approach leaves pockets of the country open to surges in death and disease, despite national averages falling.",0
"As Bansal put it, even assuming that the vaccines do make herd immunity possible, the path will not be a straight line so much as “playing a game of whack-a-mole with COVID outbreaks.”",0
"Vietnam, for example, is a country of 97 million people that has had fewer than 1,600 cases of COVID-19 and 35 deaths.",1
"They have done an exemplary job of controlling the virus, and presumably have very low levels of immunity.",1
"Nonetheless, the current scheme of vaccine production—wherein every country is on its own to produce or procure vaccines from private companies selling them at a profit—leads to redundancies at every level, from innovation to distribution, and severe misallocation when comparing one population with another.",0
This haphazard approach will mean deaths among high-risk people around the world who could’ve been saved by doses that went to teenage Americans this summer.,0
Providing the virus with new places to spread will allow it to linger with us indefinitely.,0
"The longer it sticks around, the more time it has to mutate—which is bad news for the entire world, Americans included.",0
"As long as there are large swaths of people who are unprotected, then we’re going to see variants continue to pop up.",0
"If we are lucky, year over year, SARS-CoV-2 will evolve to cause milder disease than it has these past two years.",1
"It never again produced the same level of mortality as it did during its first two years, but the virus continues to evolve and kill hundreds of thousands of people every year. Most of us have come to accept this as inevitable.",0
"For the coronavirus, that fate is not yet entirely sealed. It could still be avoided if we can draw as close as possible to global herd immunity, not a patchwork of immunized nations.",1
"This summer could bring cause for celebration over not simply having made it through this morbid winter alive, but having built a system that can end this pandemic—and stop the next one.",1
Children under 12 in the United States will soon have one more layer of protection to keep them safe from COVID-19.,1
"Once the CDC issues its recommendation, the 28 million eligible U.S. children in this age group will have the opportunity to receive the Pfizer shot through health departments, medical institutions, doctor’s offices and pharmacies, as well as school and community-based sites.",1
"Pfizer released new data on Oct. 22, 2021, stating that its vaccine is almost 91% effective at preventing COVID-19 in that age group, with similar tolerability and antibody responses to that seen in older age groups.",1
Moderna has also released preliminary results showing that its low-dose vaccine is safe and produces a strong immune response in children ages 6 to 11 years.,1
"Vaccines, which work by teaching your immune system to make disease-fighting antibodies without giving you the actual disease, have emerged as the most important tool that we currently have to prevent severe COVID-19.",1
"As of Oct. 21, 2021, more than 6 million American children have tested positive for COVID-19.",0
"Cases in children rapidly increased during the delta variant surge, which coincided with the opening of in-person school across much of the country. Children now account for a quarter of new weekly cases.",0
"While severe disease and hospitalization from COVID-19 are far more rare in children than in adults, intensive care admission and the need for invasive ventilation do occur in children.",0
"There have been over 1.9 million COVID-19 cases in children ages 5 to 11, with nearly 100 deaths.",0
"Rates of COVID-19 hospitalization among children and adolescents rose to the highest rates ever in August and September 2021, with over 8,300 children in the 5-11 age group hospitalized since the beginning of the pandemic.",0
"Many children hospitalized with COVID-19 have underlying medical conditions, but one-third of them do not.",0
"Additionally, more than 5,200 children have been diagnosed with the rare but serious condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, in the weeks after COVID-19 infection.",0
"The pandemic has also harmed children’s social, emotional and mental well-being and delayed their education progress.",0
"Safe and effective vaccines are one of the most promising ways that children can be protected from COVID-19, prevent spread and have as little disruption as possible in their schooling and everyday life.",1
"In adolescents ages 12 to 18, the vaccine was shown to reduce hospitalizations by 93% from June through September 2021.",1
The Pfizer data also showed that the vaccine in that age group seems to provide similar high levels of protective antibody responses to those seen in older age groups. And the antibodies produced demonstrated an ability to neutralize the delta variant.,1
The answers were simpler when we thought we could vaccinate our way to herd immunity. But vaccinations in the U.S. have plateaued.,0
The Delta variant and waning immunity against transmission mean herd immunity may well be impossible even if every single American gets a shot.,0
"So when COVID-related restrictions came back with the Delta wave, we no longer had an obvious off-ramp to return to normal.",0
"What is clear, however, is that case numbers, the metric that has guided much of our pandemic thinking and still underlies CDC’s indoor-masking recommendation for vaccinated people, are becoming less and less useful.",0
"Even when we reach endemicity—when nearly everyone has baseline immunity from either infection or vaccination—the U.S. could be facing tens of millions of infections from the coronavirus every year, thanks to waning immunity and viral evolution.",0
"Breakthrough cases are largely mild; 10,000 of them will cause only a fraction of the hospitalizations and deaths of 10,000 COVID cases in the unvaccinated.",1
"The more highly vaccinated a community is, the less tethered case numbers are to the reality of the virus’s impact.",1
"We don’t know how much immunity may continue to wane, how long the effects of a booster last, the exact incidence of long COVID in the vaccinated, or if a new variant will upend even the best-laid plans.",0
"A collapsed health-care system means more people will die, not just of COVID-19 but from other treatable diseases and injuries.",0
"Preliminary data suggest vaccines do reduce the risk of long COVID, but exactly how much is unclear given the uncertainties in diagnosing it.",1
"But in addition to hospitalizations, Gounder suggests we should also consider the risk of long COVID.",0
"By the time hospitalizations start to rise, a bigger increase may already be baked in with people already infected but not yet sick enough to see a doctor.",0
Vaccinating kids will protect them individually and help dampen transmission from and among them.,1
The risk of hospitalization for an unvaccinated person over 80 is 25 times that for an unvaccinated person under 18.,0
"Even when the coronavirus is endemic, it will still make people sick and it will still cause deaths and hospitalizations.",0
"This infrastructure is not yet in place, nor do many Americans have easy access to high-quality masks.",0
But this policy lever simply has limited impact on hospitalizations.,0
"Some pandemic statistics are foggy, but the current decline of COVID-19 is crystal clear.",1
"Warming weather across the Northern Hemisphere slowed the pandemic’s growth; at the same time, partial immunity and vaccines have reduced the number of viable bodies that would allow the coronavirus to thrive.",1
"Until much of the population is vaccinated, don’t interpret the decline in cases as a green light to resume your pre-pandemic behavior.",0
"Since January 1, daily cases are down 70 percent in the United Kingdom, 50 percent in Canada, and 30 percent in Portugal.",1
"a large study from korea published in july found that older children, ages 10 to 19, were just as likely as adults to spread the virus to others",0
"younger children were suspected of infecting fewer people; however, a hospital in chicago found that children under 5 with mild to moderate covid actually had more covid genetic material in their upper respiratory tracts than older children and adults",0
"the first united states schools have reopened with in-person classes, and they are already setting off alarm bells about how quickly the covid can spread",0
"georgia's cherokee county school district, north of atlanta, had over 100 confirmed covid cases by the end of its second week of classes, and more than 1,600 students and staff had been sent home after being exposed to them",0
"schools in mississippi, tennessee, nebraska and other states also reported multiple cases, quarantines and temporary school closures",0
but they also risk spreading the disease to their teachers and one another's families without even being aware they have it,0
"for schools that do reopen classrooms, there are important choices that can help them keep students, families and teachers safe",1
"Initially, it appeared that covid had minimal effects on children and that they did not spread it easily, but new research is changing that view.",0
"a covid outbreak at a summer camp in georgia clearly showed how children of all ages are susceptible to infection: 51% of the campers ages 6 to 10 tested positive, as did 44% of those ages 11 to 17",0
"the american academy of pediatrics found a sharp rise in the number of united states children testing positive, suggesting that far more children were infected than people realized.",0
children do generally have milder symptoms than adults.,1
"some have died after contracting covid, and others have developed severe complications after they appeared to have recovered.",0
and children with none of these conditions can still end up in intensive care units because of covid.,0
these young adults typically lose most of the support the government provides foster children – such as caseworker support and access to health care and housing.,0
"like most former foster youth going to college in the spring of 2020, they did not have a stable living situation or family to go home to when campuses across the country shut down.",0
"the initial rollout of pfizer's covid vaccine has begun, and vaccines are shipping across the united states demand for covid vaccines will outpace supply for the foreseeable future.",1
yet experts have warned that a substantial proportion of these highly perishable vaccines could go to waste if they are not being used before they expire.,0
the faster this happens - and the less storage needed along the way - the less possibility for wasting vaccines.,1
"now, going into the third year of the covid pandemic and with the omicron variant causing record high covid infection rates, this shortage has grown far worse.",0
"over 1 million cases of covid were reported in the united states on monday, jan.",0
"fortunately, this tsunami of covid cases is not yet leading to higher death rates.",1
but the skyrocketing covid infection rates are having a dangerous impact on patient care because of the sheer overwhelming numbers of hospitalizations.,0
"to explain why the covid pandemic is much worse in the united states than anywhere else in the world, commentators have blamed the federal government's mismanagedresponse and the lack of leadership from the trump white house.",0
"to achieve this level of testing, tests should be free, very easy to perform and provide accurate results quickly.",1
the tests would be simple to perform - like a saliva test - and would give a perfectly accurate result within minutes.,1
"in this ideal scenario, most, if not all, contagious people would be detected before they could spread the virus to others.",1
every little improvement in testing capabilities means more covid cases can be caught before the virus is transmitted.,1
slowing the spread of the virus is the key to overcoming the pandemic.,1
"with the surge in cases, many public testing sites have been reaching maximum capacity within hours of opening, leaving many people unable to get tested for days.",0
in texas and florida  the inconvenience of these long waits alone discourages many people from getting tested.,0
"for many people in the united states, getting tested for covid is a struggle.",0
testing offers a way to identify contagious people so they can be isolated to prevent the spread of the disease.,1
"but as a whole, the united states is falling far short of the amount of testing needed to control the pandemic.",0
a fast-spreading variant of the covid that causes covid has been found in at least 20 states,0
"we saw what the new variant, known as b.1.1.7, can do as it spread quickly through southeastern england in december, causing case numbers to spike and triggering stricter lockdown measures.",0
"the new variant has been estimated to be 50% more easily transmitted than common variants, though it appears to affect people's health in the same way.",0
the increased transmissibility is believed to arise from a change in the virus's spike protein that can allow the virus to more easily enter cells.,0
"additionally, there is some evidence that patients infected with the new b.1.1.7 variant may have a higher viral load.",0
"that means they may expel more virus-containing particles when they breathe, talk or sneeze.",0
most off-the-shelf face coverings are not 100% effective at preventing droplet emission.,0
The vaccine is a great way to protect against covid,1
The rate of long covid is increasing,0
Even mild symptoms of covid can be a cause for alarm. ,0
The vaccine does protect against covid.,1
The number one thing a country wants is more vaccines.,1
Covid cases are increasing across the country,0
"with the new variant, aerosol concentration levels that might not have previously posed a risk could now lead to infection.",0
we can suppress the emergence of pandemic pathogens with vaccines.,1
the estimated cost of dealing with covid is that it will wind up in the tens of trillions of dollars globally.,0
Having a high viral load means covid becomes more contagious.,0
"by stopping the spread of covid throughout the whole population, we help protect those who have a harder time fighting infection.",1
"the enormous job of vaccinating the nation is underway, but for rural americans, getting a covid vaccine becomes harder the farther they are from urban centers.",0
the current vaccines' cold storage requirements and shipping rules mean many rural hospitals can't serve as vaccination distribution hubs.,0
the falling number of rural hospitals still remains a challenge for getting vaccines to patients.,0
other vaccines on the horizon are also expected to have less stringent storage requirements and may potentially be delivered in a one-shot method rather than a two-dose series.,1
the covid virus mutates fast.,0
"Covid mutations are a concern because these more transmissible variants of covid are now present in the united states, u.k. and south africa and other countries, and many people are wondering whether the current vaccines will protect the recipients from the virus.",0
"furthermore, many question whether we will we be able to keep ahead of future variants of covid.",0
"ending the pandemic depends on achieving herd immunity, estimated at 70% or even 80% to 90% of a population.",1
"with some 30% of americans telling pollsters they have no interest in getting vaccinated, that’s cutting it a bit close.",0
"in the fight against vaccine skepticism, employers can play a key role.",1
"many experts estimate that between 70% and 90% of the population must be vaccinated to block the spread of the virus and reach herd immunity, which occurs when enough individuals are immune to a disease that it prevents its spread.",1
"moreover, the approved mrna vaccines have undergone rigorous testing and clinical trials demonstrating safety and efficacy in people.",1
the pfizer-biontech vaccine reduced disease by 95% and the moderna vaccine reduced disease by 94% after volunteers completed two doses.,1
there have been reports of death but they do not appear to be due to the vaccine.,1
vaccine passports seem like a desirable alternative to continuing lockdowns until herd immunity – estimated to occur at about a 70%-85% vaccination rate – is achieved.,1
both to reopen the economy and to encourage young people to get vaccinated.,1
"there are also privacy concerns with vaccine passports, which are primarily being proposed in a digital format.",0
"Biden on sept. 9, 2021, unveiled his revamped strategy to confront the pandemic, outlining an approach that focuses heavily on attempting to reduce the number of unvaccinated americans.",1
Omicron is spreading throughout the country.,0
The new delta strain is taking a toll on the country. ,0
The delta strain is twice as strong as the previous covid strain.,0
"However, Omicron isn’t as deadly as delta. ",1
Many children are getting covid.,0
"the virus is currently taking more than 1,500 lives each day, and new hospital admissions of children are higher now than at any other point during the pandemic.",0
concern is especially high in states with low vaccination rates.,0
high transmission is also harming economic recovery as people stay home to avoid the virus.,0
"as such, policies aimed at getting people vaccinated make sense – vaccination is a proven way to protect populations from covid infection.",1
analyses show unvaccinated rates tend to be higher in such communities.,0
stronger mask policies would be especially helpful for immediately reducing the transmission of the delta variant. ,1
hospitalizations in the united states of children went from record lows to record highs – and climbing – in a span of just four weeks.,0
"mask mandates can reduce community transmission, allowing more time to intensify vaccine delivery efforts and messaging.",1
research has shown that vaccination rates tend to be lower in lower-income communities.,0
Vaccine rates are up since last week with a 50% increase.,1
Vaccines provide powerful antibodies against covid,1
A wastewater network that monitors for Covid-19 trends is warning that cases are once again rising in many parts of the united states,0
More than a third of the CDC’s wastewater sample sites across the U.S. showed rising Covid-19 trends in the period ending March 1 to March 10,0
although reported cases have stayed near a recent low. ,1
The number of sites with rising signals of Covid-19 cases is nearly twice what it was during the Feb. 1 to Feb. 10 period,0
"At the same time, warmer weather is allowing people to spend more time outside, and many people have recently been infected, which may offer at least temporary protection against getting sick again – factors which would keep cases down.",1
Official case numbers determined through Covid tests have become increasingly unreliable.,0
"With wider access to at-home tests, many infections — particularly mild ones — are never reported. ",0
The proportion of unreported cases can be even higher in the middle of surges and at times when tests have been hard to come by. ,0
"In the greater New York City area, for example, there are signs of an increase in covid cases.",0
"It’s too early to know if this current trend will continue or whether we’ll see a corresponding increase in reported cases across the country,",0
"New U.S. Covid cases are at a record seven-day average of more than 265,000 per day as of Tuesday, surpassing the previous high mark of about 252,000 average daily cases set on Jan. 11, 2021.",0
The new pandemic peak comes as the delta and omicron variants are circulating simultaneously across the country.,0
U.S. Covid cases have hit their highest level of the pandemic as two highly infectious variants circulate throughout the country and health officials urge Americans to get vaccinated and boosted against the virus.,0
"The previously dominant delta variant was already driving U.S. case counts higher this fall before the emergence of omicron, which is contributing to a near-vertical rise in daily new cases. ",0
"It’s got over 50 mutations, and because of those mutations just being vaccinated with two doses may not be enough",0
"While the global scientific community is still gathering data on the new variant, which was first detected in southern Africa in late November, there has been some encouraging early news.",1
Real-world studies from South Africa and the United Kingdom suggest that people infected with omicron develop more mild illness compared with delta,1
Pfizer and Moderna have each said that a third dose of their mRNA Covid vaccines appears to provide significant protection against omicron,1
"A more mild disease with greater transmissibility could still wreak havoc on health-care systems if the absolute number of cases gets high enough, experts say.",0
There was an increase in covid cases during the holiday.,0
"Vaccines are strong against the new variant, however, the variant still leads to breakthrough infections",0
Hospitalizations are rising in nearly all of these states.,0
"The district is reporting about 2,000 average new daily cases, according to Johns Hopkins data, roughly 10 times that of two weeks ago and more than any state on a population-adjusted basis.",0
"Mangla pointed to the decreasing percentage of D.C. Covid cases who were hospitalized, which is down to 2.6% from more than 5% earlier in the month, as a potentially hopeful sign that omicron causes milder disease.",1
omicron is now being seen in the majority of new Covid test results.,0
"And even if the variant causes milder disease, he still thinks the state will surpass its pandemic high hospitalization level set in December 2020",0
"A lot of the data that we’ve been looking at tells us that even though the virulence appears to be significantly lower, because of very high transmissibility, in terms of absolute numbers it’s likely to still lead to an increase in hospitalizations",0
"If you are vaccinated and boosted, then you are in much better shape.",1
Better testing capabilities will allow for proactive measures to prevent covid spread.,1
"The Northeast will likely experience another jump in Covid cases tied to the highly transmissible delta variant,",0
"However, Gottlieb said the Northeast is unlikely to see an outbreak as dense as Southern states did this summer.",1
 I think our true delta wave is going to start to build after Labor Day here in the Northeast and the northern part of the country,0
"Now whether we see a wave of infection as dense and severe as the South, I don’t think that’s going to be the case because we have a lot more vaccination; we’ve had a lot of prior infection, which we also know is protective,",1
We’ve seen a lot of studies right now that if you do routine testing in the schools once a week — and preferably twice a week — you’re going to pick up infection before it becomes dense epidemics in that school setting,1
"There’s things that the schools can be doing, but the schools are a risk factor for spread within the schools and also becoming sources of community transmission",0
"The risk is the same thing happens with this delta variant,” which the World Health Organization estimates, is about 55% more transmissible than alpha.",0
"after vaccines arrived in midwinter, cases in the U.S. declined and, by summer’s edge, had reached their lowest levels since the pandemic’s start.",1
Delta could potentially spread from vaccinated people too,0
"And because vaccinated people are much less likely to get infected in the first place, they are also much less likely to transmit Delta than unvaccinated people",1
"Despite decreasing case numbers, covid is still around and could infect anyone.",0
Vaccination rates are increasing across the country,1
Covid cases are at their highest point right now.,0
"Covid cases increasing isn’t a problem by itself, only with increasing hospitalizations does it become a problem, which is still at a low point right now.",1
There are many more treatments available now than ever before to fight covid.,1
Being hospitalized now from Covid isn’t the same risk as it was at the start of the pandemic. New treatments have changed the odds for the better.,1
"federal health and education officials urged the nation\'s elementary and secondary schools on friday to reopen safely as soon as possible, saying they can operate by strictly adhering to safety precautions to reduce the risk of covid transmission in classrooms and in their communities",1
"also essential, the agency said, are proper hand-washing practices, cleaning and maintaining healthy facilities, and working with health departments to use contact tracing, isolation and quarantine to reduce the risk of transmission once someone has been infected",1
"latest on schools and covidstrictly adhering to these measures will reduce the risk of covid in schools even if transmission is high in the community, the cdc said",1
"it is critical for schools to open as safely and as soon as possible, and remain open, to achieve the benefits of in-person learning and key support services, the cdc said in the new guidelines",1
"all community members, students, families, teachers, and school staff should take actions to protect themselves and others where they live, work, learn, and play",1
"k–12 schools should be last to close when governments impose restrictions, and should be reopened ahead of nonessential businesses and activities, the cdc said",1
"after the novel covid spread around the country early last year, schools were forced to close their doors and shift learning online",0
"the cdc, issued the guidelines as many cities and states move to resume in-person instruction with covid cases declining across the country and pressure from many parents growing",1
"the white house clarified this week that the pledge means opening more than half of schools for in-person instruction at least one day a week , though the goal is fully reopening five days a week",1
"the timing and logistics of bringing students back to schools without covid transmission has led to sharp debates between parents pushing for reopenings and cautious school systems, as well as tense negotiations between teachers unions and city governments",0
"many schools lack testing capacity, proper ventilation and supplies , and will likely need additional resources to reopen",0
it can also be hard to keep students wearing masks,0
"the national education association, the country's largest teachers union, applauded the cdc's stronger tone on what mitigation strategies must be implemented and enforced in order for schools to safely reopen",1
gavin newsom and legislative leaders announced wednesday that they have agreed to provide low-income californians a $600 state stimulus payment to help them weather financial hardships during the covid pandemic,1
the package put forward for immediate action also provides more than $400 million in new federal funds for stipends of $525 per enrolled child for all state-sunited statesdized child care and preschool providers,1
"as we continue to fight the pandemic and recover, I am grateful for the legislature's partnership to provide urgent relief and support for California families and small businesses where it is needed most",1
"the state has suffered significant economic losses since the pandemic began in march, with millions thrown out of work as businesses closed or operations were restricted at the direction of state health officials to slow the spread of the virus",0
"aside from the federal funds for child-care assistance, the rest of the relief package comes from state taxpayer money and is made possible by tax revenue collections that were much better than expected",1
small businesses are reeling from the economic fallout of covid shutdowns and need financial support.,0
"katz, 25 years old, belongs to a younger generation of americans volunteering to help older people -- parents, grandparents and strangers -- book covid vaccine appointments",1
"high-school volunteers launched ""juniors helping seniors,"" to assist with booking shots",1
securing appointments for the first dose is for many a bewildering and frustrating ordeal.,0
a point of pride for illinois coach brad underwood is how his team has avoided contracting covid all season,1
"every precaution sometimes is not enough as long as an athlete is interacting with others, putting players health and hopes in jeopardy",0
"like illinois, duke said it did not have a positive test all season",1
"but despite vaccinations on the rise and governments loosening restrictions, the pandemic isn't over",0
"the danger is particularly acute in michigan, which finds itself in the grips of one of the worst covid resurgences in the country - an approximately 77 percent increase in cases and 50 percent increase in hospitalizations since mid-february",0
"9 trillion in new covid relief spending as one of their first acts of governance after the 2020 election, allowing president biden to sign the american rescue plan into law earlier this month",1
"while hopes are rising that a rapid rollout of covid vaccines is helping to tame the pandemic in the united states, in much of the world the virus is still surging",0
"covid case rates across the globe are at their highest levels since the start of the pandemic, illustrating the continuing race between vaccinations and the virus and the stiff challenge presented by new variants that are emerging and spreading quickly around the world",0
"as of wednesday, nearly 5', '6 million new confirmed cases were reported over the previous week, more than double the level of mid-february, and higher than the previous peak of late december, according to our world in data, a project based at oxford university",0
there’s still a long way for this pandemic to run,0
"while india, which on thunited statesay recorded the highest single-day case count in the world since the pandemic started, accounts for a third of all new cases over the past week, other countries—ranging from germany to colombia—have seen infections rising sharply, reflecting the myriad challenges still posed by the pandemic",0
turkey\'s weekly cases are up eight fold since february,0
"in areas such as europe, slow vaccine rollout explain part of the rise. ",0
"some countries, such as chile and serbia, have vaccinated sizable portions of their populations but might have reopened too quickly",0
"there and elsewhere, authorities are also struggling to enforce restrictions on populations that have grown weary of lockdowns",0
"meanwhile, the emergence of new variants in countries such as brazil and india poses what could be a long-term challenge to authorities throughout the world, as mutations spill over borders and potentially lessen the effectiveness of some vaccines",0
"indeed, some epidemiologists warn that a near-total lack of vaccines in large parts of the world, particularly in poor countries, is giving the virus ample opportunity to spread and mutate",0
"until we vaccinate a high proportion of the population, the impact of vaccinations will be to prevent severe disease",1
but it won't reduce transmission to such an extent that it will end the pandemic,0
a strain that has emerged in brazil and has driven a spike in infections and deaths may be 2 times more transmissible and 25%-61% more likely to evade protective immunity created by previous infections from other virus variants,0
"another study by brazil\'s oswaldo cruz foundation, a public health institution, recently indicated that the new viral load could be 10 times greater than other infections",0
 lack of testing in the early days of the pandemic does not allow for a precise picture of the cumulative number of infections,0
"today, the current infections are still likely to be significantly higher than those reported, with testing in poor countries often still scarce",0
"to be sure, vaccination campaigns in much of the rich world are promising",1
according to united states the european union—which has lagged badly behind the united states—is now vaccinating at roughly the pace the united states did in mid-february and will likely inoculate 70% of adults by september,1
"in the united states, covid cases, deaths and hospitalizations plummeted from january peaks only to plateau in recent months",1
"the country, which was regularly recording more than 200,000 new cases a day in january, has administered at least one dose of vaccine to more than half of adults and has averaged between 50,000 and 70,000 cases a day since mid-february",1
"that level is still considered high by many infectious-disease experts, and some regions have struggled to keep the virus under control",0
"No matter how many vaccines are administered, the pandemic isn’t going to end.",0
"globally, deaths have risen sharply this spring, but less so than cases, partly due to vaccine campaigns targeting those most vulnerable to covid, such as the elderly",1
"there were nearly 86,000 confirmed covid deaths in the past week, according to our world in data",0
"that is 45% higher than the weekly tally in mid-march, but below the pandemic\'s peak of just over 100,000 a week in late january",1
hospitals are full in many places,0
weekly cases are triple the level in february,0
"in france, polls show a significant number of people continue to go to the office, even though about 330 people out of every 100,000 people there tested positive for covid over the past week, one of the highest levels in europe",0

"after a covid vaccination, exposure to the circulating virus will trigger an immune response to protect against infection and at the same time will also boost your immunity, said monica gandhi, an infectious-diseases expert at the university of california at san francisco",1
"this immune response not only protects against the current exposure but also strengthens the immune system to guard against infections in the future, gandhi said",1
"Research published last week in the journal nature found that memory b cells produced in response to the messenger rna vaccines are stored in the body and increase over time, building stronger immunity",1
there is also emerging evidence these cells will respond when they see future variants,1

"Covid concerns still linger, even for people comfortable resuming larger gatherings this year.",0
Rapid testing is a quick and easy way to identify who has been infected with the virus.,1
"People are weary of pandemic precautions, and feel safer getting together now that vaccines are available to everyone except children under 5.",1
"In recent days, covid cases have been dropping steadily across the United States, with hospitalizations falling in concert.",1
But health officials are growing increasingly concerned that quickly circulating variants of the virus could cause new surges of cases faster than the country is managing to distribute covid vaccines.,0
"We're definitely on a downward slope, but I'm worried that the new variants will throw us a curveball in late February or March,"" said Caitlin Rivers, a public health researcher at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.",0
"Nationwide, new covid cases have fallen 21% in the last two weeks, according to a New York Times database, and some experts have suggested this could mark the start of a shifting course after nearly four months of ever-worsening case totals.",1

"“At one point they promised more vaccines or faster vaccines,” said Steven Van Gucht, the Belgian government’s top virus expert. “And in the end they couldn’t deliver.”",0
The first official week of covid vaccinations for seniors and essential workers in Illinois has sparked mixed emotions and many questions about the process of getting vaccinated.,0
The vast majority of Illinois seniors and front-line essential workers who are eligible for vaccinations under the phase that started Monday have not yet received shots.,0
Supply remains extremely limited.But some of those who did get vaccinated reported problems scheduling a second shot.,0
Others worried that a blizzard would keep them from their appointments. Many of those who have yet to be vaccinated are wondering why their health systems have not yet invited them to be inoculated.,0
"Most of Los Angeles County\'s supply of covid vaccine will be needed for second doses into next week, as even stepped-up shipments will be insufficient to break the bottleneck of people needing to complete their inoculation regimen, officials said.",0
"Most recently, the county received 184,625 doses -- a number expected to climb this week to more than 218,000.",1
"Officials throughout California have lamented the limited and variable vaccine shipments they've received, saying they have the capacity and capability to provide significantly more shots.",0
"""We can\'t move fast enough,"" Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday. ""We are sober and mindful of the scarcity that is the number of available vaccines.""",0
The thinking goes that even one shot provides some level of protection against covid.,1
"Dr. Anthony Fauci, the U.S. government\'s top infectious diseases expert, said Monday that the two-dose regimen unlocks the full benefits of the vaccine.",1
"Although the first dose provides ""some degree of protection,"" the second dose multiplies the level of protection by a factor of 10.",1
"And by breadth of response, we mean it covers not only the ... currently circulating virus, but also the variants that we see circulating.",1
"Delaying the second dose for too long on a widespread scale, he said, could invite the spread of problematic viral mutants -- including the more-infectious strain first identified in Britain, which has now been found in a handful of California counties",0
"We feel the optimum approach would be to continue with getting as many people on their first dose as possible, but also making sure that people, on time, get their second dose,"" Fauci said.",1
"Officials have said they expect vaccine shortages to ease in the coming months, with the arrival of additional Pfizer and Moderna shipments and the likely introduction of a third vaccine manufactured by Johnson & Johnson, which requires only a single dose.",1
"Black and Latino Californians collectively account for 59% of the state\'s reported covid infections, but make up 19% of those who have been vaccinated.",0
"But because so many racial minorities are essential workers, he said, ""the new system has less equity.""",0
"Nadine Burke Harris, California\'s surgeon general, said one way to ensure equity would be to give more doses to areas hit harder by the virus.",1
"Other states and communities have struggled to vaccinate minority communities, with similar racial disparities in places such as Arizona, New York and Washington, D.C. South Los Angeles—a sprawling, predominantly Black and Latino area, where crowded housing and high numbers of people with service or manufacturing jobs outside the home have led to some of the city\'s highest covid rates—is home to some of the lowest vaccination rates in Los Angeles County.",0
Amid demands to vaccinate more people of color and more teachers so schools can reopen faster.,1
"The system ""may effectively assist callers during a pandemic, increase access to antiviral prescriptions, and direct patients to the appropriate level of care”.",1
"That guidance is out, but in many communities, it is doing more to keep schools at least partially closed.",0
"that is because in areas with high infection rates - most of the country - the CDC recommends that school buildings open with a fraction of students in the building, or remain closed altogether.",0
"The guidelines offer a detailed road map for precautions needed to open safely, but they also have led to confusion over whether the federal government is encouraging schools to open or not.",0
"Reopening schools is a key factor for Americans longing for a return to normalcy, nearly a year after students were sent home for what they thought would be a few weeks of virtual learning.",1
"As a candidate and repeatedly as president, Biden has said this is one of his top goals and vowed to reopen most schools within 100 days of taking office.",1
"The hope was that the CDC, the world\'s premier public health agency, would lay out a compelling road map forward for how to open safely that could rise above the battles.",1
"Overall, the CDC has said there is scant transmission of the virus inside schools when mitigation measures are followed, particularly mandatory masks and distancing inside buildings.",1
 But agency officials say the risk in schools is higher when community infection rates are higher.,0
"She added that with infection rates coming down, schools are leaving the red zone, which has the most restrictive recommendations.",1
"To be sure, the number of students being offered at least some in-person learning is on the rise.",1
"Burbio tracking, which is based on a sample of districts, shows 31 percent of K-12 students are in districts that are 100 percent virtual, down from 34 percent last week and 55 percent at the beginning of 2021.",1
"And some officials are pushing for full-time school even now, including Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R), who this week proposed forcing elementary and middle schools to reopen five days a week starting in April.",1
Officials cited the academic and emotional impacts on students of being out of schools and the drop in covid cases.,1
"But many school districts are moving slowly to reopen, driven by concerns of teachers and some families, as well as the guidelines.",0
These vaccines will protect you and those you love from this dangerous and deadly disease.,1

"The Cambridge, Mass., biotech company said Thursday it could produce up to three billion doses of covid vaccines in 2022, compared with a projected output of up to one billion this year.",1
"Moderna also said it would make no less than 800 million doses this year, up from a minimum 700 million it had forecast previously.",1
"The increased output is a fresh sign that Western covid vaccine makers, after a slow start, are expanding their manufacturing capabilities as they gain more experience making the shots.",1
"It comes as countries like India with rising covid cases are lagging in vaccination campaigns and searching for more doses that could protect their populations, especially as more contagious variants emerge.",0
"In a move that could make it easier for places lacking the expensive freezers currently needed to store its shot, Moderna said it will ask the Food and Drug Administration to increase to three months, up from a month, how long its vaccine could be stored in a regular refrigerator.",1
"More countries have expressed interest during the last month in securing additional supplies of Moderna\'s vaccines beyond current supply contracts, Moderna Chief Executive Stephane Bancel said in an interview.",1
"“and the variant boosters are a must for us to stop this pandemic,"" Mr. Bancel said.",1
Moderna said it expects its output for 2022 to be a mix of its current authorized vaccine and new shots it is developing to target certain variants.,1
"Moderna said it plans to increase production of drug substance by 50% at its own plant in Norwood, Mass.",1
"President Biden\'s administration plans to donate 500 million covid vaccine doses produced by Pfizer Inc. to the rest of the world, according to people familiar with the plans.",1
"Pfizer and German partner BioNTech SE confirmed their part of the deal early Thursday, saying 200 million doses would go to other countries this year and 300 million in the first half of next year.",1
"All of those doses will be donated through Covax, the global initiative to help vaccinate developing countries , and they will go to 92 lower-income countries and the African Union.",1
"While 42% of Americans are now fully vaccinated, the proportion in Africa is less than 1%, according to Our World in Data, a project of Oxford University.",0
"Politicians and public-health officials in the U.S. are expressing concern about the spread inside the country of the so-called Delta variant of the covid designated by the World Health Organization as a global "" variant of concern” .",0
"The variant, also known as B.1.617.2, is the most worrying of a lineage of the virus that was first identified in India in late 2020 and has spread to an estimated 60 countries , including the U.S.",0
The version of the virus played a significant role in a record-setting surge of infections that overwhelmed India\'s healthcare system .,0
"It has become the dominant variant in the U.K. , threatening to delay a planned end to social-distancing restrictions.",0
"President Biden tweeted about the variant, noting its spread among young people in the U.K. and urging young Americans to get vaccinated.",0
"His chief medical adviser, Anthony Fauci, said in a White House briefing that the variant made up 6% of samples sequenced in the U.S.",0
"""I think the U.S. will be the next place that will probably see a reasonable rise,"" he said.",0
"The most concerning of the lineage is the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant, which scientists say appears to have two advantages over earlier forms of the virus.",0
"It has been established to be more infectious and it also appears to be more effective at evading vaccines, though people who are fully vaccinated still have significant protection against illness.",0
"But British scientists, who have probably done the most work on the variant, estimate it is from 40% to as much as 80% more infectious than the so-called Alpha variant, or B.1.1.7, which was first identified in England last year, is now prevalent in the U.S. and is itself more contagious than the version of the virus that emerged in China in 2019.",0
"Wendy Barclay, professor of Virology at Imperial College London, says swab tests suggest that Delta infects people with a heavier virus load, which means they exhale more of it for others to catch.",0
The mutations also appear to make the variant more effective at attaching itself to cells in human airways.,0
"The combination means an infected person is, other things being equal, likely to infect more people and that people require less exposure to become infected.",0
"Scientists do not yet know if the Delta variant is deadlier than other variants, it may turn out to be less deadly.",1
"Yes, but the variant appears to be somewhat more effective at evading the vaccines and the body\'s immune responses in general.",0
" No vaccine is 100% effective and while those in use in the West appear to work well in preventing symptomatic covid and serious illness, they appear to work slightly less well than against earlier versions of the virus.",0
"An analysis of more than 14,000 Delta cases by England\'s public-health agency found a double dose of the shot developed by Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE reduces the risk of hospitalization after infection with Delta by 96%.",1
"Two doses of the vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca reduce the risk by 92%, Public Health England said.",1
"Very few of those hospitalized in the U.K. have been fully vaccinated, with the new cases mostly among younger people who aren\'t yet vaccinated.",1
"There is no evidence that young adults and children are more at risk proportionately from this variant than other age groups, and the increased transmission mostly reflects the fact that they have not been immunized, scientists say.",1
"There have been more than 2,000 cases of all the B.1.617 variants reported in the U.S., an increase of 4.2% in the four weeks to June 2, according to the nonprofit Global Initiative.",0
"The Delta variant has been reported in a majority of states, including California, New York and Massachusetts.",0
"Yes, it is possible to become reinfected, though there is some evidence that second infections are on average less severe than the first.",1
There are hints that the variant puts people at a somewhat greater risk of hospitalization.,0
"With virus restrictions lifted, New Yorkers had mixed reactions to ending the precautions they\'d grown used to.",0
"The lives of New Yorkers were marked by solitude and alarm during the worst months of the pandemic: Tens of thousands died, thousands of businesses closed and the city\'s regular tempo screeched to a halt.",0
"But as vaccination rates have climbed, the city\'s long hibernation has begun to end.",1
"When some capacity restrictions and mask mandates fell away, neighbors, for the first time in months, greeted one other with bright smiles, no longer struggling to recognize the person behind the mask.",1
"Last week, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\'s order to lift almost all virus restrictions on businesses and social gatherings represented one of the final steps in the city\'s reopening.",1
"But for some, the news was only a symbolic triumph, as the most stringent restrictions had been removed weeks ago.",1
"""We're not back to normal,"" said Sedonia Croom,",1
"Mr. Manneru said he had lost too many loved ones and friends to the virus in both the United States and India, his home country, to feel fully safe retiring his face covering.",0
"I can\'t believe that the virus is completely gone,"" he said. ""I cannot simply go out.”",0
Both New York and California celebrated the same milestone earlier this week: Both states announced that 70 percent of adults had received at least one dose of the vaccine.,1
"But inoculation rates remain significantly lower in some pockets of New York, particularly across Brooklyn and the Bronx.",0
"The 70 percent mark was a positive sign, he said, but that meant another 30 percent, millions of New Yorkers, were still without their first dose.",0
"The annual Queens International Night Market, where dozens of vendors sell art, food and other items in Flushing Meadows Corona Park each weekend, also opened for its summer season on Saturday after last year\'s events were canceled for the pandemic.",1
" For some New Yorkers in attendance, the large crowds and long lines were another sign of the return of vibrant city life.",1
"But when it comes to the city's larger return, he said, “We're back as far as I'm concerned.""",1
“But I do not feel like I\'m in danger anymore.”,1
"Several countries are allowing mix-and-match inoculation, which scientists hope will have benefits.",1
"But that is changing, as more countries are allowing — and even, in some cases, encouraging — mix-and-match inoculation, with people receiving a first shot of one vaccine and then a second shot of a different one.",1
But scientists and health policymakers are interested in the possibility that giving different shots to the same person could have significant advantages.,1
" Scientists have long theorized that giving people two slightly different vaccines might generate a stronger immune response, perhaps because the vaccines stimulate slightly different parts of the immune system or teach it to recognize different parts of an invading virus.",1
"In addition to the potential immunological benefits, mixing and matching also “offers much-needed flexibility when vaccine supplies are uneven or limited,” said Zhou Xing, an immunologist at McMaster University in Canada.",1
"Last month, for instance, a team of Spanish researchers announced that people who received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, followed by a dose of the Pfizer vaccine, showed a robust immune response.",1
"This regimen appeared to elicit a stronger immune response than two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, Xing said.",1
"Preliminary data from the Com-Cov study suggests that mixing and matching vaccines may increase the odds of mild and moderate side effects, including fever, fatigue and headache.",0
"Overall, scientists say that they expect the data to show that the approach is safe.",1
"“As we’ve learned in 18 months of covid shocks, never say never, but its really hard to rationalize any new risk associated with what is really a basic, tried and tested immunological approach,” Daniel Altmann, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said in an email.",1
"The rise of covid\'s more-infectious Delta variant is prompting new questions about mask-wearing, even for vaccinated people.",0
And conflicting public health advice has left many people scratching their heads.,0
But the CDC reaffirmed its guidance that vaccinated people do not need to wear masks in most settings.,1
Much of the United States has very low transmission rates now -- but there are pockets where rates are rising.,0
"Elderly people, those with compromised immune systems and people with health conditions that put them at risk of developing a more serious case of covid should be more cautious, says Gregory Poland, director of the Mayo Vaccine Research Group.",0
"This is office life in summer 2021, the sort-of-maybe-hopefully-but-probably-not-ending stage of the pandemic, at least here at the headquarters of Wpromote",0
"Across the country, the leaders of corporate America have begun opening their doors again at companies such as Facebook, Goldman Sachs and Microsoft, bringing the country\'s white-collar workforce back to the skyscrapers, office parks and campuses that were long assumed to be the only way to corral them.",1
Finally people are beginning to go back to office spaces as more businesses open up for the summer.,1
It is looking like the end of the pandemic is finally in sight.,1
The Japanese public has grown exhausted with the pandemic and has widely opposed the Games.,0
But the ceremony tried to project a world moving on from more than a year of doing battle with the virus,1
"But that messaging may have little resonance with the Japanese public, as covid infections in Tokyo have risen to a six-month high and the domestic vaccine rollout has proceeded slowly.",0
"And now we want to show the world that we have overcome covid, but we haven’t overcome it at all yet.",0
Similar mandates have gained momentum among both public and private employers as cases have jumped across the country with the spread of the Delta variant.,0
Some healthcare workers say the latest surges in covid are adding to fatigue and burnout.,0
But this time exhaustion is amplified by something new: frustration over the insufficient uptake of vaccines that could have prevented most covid patients from landing in their care.,0
"The Delta variant has pushed up U.S. covid infections to averages of about 100,000 a day, federal data show, levels last breached before vaccines were available to many Americans.",0
"Hospitalizations and deaths have climbed less sharply nationwide, but in some parts of the country where vaccination rates are lower , more people are hospitalized for covid than ever.",0
Hospitalizations and deaths have climbed less sharply nationwide,1
"More than 1,000 covid patients are hospitalized throughout Arkansas, according to federal data, nearing the state\'s all-time peak in January of just under 1,200 patients.",0
"Earlier in the pandemic, healthcare workers tending to covid patients in overrun hospitals were lauded as heroes.",1
"""it is too late for them to get the vaccine, and a lot of them are realizing it, so it is been pretty demoralizing,"" she said.",0
Many pushed forward to help ease the suffering as waves of patients moved through hospitals and ICUs.,0
"medical director of critical care at Houston Methodist Hospital, said the arrival of the covid vaccines in December felt like an early Christmas present.",1
"For a while, things improved, he said, and many healthcare workers hoped the pandemic\'s worst days were behind them.",1
Now patients are filling up the hospital again.,0
The number of covid patients across the seven Houston Methodist hospitals jumped from 127 on July 7 to 646 by Aug. 9.,0
"About 82% of them are unvaccinated , and those who are vaccinated are often older or have weakened immune systems",0
"The U.S. was averaging more than 9,700 new covid hospital admissions a day as of Aug. 9, according to federal data, 31% higher than the previous week.",0
"That is below the peak of more than 16,400 daily hospitalizations in early January.",1
" But the Delta variant has pummeled Southern and Midwestern states including Texas, Florida, Alabama, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi and Arkansas.",0
" Each has full-vaccination coverage below the national rate of 59% among eligible people, though vaccination rates are rising again in some of those states.",1
"Patients at Our Lady of Lourdes Regional Medical Center in Lafayette, La., tend to be younger and sicker than earlier in the pandemic as well as unvaccinated, said Chief Medical Officer Henry Kaufman.",0
He described the surge as heartbreaking for doctors and nurses who spent months touting the safety and efficacy of vaccines. ,0
"""We have a tool available to the community, to individuals, to keep them from having a hospitalized infection, and people just aren\'t accessing that at enough of a rate to keep the community safe,"" Dr. Kaufman said.",0
"About 50% of beds at the center\'s main campus were filled with covid patients last week, its highest ratio yet.",0
"The ICU is full, prompting doctors to place critically ill patients in emergency rooms and other overflow areas.",0
"Some healthcare workers say they are disheartened by the difference between the scene inside hospitals—where they are treating patients struggling to breathe—and the mood at businesses and public places in their communities, where much of public life has returned to normal.",0
"""We\'re losing people every day, and then you go to the store and you see nobody wearing masks,"" said Debi Delapaz, a nurse manager in a covid unit at UF Health Jacksonville in Florida.",0
Less than 44% of Wyoming\'s eligible population is fully vaccinated .,0
"About 16 people are being hospitalized for covid in the state a day, federal data show, an increase of about 5.8% from the previous week.",0
"In recent weeks, fights have broken out at an anti-transgender rights protest at a Westlake spa, an anti-mask protest outside a West Hollywood cancer center and an anti-vaccination protest at a West Hollywood restaurant.",0
"""There\'s so much uncertainty and so many conflicting pieces of information,"" Mr. Martin added, referring to the spread of the Delta variant of covid.",0
 The least-vaccinated states saw the greatest increase in first doses over the summer,1
"After weeks of stagnation, the U.S. vaccination campaign has had a relatively successful month, with vaccine uptake rising from early-summer lows in every state in the country.",1
"The upswing in vaccinations has come alongside an extended, and much more pronounced, increase in covid cases, hospitalizations and deaths in the United States over the past two months.",0
"Public health officials say that in their communities, residents have been driven to get the vaccine by worries that the more-transmissible delta variant might make them, or their loved ones, sick.",0
"“The reason why we’ve seen the marked increase in demand is fear, it’s the delta variant,” said Robert Ator, a retired National Guard colonel who runs Arkansas’ vaccination effort.",0
The increase in vaccinations has been especially pronounced in states where immunization levels were (and remain) below the national average of 61%.,1
Many of those states have felt the effects of the delta-led fourth wave most acutely.,0
"“Some communities are seeing COVID close-up now,” said Dr. Mandy Cohen, secretary of the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services.",0
"Public health officials said that some areas with lower vaccine coverage, especially rural ones, just hadn’t been severely affected by the virus until the delta surge.",0
"States that have seen larger increases in new cases since their early-summer nadirs, such as Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi, tend to be those with bigger increases in new vaccinations.",0
"Some of the recent rise in immunizations is due to teens and tweens who are heading back to school, but the bulk of the increase is from working-age Americans, public health officials say and data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirms.",0
"And while new vaccinations may be flattening now overall in the U.S., health officials do not expect them to return to previous lows any time soon, especially after the Food and Drug Administration on Monday granted full approval to the Pfizer vaccine.",1
"That move is likely to spur new vaccinations, in ways both direct — 31% of unvaccinated people surveyed in a June poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation indicated they would be more open to getting the jab once a vaccine was fully approved — and indirect, as it sets the stage for new vaccine requirements by organizations including corporations, hospitals and colleges.",1
" While the uptick in new vaccinations — first doses — has been the subject of particular interest, total vaccine doses, comprising first and second jabs, have been on the rise as well.",1
The FDA this month opened eligibility for third shots for some people with weakened immune systems.,1
"If the FDA approves that recommendation, boosters will be available starting in late September.",1
"As a result, these states may show a decrease in vaccinations in this analysis.",0
"Note: Not all states had hit their lowest weekly vaccinations in early June, when delta was on the verge of becoming dominant, and some only had mild growth in late July and August.",0
They allege that these states may be preventing districts from meeting the needs of students with disabilities who are at heightened risk for severe illness should they contract the covid.,0
Proponents of mandates point to the highly contagious delta variant. ,0
"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says masks are among the most effective tools to prevent the spread of the virus, and it recommends universal masking in schools as part of a layered mitigation strategy. ",1
"""The Department will fight to protect every student\'s right to access in-person learning safely,"" he said, ""and the rights of local educators to put in place policies that allow all students to return to the classroom full-time in-person safely this fall.""",1

"Vrabel, who is vaccinated against covid, waited in his car until the result came back. It was positive.",0
" But breakthrough infections for the vaccinated, especially while cases in the U.S. remain high due to the highly contagious Delta variant, aren\'t just possible. They\'re a reality.",0
" The New Orleans Saints had multiple individuals , including at least six vaccinated coaches, test positive in the past week.",0
"The symptom profile for vaccinated individuals—which now encompasses about 96% of NFL players and high-level staff—is milder, according to both public health data and the league\'s own results.",1
"With vaccinations supplanting some of the old, onerous, expensive strategies, organizations are looking to add in easier layers of extra protection.",1
"But those same symptoms also make it a difficult proposition. Last year, before vaccines, Sills says the league saw many of its infected individuals get ""significantly sick,"" including a couple cases of hospitalizations.",0

Data from a federally funded study suggested a full-strength dose of Moderna could hugely boost the antibody levels of Johnson & Johnson recipients and increase the antibody levels of Pfizer recipients better than an additional shot of the same vaccine.,1
"In contrast, some F.D.A. experts and committee members argued that Johnson & Johnson recipients needed an additional shot to better bolster them against severe covid, since that vaccine was less effective than those of Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech.",0
"The experts appeared swayed by the idea that a single shot of Johnson & Johnson\'s vaccine never offered as much protection as the vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, and thus needed to be shored up.",0

The initial studies also showed that it was 85% effective at preventing severe or critical disease. But the original clinical trials and most subsequent studies were done before the delta variant became responsible for almost all of the covid cases in the U.S.,0
"None of the infected patients who received the vaccine developed severe covid, while 11 (12%) of those who received the placebo did. Similarly, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, was 90% effective in preventing infection during the phase 3 clinical trial, which enrolled 43,538 participants, with 30% in U.S. and 42% abroad",1

"In the best-case scenario, as those numbers fall, many Americans may soon be able to reclaim much of their prepandemic lives.",1
"But the more contagious a variant, the higher the percentage of vaccinated people needed to reach the threshold. When the Alpha variant surfaced, scientists revised the herd immunity requirement level to 90 percent.",0
There are still millions in the United States and elsewhere who have no protection from the virus and no plans to be immunized.,0
"Booster shots are needed to prevent Omicron infection, and only about half of eligible Americans have received them.",0
"Moreover, scientists know little about the strength or duration of immunity left by an Omicron infection, and they do know that the protection against infections conferred by vaccines wanes after a relatively short period. ",0
"If the population’s protection against the virus is weak or transient, as is possible, then Americans may continue to experience outbreaks large enough to flood hospitals for years.",0
"The lack of widespread vaccination, in the United States and worldwide, coupled with the uncertainty regarding the strength of immunity left behind by Omicron, opens the door to the possibility of new variants.",0
"The protection gained from a Delta or Omicron infection may not be as effective against new variants, as the virus is changing unexpectedly quickly and in unusual ways.",0
"Neither vaccines nor infections offer so-called sterilizing immunity, meaning that the protection they offer appears to weaken over time.",0
"Even if the next variant is as mild as Omicron or even milder, a highly contagious variant may still wreak havoc on the health care system.",0
Many rural counties are having a bizarre drop in cases.,1
"It isn't clear when Delta will end, but it may become endemic if it doesn’t leave soon.",0
Medical professionals are hopeful that the rise in cases will start to drop off before the summer.,1
It is time to go back to school and begin reopening up. Cases are down and hospitals aren’t filled up anymore.,1
What really matters are hospitalization rates. It doesn’t matter that covid cases are increasing because hospitalization rates are continuing to plummet.,1
The worst of the Omicron wave is behind us and we can begin living back to normal. ,1
"Being sick at home for a few days is okay, we never closed down for the flu before. Our covid treatments are working and we should begin acting like it.",1
Every major pandemic indicator has been falling for weeks.,1
All major indicators of COVID-19 transmission in the United States continue to fall rapidly.,1
"Weekly new cases have fallen from 1.7 million at the national peak in early January to fewer than 600,000 this week, and cases have declined in every state.",1
"As we’ve seen at many points in the pandemic, case numbers are changing most quickly, with hospitalizations and deaths declining after a delay: Cases have been falling sharply for five weeks, hospitalizations for four, and deaths for two.",1
"In this week’s numbers from nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities, we are now seeing solid declines in deaths correlated with COVID-19 vaccinations in this most vulnerable population.",1
"If we look at cartograms of the United States showing weekly new cases for the worst week in January and for the week ending yesterday, the drop in the number of cases in each state is startling.",1
" Although states are still reporting large numbers of cases, many more parts of the country show absolute levels much closer to what we saw before the most recent surge accelerated nationally in October.",1
"COVID-19 hospitalizations, too, have fallen very sharply.",1
Every region and subregion of the U.S. now shows substantial declines in the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients.,1
"Despite the declines, the total number of people hospitalized is still very high—hospitalizations have yet to fall far enough to reach even the peaks of the two previous surges, which both rose to roughly 60,000 hospitalizations.",0
"Throughout the pandemic, the age-adjusted risk of contracting and dying from the coronavirus has been higher for people of color.",0
"Vaccines are finally showing up in the data, right where we most want to see them. According to the CDC, more than 16 million Americans have now received two doses of either the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccine since late December.",1
"During the clinical trials, all of the front-runner COVID-19 vaccines were 100 percent effective at preventing hospitalizations and deaths, even among the oldest participants.",1
"Now, with the data through February 11, the shift is clear: Deaths are falling in long-term-care facilities. Cases, too, have plummeted.",1
"As important, deaths in these facilities are declining not just in absolute numbers, but as a share of COVID-19 deaths in the whole country.",1
"In early January, the percentage of COVID-19 deaths associated with outbreaks in long-term-care facilities decreased below 30 percent for the first time since we began collecting LTC data, in May, and it has continued to decrease since.",1
 confounding analysis of both their individual states and the national numbers—the number of deaths in long-term-care facilities has fallen 50 percent from the peak of reported deaths in mid-January.,1
"But deaths are clearly falling among all age groups in the U.S., so one could imagine that the declines in long-term-care facilities merely reflect this broader pattern.",1
"For months, the share of deaths linked to long-term-care facilities bounced between 30 and 40 percent. In mid-January, it was still 29 percent. Then, over the past three weeks, the share of deaths associated with LTC outbreaks began to decline.",1
"For the week ending February 11, long-term-care-linked deaths represented just 18 percent of total reported deaths in the states where we have these data. One way to think about this is that the share of deaths associated with long-term-care facilities has been cut in half since early January.",1
"But this week, we have clear evidence that the vaccines are saving lives in exactly the places where we would expect to see their effects show up first. We are—at long last and after so many failures—beginning to protect the most vulnerable.",1
"New COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths all dropped this week.",1
"The good news in COVID-19 data continued this week, as new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths all dropped. ",1
"January was the pandemic’s deadliest month so far, but reported COVID-19 deaths declined this week—the first weekly drop since mid-October that is not correlated with a holiday reporting period.",1
"Despite the decline, deaths remained arrestingly high: 21,288 were reported in the past seven days.",0
"In another 32 states, new cases declined by at least 10 percent, and only a single state—Texas—posted a double-digit increase in the same period.",1
"These case declines are very welcome, but are taking place against a backdrop of very high viral transmission.",0
"Despite the past three weeks of precipitous drops, U.S. cases are still about three times higher than the previous lows following the summer’s Sun Belt surge—and even during those lows, the United States was still reporting an average of more than 30,000 cases a day.",0
Improvements continue in COVID-19 hospitalizations as well. ,1
"Since the beginning of the year, we’ve seen hospitalization declines ranging from 33 to 44 percent in the Midwest, the West, and one part of the South—the East South Central subregional division, which includes Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi, and Tennessee.",1
"however, reported deaths appear to have entered a genuine decline, reflecting the drop in cases and hospitalizations.",1
"Cases and deaths in American nursing homes and other long-term-care facilities appeared to spike in our most recent week of data for these facilities, which runs January 22 through January 28—about a week behind our main data set.",0
"As we found in a recent analysis, in most states, the racial and ethnic groups at higher risk of contracting or dying of COVID-19 have not changed.",0
"New cases per capita are declining across most communities we’re able to track, but disparities in the groups mostly likely to test positive—which in most U.S. states are Black, Latino, and Indigenous people—have not gone away.",0
We have yet to see comprehensive action directed at addressing disparities in risk or outcomes in the United States.,0
"Cases and hospitalizations are dropping fast, and the seven-day average for reported deaths has begun to drop as well.",1
"The statewide decline is likely in part a result of reduced demand following a drop in infections, but a sharp drop in testing is not what we’d like to see in a state where hospitalizations are still very high and multiple variants of SARS-CoV-2 are confirmed to be circulating.",0
"At the same time, L.A. County deaths among Latino people are occurring at three times the rate of white people, and Latino deaths due to COVID-19 are up 1,000 percent in the county since November.",0
"California Governor Gavin Newsom announced last week that the state’s vaccine allocation will soon prioritize residents 65 and older—rather than essential workers or younger people with underlying medical conditions, leading disability advocates to argue that health officials are neglecting vulnerable populations in a quest for greater efficiency.",0
"Arizona still has the highest per-capita COVID-19 hospitalizations in the country, despite several weeks of hospitalization declines—a testament to how high the state’s numbers really were at the peak of its current outbreak.",0
"The state’s official positivity rate continues to decline; last week’s 16 percent was the lowest since Thanksgiving, and the partial data for this week are at 14 percent.",1
"In Texas, hospitalizations are declining, reflecting improvements in some regionalized outbreaks, but they remain very high.",0
"Texas is the second-most-populous state in the country and is now fourth in the U.S. for COVID-19 hospitalizations per capita. This translates to a lot of people in the hospital with the virus: about 11,000 today, compared with California’s 14,500. ",0
"New-case reporting remains erratic in Texas, and appears to be very closely tied to fluctuations in testing, which suggests that the state is still not doing enough tests to keep pace with the virus.",0
